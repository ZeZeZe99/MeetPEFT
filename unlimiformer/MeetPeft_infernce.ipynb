But having to think about I can't wait for for for only people with that background to lead or, you know, police accountability where, you\\nspeaker 8: know, we have a huge community of individuals of color and men of color in particular, to whom police accountability is really important. I can't only represent that issue if I've walked in their shoes. Cathy inspired me and sent the message that you have to lead for all of those communities with their experience and partnership, right?\\nspeaker 8: Hearing TE and others talk about how she worked with you and that model of trying to see, I might not have walked in those shoes, but if I can be alongside you, right? Those are the things that I took.\\nspeaker 8: And in my early terms on the council, I would get the short emails. You know, some of you might have served before the email era, but I would get the short email from Cathy and I would pretty much know in that one sentence if she liked or did not like a quote in the paper or a vote\\nspeaker 8: that I had taken. And I learned to pick up the phone and call her, especially when she didn't like it and she was so curious. She would always actually want to hear why I had voted differently than she thought.\\nspeaker 8: And she never cut me off, right? She never was like, You're dead to me because you voted against. She would say, okay, well, I hate it, but you know, and then we'd move on and I'd get the next email and I had done okay.\\nspeaker 8: She was still serving on the Citizens Oversight Board in my first term, and that was a topic that we talked about right when there were some hard moments. Our our former monitor had a little more contentious relationship with our safety agencies than our most recent monitor did.\\nspeaker 8: And she, as someone who loved the city, loved the mayor and loved the safety agencies, was also really willing to hold them accountable. She did not think those two things were mutually exclusive. And I continue to feel that same way that I can love the city while also wanting us to do better and holding us accountable to\\nspeaker 8: those high standards. So those are the things I've taken personally. And as her health began to struggle, we tried to remember her in these chambers in terms of celebrating the anniversaries of the nondiscrimination ordinance as part of the history.\\nspeaker 8: And I remember going to visit her at the house. And I will just say for me personally, I often heard from Rick and Cathy together. I kind of feel like I got to know you together. And it's for me very fitting that so much of her service you are so involved in.\\nspeaker 8: And so I want to say thank you to you as well, because that inspiration, the trust, the watchful eye, all of that, I feel like was really something you did as a team, and it meant a lot to me, even though I did not work with her in the same way you all did.\\nspeaker 8: I felt that mentorship and I felt that support and I felt those high standards and they made me a better councilwoman. So thank you to all of you for the service that you performed for our city and thank you to her family.\\nspeaker 8: We know a little bit about the shared sacrifice that a family has for service. And so I thank you for the last dinners, the interrupted birthdays and all the other things that helped make her service to our city so possible.\\nspeaker 8: So I'm really excited and thank you to my colleagues for bringing this forward. I think you found the perfect place. So thank you.\\nspeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Kenney, Councilman Cashman.\\nspeaker 3: Know. Thank you, Madam President. I thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Flynn, for bringing this this forward. This this pretty humbling for me. I've been I grew up in the Garden State of New Jersey. And on Halloween night, just a couple of weeks ago, I celebrated my 50, 50 years in Colorado, all of that, except for maybe one\\nspeaker 3: year in the city and county of Denver. And for a long time as a journalist, I had a community newspaper in South Denver. I spoke to a number of the folks in the room here, including Councilwoman Reynolds. But what I'm remembering when I when I was thinking about running and was even 13 or 14, I called my\\nspeaker 3: friend Lynn Preston Hall, who was an aide for Councilwoman Johnson. And I said, you know, how much time does this job take? And she said, Well, you know, she said, Paul, it would be up to you. You know, some people talk about working and then others of them actually work.\\nspeaker 3: And she said, My boss works so. I took that to heart and I've tried to work. I don't know that I would ever even aspire to the heights that Ms.. Reynolds achieved, but I do try to try to work.\\nspeaker 3: You know, I did speak with Councilwoman Reynolds a few times as a journalist, and I found her to be as described by some of the speakers. She was always would return my call, but she did not seem to be a particular fan of talking to the press, and she was always very direct.\\nspeaker 3: She would explain fully, answer my questions fully, but she was not a look at me person. She was. My sense was she was a let's let's get it done type of person. And as I said, you know, she was very direct and to the point.\\nspeaker 3: But I did she had the opportunity to see another side of her. The sense of humor that people talk about. I happened to be as actually to I believe that were Fridays to Fridays in a row. I happened to be playing golf over on a golf course and came off the first green.\\nspeaker 3: And there was this woman laughing her tail off on the second tee about 20 yards away and got a little bit closer. And it was Councilwoman Reynolds and I don't know what the topic was, but she was laughing about 200 yards down the fairway and having a great time.\\nspeaker 3: So I was pleased to hear that side of her. And the other thing I wanted to comment about when I first got elected to office, Albert Brooks was president at the time of council, and he appointed me. To the Urban Drainage and Flood Control Board, and who knew what that could possibly be?\\nspeaker 3: And why would I have been subjected to this? And what I came to find out, first of all, is it is one of the most well-run, marvelous organizations I've ever had the privilege to be associated with. I want to acknowledge Dave Bennetts, who's I think government relations manager now for the district and has had a remarkable career\\nspeaker 3: for that organization. And the other thing I want to say is when I took the position and Councilwoman Sussman was just leaving that role on the board, the only thing she had to tell me, she came over and whispered.\\nspeaker 3: She said, you had the best lunches you're ever going to eat. So, yeah, they they do a good job in that way. But I do want to thank all all the former council members here, former attorney muse Mr. Reynolds, and all the family members for for what you did in setting the table so all of us can\\nspeaker 3: be up here working for a city that's with all of its challenges in pretty good shape. So thank you, Madam President.\\nspeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. Councilmember Hines.\\nspeaker 3: Thank you. Council President, I this is my first term in office and I never met Miss Reynolds. Did not know her. I. Would say tonight, I want to thank the sponsors for their fabulous presentation. And and I want to thank the folks here in this room.\\nspeaker 3: It's just been such a delight to learn more about Ms.. Rental, Ms.. REYNOLDS And what a force she has been in our city. And I am also speaking of delight. I am delighted that she broke a barrier and helped us become, as you have already said, such a diverse council with majority women council, too.\\nspeaker 3: And so I just wanted to thank everyone for coming. I feel a little bit I feel like I know her a little bit better, and I'm excited to have this chambers named after her. Thank you.\\nspeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Hines. Councilmember Sandoval.\\nspeaker 5: Thank you, Madam President. Um, so I never had the honor of knowing Cathy, but I know my father, Paul Sandoval, did, and worked with her a great deal. And as a daughter of someone who was elected, I had to share my dad with the community.\\nspeaker 5: And I remember going places with my dad, and I would get tired of him talking to everyone. And I would just want my dad's attention. And we would go to on a cruise. I'll never forget we were in Mexico and my dad knew someone on the cruise in Mexico.\\nspeaker 5: And it all revolved around Denver politics. And so as a woman who is now currently elected and I have two children at home, I know the strain my dad carried and the strain that she probably carried of being a mother and being a wife and being a politician.\\nspeaker 5: And now I see my kids. I go places and my kids are like, Mom, come on, let's go. Do we have to keep talking? And so I just wanted to thank her family, her husband, who sat by her side.\\nspeaker 5: My husband's been there for me. I don't think anyone really knows what that's like. And her kids who she had, you had to share your mom with the community and what that feels like of people telling you stories about your mom that you didn't know and exploring things and hearing things.\\nspeaker 5: When I was campaigning, I learned more about my dad than I had known. I didn't know. I knew he had a big impact in northwest Denver, but I really learned it. Going knocking door to door and hearing. So just wanted to thank her family because this is a job where you don't get to go home when you\\nspeaker 5: just turn it off. You don't. You're everywhere you go. You're Councilwoman Sandoval. You're not the story. And so thank you for her family, for standing by her side for so long and standing in her, because I'm sure she needed to come home and she rented to you all, just like we all as mothers up here and fathers\\nspeaker 5: go home. And we went to our significant other in our kids. And so we're all in it together. And for all of you, other women who were elected, thank you for opening the door for me and for my family and for my ability to serve Northwest Denver and get things done.\\nspeaker 5: Thank you.\\nspeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval and see no other speakers in the queue. I'll go ahead and round it out tonight. I want to sincerely thank council members Flynn and Ortega for sponsoring this. And I see when Council member Flynn started to try to go down the roll call, it makes it tough.\\nspeaker 0: So I would just like to acknowledge and sincerely and humbly thank the former council members who are here with us this evening as well and online. You know, some of the things that were said about Kathy Reynolds tonight were she was a strong woman.\\nspeaker 0: She was a visionary. She was a passionate servant. She was a get it done sort of person. Her humor, her patience, her kindness and her generosity. Were things that you said over and over again in a little bit different way, but it gave us an opportunity sitting up here tonight to fill.\\nspeaker 0: For the ones of us that never met her, feel like we knew her just a little bit. And the humility and. Just great honor that it is to sit up here and serve our city and know the intentional work that it does take to do this job to the best of your ability and to her husband and\\nspeaker 0: her two children. I know a couple of my colleagues brought it up, but your sacrifices, because I think that she couldn't serve for almost 30 years and there weren't sacrifices that you all made as family. And that sacrifice changed policy and legislation in Denver for the betterment of citizens that you will never meet.\\nspeaker 0: But she did that and you allowed her to do that because having the support of your family members, when you go home to not talk about what happened, to talk about what happened in your life and in your day is so refreshing and so important for us to be able to continue doing our jobs and the coalition\\nspeaker 0: building. How she served on the the Citizen Oversight Board. Women's rights. I have two daughters and I want them to consider public service at some point. I want them to know that it's achievable for them and that they can do that and have a city or have excuse me, have a family and still serve the city in\\nspeaker 0: a good way, but that you're also serving your family at the same time. And so I'm very honored to support this this evening. And, Madam Secretary, roll call, please. Flynn.\\nspeaker 6: Just checking what the snow says. I don't have seven votes. I.\\nspeaker 0: Ortega, i. And we would like to ask council members who are in the chambers to all please stay so we can take a group photo with you and our seated council.\\nspeaker 7: I think Sandoval. Sawyer.\\nspeaker 0: I. Torres, I. Black. I.\\nspeaker 7: See tobacco.\\nspeaker 5: I. Clark.\\nspeaker 6: I.\\nspeaker 0: Herndon.\\nspeaker 1: I.\\nspeaker 3: Times i.\\nspeaker 7: Cashman.\\nspeaker 0: Can I?\\nspeaker 7: Madam President.\\nspeaker 0: I. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results.\\nspeaker 7: 13 eyes.\\nspeaker 0: 13. I count the bill. 21 guy. 13. 20. They're being for no further business before this body. This meeting is adjourned. Thank you.\\n\\n\" \\\n",

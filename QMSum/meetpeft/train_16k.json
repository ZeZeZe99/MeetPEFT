        "conversations": "Project Manager:Yep . Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . {vocalsound} Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . {vocalsound} Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over .\nUser Interface:The prototype discussion .\nProject Manager:The prototype yeah . Do you need a {disfmarker} this ?\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Can try to plug that in there\nUser Interface:There is our remo {gap} the banana .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um but it would be held in such a fashion ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .\nProject Manager:Very nice .\nUser Interface:And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um {vocalsound} that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:Is there anything you want to add ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface:Doesn't make much make much difference .\nIndustrial Designer:you have some rub yeah .\nUser Interface:You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose .\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly , {gap} use both . Might as well think about {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:T the actual thing might be smaller .\nIndustrial Designer:Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one {gap} one on either side or\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:What but what's that button ?\nIndustrial Designer:not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button .\nUser Interface:Just the on and off .\nProject Manager:Uh , 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:That's um\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Right ? Um that's not um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:There you go .\nUser Interface:It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Would you like to uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Pretty impressive .\nProject Manager:Well done .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Kind of a banana .\nUser Interface:And whether or not it would fall into the cost {gap} everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:Well luckily we are going to find out . Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I do . Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that . {gap} . Okay . So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think it's definitely different than anything else out there .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I would {gap} .\nProject Manager:It's bright .\nUser Interface:It's bright . It's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It still has your traditional black .\nUser Interface:It's curved . It's not {disfmarker} there's no sharp\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:angles to it .\nProject Manager:Yep , not angular .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:However the colour , we don't have a say in that .\nMarketing:Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Some people might say it . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yep .\nMarketing:That's true . Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah something more modern to go {disfmarker} a a modern colour to go with the modern form .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Right . It's different . You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .\nMarketing:Um okay so , do you think , since we {disfmarker} This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Does that sound good ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What do you think ? Three ? Four ?\nProject Manager:I would say\nMarketing:Five ?\nProject Manager:four . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Four is fair . Okay .\nProject Manager:Very non-committal , four .\nMarketing:Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's very intuitive , I think yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} S give it a one .\nMarketing:One ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:'kay . Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?\nUser Interface:Uh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls {gap} most common , which are channel and volume .\nMarketing:I'd say that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further .\nProject Manager:S scrolling through and selecting a few .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . So that's a one .\nMarketing:So one ?\nProject Manager:I think that's a one .\nMarketing:Yeah ? {vocalsound} Okay . Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints .\nIndustrial Designer:Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's bright yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned .\nProject Manager:So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily .\nIndustrial Designer:Oops . Hmm .\nUser Interface:And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well what {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And it is quite bright and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ?\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:S\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:I mean you know {gap} loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:That's true .\nProject Manager:But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah . You probably {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:I'd say two .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .\nProject Manager:Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap .\nMarketing:Annoying alarm or something ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So it can't be that\nIndustrial Designer:Um the {disfmarker} it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff ,\nUser Interface:expensive .\nProject Manager:Some sort of proximity {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your {disfmarker} stick it behind your T_V_ and the other {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} stick it on the T_V_ {gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That'd be tough then . {vocalsound} Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:So . Are we adding one of these two features ?\nIndustrial Designer:Let's add one of those features and say yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} gonna say {disfmarker} okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So we're {vocalsound} back to a one ?\nUser Interface:Two .\nMarketing:Or a two ?\nProject Manager:Two .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nMarketing:Two , 'kay . Okay . Are we technologically innovative ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'd say so .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh don't get many mo remote controls with\nIndustrial Designer:It's all just {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:screens on .\nIndustrial Designer:It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah it's stolen technology .\nMarketing:From iPod yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But we have {gap} .\nProject Manager:But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:right\nMarketing:But for remotes {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Course that wasn't really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:right\nUser Interface:Fa\nIndustrial Designer:right right .\nProject Manager:we were kinda forced to take that colour .\nMarketing:Two ? Three ?\nUser Interface:{gap} 'cause it's stolen .\nProject Manager:I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No maybe not .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah not really .\nMarketing:But how many remotes do you see like this ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:If we added the screaming factor {vocalsound} then we go up .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Not so many .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um I would say we're probably at four .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Really ? Okay . {vocalsound} That's gonna hurt us .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . Um spongy material ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of .\nProject Manager:We have some spongy , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah as much as as needed , I think .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not a one though .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:One would be the whole thing\nProject Manager:Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side {disfmarker} the bottom {disfmarker} the underneath on the back .\nIndustrial Designer:to fold and stuff . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's a four at most .\nProject Manager:Probably a four at most . Possibly even a five .\nMarketing:And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Y yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I'd say we did .\nProject Manager:If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:More {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,\nUser Interface:On the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's true .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but it definitely is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:'Kay . Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen . Seventeen divided by s\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Seven is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Eight .\nProject Manager:Two point {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} two point four ?\nUser Interface:Is that some long division ? No .\nProject Manager:Something .\nMarketing:Well I haven't done math in years .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What two {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I dunno .\nUser Interface:Just , I'm sure there's a {gap} .\nMarketing:Okay we'll say two point four two . Right ? How does that look ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No I can't do long {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's been a while .\nUser Interface:very impressive .\nProject Manager:And what what is the acceptable criteria ? Is there like a scale that we have to hit ?\nMarketing:Oh no . They just told me to\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it {vocalsound} basically .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright then .\nMarketing:So that's that .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well , let's see .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . But we do . Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that . It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on .\nMarketing:Oh my god .\nUser Interface:Two point four two basically .\nMarketing:Okay . Yeah we'll go with that .\nProject Manager:So I have here an {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Fifty percent , you're kidding .\nMarketing:Not too shabby .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} P\nProject Manager:We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Charge about three hundred quid for it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . Okay , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's too much .\nProject Manager:Well let's see .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The f the {disfmarker} Wonder if I can make this {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh it won't let me do that . Okay . Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories .\nIndustrial Designer:Battery .\nProject Manager:We have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . Okay so {disfmarker} Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Probably some e either two or four .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nProject Manager:Two ? {vocalsound} Like it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Excellent .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} They won't know until after they bought it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This is consumerism .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nUser Interface:We're advanced chip are we ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay , {gap} we have one of those . 'Kay then the case is a {disfmarker} Probably it's double curved .\nIndustrial Designer:Double curved , yes .\nProject Manager:Case materials are\nIndustrial Designer:Plastic .\nProject Manager:plastic . Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom .\nIndustrial Designer:N no .\nProject Manager:Is that right or is it just one ?\nIndustrial Designer:No that's just one .\nProject Manager:Maybe it's one because of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's just one mo single mould , we can do that .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Yeah {gap} yeah .\nMarketing:Right . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice .\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly , right .\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:Special colour ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's not a special colour . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special .\nMarketing:Bright yellow .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:S\nIndustrial Designer:S {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we actually have the L_C_D_ display\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and then is it the integrated or is it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I'd say the integrated .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes unfortunately .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um special form ? Special material .\nIndustrial Designer:We could of course make the buttons wood .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Say mahogany or so\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It'd look really lovely .\nProject Manager:Or titanium .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm or titanium .\nProject Manager:They cost us all the same .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} remote control {gap} .\nProject Manager:Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements .\nUser Interface:No that's getting a bit tiny .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'd ignore that .\nMarketing:Leave it blank .\nProject Manager:Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five . Which I believe is\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's too much .\nProject Manager:by three Euros over .\nIndustrial Designer:It's hard to believe . So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake .\nUser Interface:If it w What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .\nProject Manager:Yeah 'cause the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well 'cause we have to have both right ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So s yeah let's take away the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ?\nUser Interface:Uh that is possible yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . We may not need it . There you go .\nProject Manager:Well there we go .\nIndustrial Designer:Perfect .\nProject Manager:Twelve point five .\nUser Interface:There we go .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Perfect .\nProject Manager:Okay . So we just remove our {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Screen .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:screen here .\nUser Interface:Make it a bigger dial .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Easier to use . Even easier to use then .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay , the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Back to the design room boys .\nIndustrial Designer:So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:there you go . {gap} central ?\nMarketing:What's the blue part ?\nUser Interface:That was just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh that's just {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:we ran out of yellow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh that's the batteries .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:There you go\nUser Interface:There you go .\nIndustrial Designer:. Oops .\nUser Interface:Even simpler .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Looks more like a banana .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:There you go .\nUser Interface:For all those fruit lovers out there .\nIndustrial Designer:One more criteria .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Next slide . Project evaluation . Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . Um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} Let's see here . I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But I'd like to hear your thoughts .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Fair enough . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Trying to fill in some time there . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh h what did you think of our project process ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Great . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think we did {disfmarker} yeah I think we did quite well . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Good .\nMarketing:Good teamwork {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Right from the start of the day .\nProject Manager:Yeah I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought .\nProject Manager:{gap} we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ? Which was the whiteboard and the pens .\nUser Interface:Yeah . We've used the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer:Super super .\nProject Manager:I had some problem with the pen I think , but {vocalsound} minus your p\nMarketing:Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well that's not my fault . That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me ,\nMarketing:No I know . I'm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:yeah . Incom {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:uh they've just you know {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Have a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Heads are gonna roll , believe me .\nProject Manager:we have a list of employees that you would like fired .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . N new ideas found ? Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Kinda .\nProject Manager:Yes for the remote . Maybe no not f for\nUser Interface:Technology used .\nProject Manager:technology . Alright . Closing . Costs are within the budget . Project is evaluated . Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . That's it .\nUser Interface:Excellent .\nProject Manager:And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Actually . Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that .\nMarketing:We might have a while though .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nProject Manager:But that's the end of our meeting .\n",
        "summary": "Firstly, Project Manager reviewed the overall process that the team designed the remote control that they had viewed the fashion trends and incorporated the key features. After that, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was yellow like a banana with a simplest quick on-off button and could be used both-handed. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test according to criteria found of the market trend as well as the customers' complaints and the team gave one to seven points to the shape, colour, material, controls and functions of the product. Thirdly, the team found that the current product exceeded the budget, so the team decided to completely discard the single button and LCD. Lastly, the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:That should hopefully do the trick , um . 'Kay . Sorry about the small delay . Falling a little bit behind schedule . And that's uh fifteen twenty five . Okay . So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? Uh The new black , I believe .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course . Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . Okay . So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype .\nUser Interface:Okay , it's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} I think if we both step up\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:and uh outline our ideas . Okay . Now do {disfmarker} uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{gap} ju just a thought . You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . But as you as you see with the uh {vocalsound} with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain {gap} ergonomic design . Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down .\nProject Manager:I'm afraid yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We'll go into that a bit more ,\nUser Interface:{gap} this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing .\nProject Manager:but please go on .\nUser Interface:Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . So .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Any further comments ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , won't it ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause it {disfmarker} you can't get it curved .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I mean the\nIndustrial Designer:Uh because of costs .\nUser Interface:uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have {gap} the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh {vocalsound} of the rigid substructure . So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm . Lovely . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah . Great . Um .\nMarketing:Right . Yeah I've got a {disfmarker} if you load up my evaluation document .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay {gap} .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Excellent work .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:Uh evaluation . {vocalsound} Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . {vocalsound} Um then we will {disfmarker} it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . So um not seven steps , seven scale . So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . And uh the criteria {gap} based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . 'Kay . Um if you flip the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , those are the criteria . And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means {vocalsound} that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Put it mildly . So we have um true ? One , t Seven , eight , oh . Fourth . Okay , so we have to go through each point . If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score . So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . I mean , uh is the homing thing still {disfmarker} the locator , is that still {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's still part of the design .\nMarketing:Sure . And Adam , we can keep that in ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I believe so . So I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:'cause that would mean doing something about the human element ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Sure .\nProject Manager:but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have .\nMarketing:T\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm . And making it a bright colour helps\nMarketing:Sure .\nUser Interface:with the {disfmarker} personally I would have gone for purple {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Bright colour . So we still have that noise thing , yeah ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Os on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding {gap} finding it once it's lost ?\nUser Interface:I'd say number one .\nMarketing:Number one ?\nIndustrial Designer:One . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . Number number one for the first criteria .\nUser Interface:I think w if it was just the sounder then th {gap} I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is .\nMarketing:Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Bu\nIndustrial Designer:What about {disfmarker} what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume {gap} can't find remote . Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm . Um\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker {gap} .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is\nMarketing:You wanna say something ?\nProject Manager:um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright .\nMarketing:That's fine .\nProject Manager:Yeah , is that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh that's that's fine .\nProject Manager:Um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this .\nMarketing:What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ?\nMarketing:Um , a few . {vocalsound} Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . So they say we put the fashion in electronics , well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:so . That's this bit right here . And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . And we can come back to it , you said .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So .\nProject Manager:No and which we will do very very shortly . Um . Okay . Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , {gap} require more buttons , etcetera . Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . So we're just managing it really . Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um .\nMarketing:Different languages ?\nProject Manager:That should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . {vocalsound} We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . Um . We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h {vocalsound} is have it um circular and have it s {vocalsound} so that the uh the pink {gap} actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:So that uh th\nProject Manager:It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . Um .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ?\nProject Manager:Um b b b da is {disfmarker} you mean on the plastic , or ?\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Let's have a look . You now have as much information as I do . {vocalsound} Um .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:So as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one . We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .\nMarketing:Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? That's quite significantly expensive .\nProject Manager:I {disfmarker} that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . Um\nMarketing:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm . {gap} yeah .\nProject Manager:as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .\nMarketing:We don't even have uh speakers here . The {disfmarker} like uh we uh {disfmarker} what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh no , we haven't , not {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Is that gonna be a button , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That'll {gap} it literally would just be a button .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We might have to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's too expensive {gap} isn't it ?\nProject Manager:It looks like almost nothing {disfmarker} Mm . Oh good call , I missed that .\nMarketing:I I mean it's not on here , but um .\nProject Manager:{gap} that's a very valid point .\nMarketing:Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Well that's {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display , then that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What's a hand dyna dynamo ? You have to wind it up ?\nProject Manager:I believe so , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Technology . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Fashion .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now .\nProject Manager:Being manipulated by the joystick , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , and joystick , yeah .\nProject Manager:Which I'm defining as scroll wheel . Um .\nMarketing:And we couldn't replace the joystick , right ? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a {disfmarker} but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of\nProject Manager:If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves\nIndustrial Designer:the remote .\nProject Manager:a fair amount . Which you could {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But that's what makes it uh original though ,\nUser Interface:Mm . I think {gap} if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:isn't it ?\nUser Interface:and we just {gap} we could just put our branding on any other remote control .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah . Um . Uh k\nProject Manager:It's a shame . We should possibly have {disfmarker} If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to .\nMarketing:Does this does this bear in mind that {disfmarker} I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components ,\nProject Manager:Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one .\nMarketing:you know .\nProject Manager:Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm {disfmarker} we're gonna have to stick with these figures .\nMarketing:Mm . 'Kay .\nProject Manager:So , I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , {vocalsound} despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um\nMarketing:I think so .\nProject Manager:are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Um yeah {gap} I mean one thing , I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean {vocalsound} keep the um the articulation ?\nProject Manager:It's hard to tell . Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved ,\nUser Interface:This is what I'm wondering .\nProject Manager:and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation .\nUser Interface:Oh\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:no , I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved .\nIndustrial Designer:It can be s yeah , it can still be single curved ,\nUser Interface:It's uh it's just {vocalsound} it's just {vocalsound} it's just that the case would come in t {vocalsound} would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Single curved with articulation ?\nIndustrial Designer:You just {gap} .\nMarketing:Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'Cause like we {disfmarker} do we have re restrictions on software ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's what we need for the joystick I think though .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah , I mean\nMarketing:Oh but there has to be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:and {vocalsound} I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . Um I mean {gap} yeah ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But the curves all o over {gap} hand ,\nUser Interface:on the {gap} on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it\nProject Manager:is it ?\nUser Interface:could just as easily be done um without curves . The curve that's really needed is up here ,\nMarketing:{gap} joystick .\nUser Interface:to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand .\nMarketing:Okay . Sure . Okay , my bad .\nProject Manager:We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal .\nMarketing:So I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria .\nProject Manager:Which is what we can get onto now . As long as {disfmarker} so are we gonna say {disfmarker} {gap} w we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we're gonna say um single curved design {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh , wait a minute . Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ? Is that somewhat similar to what we want ?\nProject Manager:It could well be ,\nUser Interface:Mm no\nProject Manager:but at a cost of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:that's that voice response thing that we got the email about .\nIndustrial Designer:Costs four .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But I thought it was just completely pointless .\nMarketing:You got a email about voice response ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I did not ,\nUser Interface:Alright .\nMarketing:so .\nUser Interface:B i basically it was {gap} saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one .\nMarketing:We won't go with that one , did you say ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's voice recognition , so .\nMarketing:I mean I {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} Okay , okay .\nProject Manager:Um . So , okay yeah , battery definitely , {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca {vocalsound} locator thing .\nProject Manager:It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Maybe even slight well oh yeah , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . So we'll leave that one for now . {gap} we'll just have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Are we going for a special colour at all ?\nProject Manager:It's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure . One {disfmarker} point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . Um .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well\nProject Manager:At which point if {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I was {gap} for a case . Or had you already incorporated that ?\nMarketing:Oh , special colour for the case .\nProject Manager:Well you got point five there . It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . I'm not quite sure if they're {disfmarker} I don't think they mean point five Euros per button .\nUser Interface:Okay , well\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case\nProject Manager:So\nUser Interface:and then we at least have {disfmarker} make it a little harder to lose .\nProject Manager:There we go .\nUser Interface:Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room .\nMarketing:W what's the default colour ? White or black ?\nProject Manager:Black's probably the normal colour you'd say ,\nUser Interface:Or grey .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:I quite like that colour that you're fetching there ,\nUser Interface:Yellow . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So will we go with that then ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's not and we can see {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:we'll come back to uh your evaluation\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Sure .\nProject Manager:which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time . We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet ,\nMarketing:Right okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:but .\nIndustrial Designer:Think it's ten minutes left . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ten .\nMarketing:'Kay . Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . Um . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Special colour .\nMarketing:Special colour .\nProject Manager:Mm mm four ?\nMarketing:Uh uh four .\nProject Manager:Three ? Mm .\nUser Interface:Three . I think we can do three .\nMarketing:Three if we're being generous , I feel .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Th the special colour doesn't {disfmarker} would I think make a difference .\nMarketing:Think we're being generous here with three .\nIndustrial Designer:Three .\nUser Interface:It makes it stand out from {disfmarker} you know it's lost in a big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Reduce the number of unused buttons . We're down to t two buttons , is it ?\nUser Interface:Two buttons and a joystick .\nProject Manager:Two buttons .\nMarketing:Okay , so that's a one . You know ,\nUser Interface:Totally .\nMarketing:where that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . I'd say we're doing well there .\nMarketing:Okay , that was good . Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus {gap}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:that's yeah that's good . {vocalsound} 'Kay that's {disfmarker} we're not doing so badly . Um {vocalsound} easy to use {disfmarker} oh okay , let's forget that one . Fancy looking . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} As he models the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It doesn't get much fancier .\nMarketing:Sure . And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_ . Yeah let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Maybe I was panicking for no reason .\nIndustrial Designer:Are we going one on {gap} ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:I'd say we go two , 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:I'd {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Wouldn't it ?\nMarketing:w maybe you'd be a bit too {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:yeah . There we go . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:With the articulators . With bells on it .\nMarketing:that's m that's that's better too . More accurate numbers . Technologically innovative . Well , we're getting rid of the locator thing\nProject Manager:Which is a shame .\nMarketing:which which\nUser Interface:Mm . I'd give it a three for this {disfmarker} for that .\nMarketing:yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No need for teletext .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote ,\nMarketing:'Kay .\nUser Interface:but {vocalsound} you see it in a lot of other places .\nMarketing:Yeah , mobile phones .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , so it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:You say three ? I might go as far as two on that . Three .\nUser Interface:I'd give it a three .\nProject Manager:I'd be tempted with three , yeah .\nMarketing:Three . Okay .\nProject Manager:We'll get panned on the next one , anyway .\nMarketing:Okay . Materials that people find pleasing .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , w\nMarketing:Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently .\nProject Manager:It is , yeah . Don't blame them .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Plastic , it sucks . But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have .\nMarketing:That's true . It's not a step backwards .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} five ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest .\nIndustrial Designer:Six ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , okay let's give it a six .\nIndustrial Designer:Six , {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , that's totally thrown everything off balance . Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . W we could . What colour were we gonna make it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Put a leopard print on it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I know ,\nUser Interface:Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype\nMarketing:but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:'cause we had yellow . If I were buying one , I'd go for purple . Leopard print would be cool .\nMarketing:But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg , {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah we gotta {gap} . I'd say the colour of the border there world {disfmarker} you'd find that , {gap} that's that'd stand out .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Like yellow , yeah . It would also help keep the the product placement s\nIndustrial Designer:Logo , brand .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Is it inspired by {gap} clothing fashion ?\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing:Is this like a banana type colour ? Could we stretch {disfmarker} no still , it's not shaped like a banana is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That's kinda {disfmarker} {gap} i\nProject Manager:It's kind o it\nUser Interface:it won't be when it's been\nProject Manager:probably {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh is that 'cause it's flat ?\nUser Interface:budgeted .\nMarketing:What is {disfmarker} what fruit or veg is flat ?\nUser Interface:I I think s I I think this isn't {disfmarker} not particularly fruit and veggie . Um .\nMarketing:Yeah . Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yellow courgette .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , {vocalsound} what , four ?\nMarketing:Four ? Oh that's it's very ambitious ,\nProject Manager:Is that being too generous ?\nUser Interface:Mm . I'd {vocalsound} I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . {vocalsound} Is the sole criterion for being um fashion {gap} fashionable or inspired by current fashions .\nMarketing:yeah , um .\nProject Manager:Oh dear , {gap} .\nMarketing:Sure . Inspired by {gap} .\nUser Interface:Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually .\nIndustrial Designer:Well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And we're we're not doing well on it .\nMarketing:This is their strategy . I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . Might {disfmarker} we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one .\nProject Manager:What would you think yourself ?\nMarketing:I would say {disfmarker} I mean it's it's not at all , right ? {vocalsound} In any way or shape or form .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well , it's kind of curved\nMarketing:We didn't m\nProject Manager:and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like .\nMarketing:Okay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay .\nProject Manager:Si it's got a curve to it .\nMarketing:Right five . Is that {vocalsound} sound reasonable ?\nProject Manager:Am I {disfmarker} do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I'll go with five .\nMarketing:Five . {vocalsound} Yeah . 'Kay , so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . Which gives us an average of three . It's {disfmarker} well this would be in the middle . So we it's it's not bad . It's in the good section .\nProject Manager:It's not bad and considering the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} don't pick the pen . Um .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oops . Sorry . {vocalsound} I'm I'm sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Y oh and you've knocked batteries out .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um right okay it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'S bad design , that thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive {disfmarker} you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly , based on um the the cost features .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , yeah .\nMarketing:Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do {disfmarker} I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so I think we're definitely on the good bit .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . You know , it's {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface:Mm . Personally , I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control\nMarketing:we did it w it was okay . It was good .\nUser Interface:that you've already got , are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , it depends who your {disfmarker} who's {disfmarker} what the target people are , like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious\nProject Manager:Maybe it's been targeted {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:women would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:it's yellow , looks like a banana , it's cool it's gotta {disfmarker} look good in the sitting room .\nProject Manager:Hide it in the fruit basket .\nIndustrial Designer:Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology {gap} it's good , it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick . So , which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ?\nProject Manager:Probably the people technologically . They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she's had it for a long time , you know . She uses it to make phone calls and that's it .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah . So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , you know .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:She'd be like is this a remote control , I don't {disfmarker} how do you use it , and stuff like that . So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . I s {vocalsound} I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative , um for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um .\nMarketing:I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:But like radical good , maybe .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um don't know how lo much longer we've got . At least five minutes I think . Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . Um . So , we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? For example um {disfmarker} we'll work backwards I suppose . The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . Um {gap} people made good use of the uh pen and paper ?\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:I would say {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:got notes and doodles .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Wrote nearly a page ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:but not {gap} .\nProject Manager:I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be .\nUser Interface:Well I think this is a {disfmarker} I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh\nMarketing:I think tracking .\nUser Interface:of the researchers studying this . It's all p goes into their corpus .\nProject Manager:It must {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves .\nMarketing:Yeah , that woulda been pretty good .\nProject Manager:It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . So maybe this is literally just a way around it . Um I dunno . How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ?\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nMarketing:I'd {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Good .\nMarketing:yeah I liked it , yeah .\nProject Manager:Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Very good .\nMarketing:I li yeah , top marks .\nProject Manager:Um last one we've got is room for creativity .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along ,\nProject Manager:Now , I think we got {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} squish .\nIndustrial Designer:We're burs bursting with creativity .\nMarketing:yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing:We we're not lacking in ideas , you know it's {disfmarker} that was not the problem .\nProject Manager:I think of {disfmarker} in the end , ideas that can be used {gap} sadly {gap} . Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . It's a bit of a pity .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um I would have to agree on that . I think we needed a larger budget .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Because they will pay outrageous cash to {gap}\nUser Interface:Mm . I mean I th {vocalsound} I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh\nProject Manager:first on the market .\nUser Interface:in added expense .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And the price was like {disfmarker} it was twice the w assembly cost . And would it have to be twice that ? It could be like coulda had the assembly {gap} like maybe fifteen Euro .\nProject Manager:It could even {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We'll still settle for twenty five {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:That's true , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess . As to a {gap} the costs involved . But I mean we've got a a prototype .\nUser Interface:Such as it is .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So I dunno , I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such .\nMarketing:Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more {disfmarker} Yeah , to begin with .\nIndustrial Designer:In the beginning , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Probably would have {disfmarker} mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I would have to agree . It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . Always hard to tell until you know the costs . Um . Okay . Are the costs within budget ? Well ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:We've evaluated it , and we can say that we came out with a value of three .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Actually I want th one thing I would say {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over {gap} going over-budget um m would make to sales .\nProject Manager:It's {disfmarker} yeah ?\nMarketing:And like response from consumers {gap} .\nUser Interface:And we could even you know , market two versions .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And then the final one where you get to call it Hal .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:But we'll go into that later .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Sure .\nProject Manager:Right um\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um {gap} anything they think that's not been covered , before I quickly write up a final report . Um I dunno , I mean we've got a product . We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . There is a huge market .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such .\nUser Interface:And I can get my bus . Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay , let's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh thank you for your participation .\nMarketing:Thank you .\nUser Interface:Thank you .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . It's like man , we we can't have the locator thing . And s yeah that's just bad . Do you think maybe {gap} the prices were were made ?\nProject Manager:That {gap} a question we can ask {gap} . {vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "Industrial Designer and User Interface presented a prototype of the new remote control according to the team's previous meetings. However, due to the budget limit, the team had to give up the spongy rubber material and the double-curved design. Instead, the remote control would be made of plastic and have only one curve. There would not be any location function, either. The team decided to make the remote control conspicuous by designing a bright yellow banana shape in case it got lost easily in a room. In the product evaluation, the team was satisfied with its success in reducing the number of unused buttons. The user interface was considered to be user-friendly enough. However, the team also admitted that there was still room for improvement on the location function, technological innovation, the material, as well as the fashion style of the remote control. At the end of the meeting, all team members expressed themselves about the teamwork sincerely.",

        "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and there is no substitute. Janet Finch-Saunders is joining us from the Assembly offices in Colwyn Bay via video conference. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill?\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. We've got a series of questions now from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Good morning. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses?\nKirsty Williams AM:Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required?\nKirsty Williams AM:Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. And I think there are a number of ways in which that can happen. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. The remit letters are a really important way in which we can lay out those national priorities. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon.\nSian Gwenllian AM:I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. That's clear enough. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity?\nKirsty Williams AM:Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. And I think that's a really important distinction to make. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. So, we do have a circumstance where\u2014and a process in place, to manage this. So, we have a specific designation policy, which is operated on our behalf by HEFCW. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. Three of those were further education colleges. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. All three of those are actual charities. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. And we are considering how that part of the sector will be regulated in the forthcoming legislation. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add?\nHuw Morris:Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM:At this stage\u2014\nSian Gwenllian AM:\u2014or are you still thinking about it?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation?\nKirsty Williams AM:I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. And there are a number of reasons for that. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, clearly, we'll need to keep that under review. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans?\nKirsty Williams AM:Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you, Minister. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thanks. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill?\nKirsty Williams AM:I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, Janet?\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis?\nKirsty Williams AM:If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight.\nDawn Bowden AM:I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure.\nHefin David AM:Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM:That's a very HEFCW thing to say.\nHefin David AM:\u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. I'd invite you to say whether you'd like to remedy that in future.\nKirsty Williams AM:I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out?\nHuw Morris:Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We would hope that's in the direction of the civic university approach that the Minister has outlined. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. When things go badly wrong, there are a range of mechanisms. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014\nHefin David AM:That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those.\nHuw Morris:So, in\u2014. Shall I carry on?\nKirsty Williams AM:Of course, yes.\nHuw Morris:In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. And potentially, in some of these other institutions, funding is linked to some of those things.\nKirsty Williams AM:And, of course, what always has to be\u2014. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. Dawn.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. So, the informal measures might not be as prevalent as they are currently, possibly.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do.\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. I wouldn't describe that as a minor matter.\nDawn Bowden AM:No. That's fair enough. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising?\nKirsty Williams AM:I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution. But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Hefin David has some questions now on fee and access plans.\nHefin David AM:Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans?\nKirsty Williams AM:I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation.\nHefin David AM:So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, I think there's an opportunity there to look to restructure. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. Can we do them differently to make them more effective? Yes, I think we can.\nHefin David AM:So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. I think it's still\u2014. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements.\nHefin David AM:No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. There's a real problem there. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused.\nKirsty Williams AM:That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better.\nHefin David AM:So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others?\nKirsty Williams AM:On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular?\nHefin David AM:I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion?\nKirsty Williams AM:Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014\nHefin David AM:I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. That's the message I've received. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received.\nHuw Morris:If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014\nHefin David AM:Because that happens at Stage 1.\nHuw Morris:Indeed, yes.\nHefin David AM:Okay. Sorry, can I move on to the next item?\nLynne Neagle AM:Oh, you're going on to the next section.\nHefin David AM:Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014\nLynne Neagle AM:Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame?\nKirsty Williams AM:As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Sorry, Hefin\u2014carry on.\nHefin David AM:I'll move on to managing risk, if that's okay. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance?\nKirsty Williams AM:I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions.\nHefin David AM:Okay. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM:No, no, I'm not disagreeing. My view is: I believe that the Act has struck that proportionality. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself.\nHefin David AM:So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated.\nHuw Morris:Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. So, I think we need to be careful in focusing on the inherent quality of things. We've made charitable status a key reference point in the operation of things at the moment. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily.\nHefin David AM:But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales.\nKirsty Williams AM:So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. If there were concerns about the quality of that provision, that course could be deregulated.\nHefin David AM:And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped?\nKirsty Williams AM:I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof.\nHefin David AM:Okay. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Dawn.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014\nDawn Bowden AM:Is that the risk review process in\u2014?\nKirsty Williams AM:That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be.\nDawn Bowden AM:So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think?\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward.\nDawn Bowden AM:But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged?\nHuw Morris:One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland?\nKirsty Williams AM:As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now from Si\u00e2n on quality assurance.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. That sounds to me\u00a0like some kind of an anomaly or an unintended consequence of the Act. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance?\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. Huw.\nHuw Morris:I would completely agree with what the Minister has said.\nKirsty Williams AM:As always. [Laughter.] At least in public, Huw.\nHuw Morris:There is the expectation that they will work together in concert. There's a lot of joint operation. I think, going forward, we would expect that to continue. We're looking to the new Bill to try to make that clearer. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years.\nSian Gwenllian AM:So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that?\nKirsty Williams AM:Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. No concerns about it, certainly from further education colleges.\nHuw Morris:There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. But, I'm not aware of any dissatisfaction.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice?\nKirsty Williams AM:I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. And by an extension of that, it would be compatible with current UK-wide baseline standards. So, we don't want to create specific problems for the HE sector in Wales.\nSian Gwenllian AM:But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us:\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. Huw.\nHuw Morris:I agree, obviously. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. That's an issue not just in Wales. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And finally, therefore, looking at overseas providers. Currently, of course, universities can award their degrees to students being taught by providers overseas. We know this created problems for the University of Wales in 2011. They faced a scandal; that's probably the best word to use there. Will the new Bill address these issues?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE?\nHuw Morris:Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. We've had conversations with both in the recent past. There is quality assurance of offshore activity through the QAA. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities.\nSian Gwenllian AM:So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this.\nHuw Morris:The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. I don't think we're currently looking to mandate the detail of how that should happen. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. I think we would look to that as a primary mechanism.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning.\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Item 3 then is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. This is the letter that we agreed we would send last week. Can I ask Members if they're happy to note those? Yes. Thank you very much. Item 4 then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you.\n",
        "summary": "The meeting between the Children, Young People and Education Committee and the Welsh Government was considered as a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. To start with, Kirsty Williams AM suggested although the Bill was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, it was still valuable to discuss in the current context. The Act had partly fulfilled the Government's objectives in regulating institutions, safeguarding contribution, managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. Kirsty Williams AM also pointed out that new methods should be included to further regulate, co-ordinating and fund the sector. When it comes to the future of the Act, the meeting agreed that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of the civic mission, and students' interests must be fully preserved. Meanwhile, some participants argued that HEFCW's powers were inflexible and fee plans from private providers were hard to regulate. Kirsty Williams AM agreed that a more flexible connection between the regulating sectors and the others should be attained. Besides, the meeting also talked about managing risk and agreed that the Act, in the future should include more alternative providers for students who were receiving long-term support. In the end, Kirsty Williams AM praised the contribution from overseas providers in supporting transnational education in Wales and agreed that rights of students in Wales should always be put in the first place.",

Okay , so we've got uh so we've got new project requirements . Um . So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to uh {disfmarker} for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . Um . Three presentations .\nIndustrial Designer:We have a {disfmarker} I guess we have a presentation each , 'cause I've got one . Um .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:I see , right .\nMarketing:I've got one too .\nProject Manager:That's nice to know , one from each of you . Um new project requirements . Um so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to um {disfmarker} W I I got um {gap} or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . We discussed that last time\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled {vocalsound} in a sense .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Um we've got uh teletext outdated . Um did you get any information on that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh we didn't , no .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing .\nIndustrial Designer:I d I didn't personally .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:So I I got that in email form .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um . Right okay . So I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay that's fine . I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one .\nProject Manager:Sorry , yep .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What is it ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not quite sure how it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think you've got to do um control F_ eight .\nIndustrial Designer:Control {gap} {disfmarker} Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment .\nUser Interface:Shift F_ eight . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Alt function F_ eight . {vocalsound} Again not doing anything .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} There's usually a little thing in the top right for the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nUser Interface:Ah there ,\nMarketing:Oh hang on ,\nUser Interface:it's doing something .\nMarketing:it's just coming on .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} pressed about five times now .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , that's me {gap} . Okay , um I have to go {gap} again .\nProject Manager:{gap} it going ?\nIndustrial Designer:Hopefully that should be it this time . Okay , I think we're there . That's good . Okay , um {disfmarker} Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . Um {vocalsound} of the of the remote control . Um I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television . {gap} . Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , so . I'll just go through there . S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? Oh I'll j\nProject Manager:Uh there's the rubber on the right , I think .\nUser Interface:I think it's that little {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh I see . Oh okay . I'll get rid of the bear.$\nProject Manager:{gap} it's magic . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay that's great . Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no , a power supply which we'd probably get {disfmarker} it's probably gonna be the battery . Um we then have a particular button , which may be {disfmarker} {gap} that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . Um but this is how the basic system works . Um that sends {gap} after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which um then sends {disfmarker} It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . {vocalsound} Um . So that's {gap} . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . So this is the uh user interface . Um this is the chip itself , which then {gap} , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . And the sender sends a message to the receiver . 'Kay .\nProject Manager:So the the top bit's the power source , yes ? {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah yes , that's the power source . Um . {gap} going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . Um and then the sender ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . You don't have to be point directly at the television itself .\nProject Manager:So the battery is the {disfmarker} in the sender .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker} Yes . 'Kay and that's it for the moment .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . So , now more design . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Right . Thank you . Mine's not quite as complicated as all that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's what we like to hear . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Did I press function ? Yeah .\nProject Manager:Is it control function ei Oh , th there you go .\nUser Interface:Oh . Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . {vocalsound} Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . Um here are two example remotes . Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . So , {vocalsound} it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . Um they're nice , kinda clearly labelled . Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . So it's very very user friendly , and it's got a little splash of colour . Could maybe do with some more colour . Um .\nProject Manager:Well there's a couple of things there . Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product .\nUser Interface:Hmm . Do we get to see that ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I haven't as yet , no .\nUser Interface:Will you be presenting that in a bit ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . So uh I'm guessing that uh uh I notice on the bottom there it's got uh what's that ? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . Possibly ?\nUser Interface:What do you mean by the circular section ?\nIndustrial Designer:J yeah yeah yeah j yeah\nUser Interface:Like all of that bottom bit ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:just this little bit is that {disfmarker} I think that's still um a video remote part ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so maybe we could get rid of that as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And I don't really think that you need nine numbers .\nProject Manager:Well b uh w\nUser Interface:I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .\nProject Manager:Well th the on the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Like how often do you hit nine ?\nProject Manager:Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . But but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might think it's {disfmarker} {gap}\nProject Manager:But , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh I mean {vocalsound} how many channels do we have to um {disfmarker} actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? I would have thought that uh {gap} it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got {disfmarker} although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'cause you have to be able to stop it . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting {disfmarker} rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and that would cut down your time .\nUser Interface:Mm . Um .\nProject Manager:Anyway .\nUser Interface:But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yeah .\nUser Interface:Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Whatever .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Limit the number of buttons , user friendly .\nUser Interface:But I suppose nine's not really excessive .\nIndustrial Designer:I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you {disfmarker} uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number .\nUser Interface:I suppose it does make a good pattern .\nIndustrial Designer:So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah Well that's true , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:Does .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So w so what was the circular thing that you were {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . Um I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all .\nIndustrial Designer:So we could get it down to what ?\nProject Manager:If it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So we get to {disfmarker} How many buttons have we got ? We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . I guess .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um which isn't really too many . That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market {vocalsound} was one of the considerations .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:I'm {disfmarker} I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:or was I meant to give you that information ?\nMarketing:Um I'm not sure . I had I've had some market information ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:but not from the company , no .\nProject Manager:Right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:We've only got about another four hours left . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , so is everyone happy with that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Ah yes yes , that seems good .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Right well that's the end of my presentation .\nMarketing:'Kay . I'm gonna pull this off . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think she said twenty seconds to um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm sure we'll have by the end of today .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} I'll give it another go . Yeah , there we go . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it ? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age {disfmarker} forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . {vocalsound} Okay , so {disfmarker} My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some {vocalsound} sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech {disfmarker} A design which looks high-tech , basically . Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . That's worth thinking about . Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to {vocalsound} speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay um , and that's the end of the slide show . That's it . Cool .\nProject Manager:What was that last wee bit there ?\nUser Interface:Do {gap} a lot of um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um about speech recognition ?\nProject Manager:Speech recognition ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .\nMarketing:Youn young people pref Yeah , they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so .\nIndustrial Designer:No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um .\nProject Manager:Well that's right .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have {disfmarker} You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can {disfmarker} {gap} some kind of buzzer system between the two . So you can press a button which is always kept in one place\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .\nMarketing:Uh-huh . Yeah . Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well ,\nIndustrial Designer:That is true , yes .\nMarketing:which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Sounds reasonable .\nUser Interface:That'd probably be really simple ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:they're cheap .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the {disfmarker} or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote .\nProject Manager:Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . But if you {disfmarker} I know . Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . {vocalsound} You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} you could have an option to turn it off . Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Perhaps , um .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So uh {vocalsound} Any sugges Well , any conclusions ?\nMarketing:Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well if it does then we can't .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Considering {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's that simple ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had {disfmarker} The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for {disfmarker} because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . So that means that uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick\nIndustrial Designer:Has to be simple enough to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:because time to market is is critical . S\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . Um .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It would . But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} and if {disfmarker} and we've gotta get to the end . Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} Right okay , uh so I need to {disfmarker} Right . So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time . But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions\nMarketing:About five minutes .\nProject Manager:and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:We'll also know w when the next meeting is\nIndustrial Designer:Um . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I um {disfmarker} so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . Does that make reasonable sense ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes that seems right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Do it via the email\nMarketing:Okay . Yep .\nProject Manager:so that rather than coming you know {disfmarker} If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh {disfmarker} on what they come up with {vocalsound} effectively at the next meeting .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Right , is there {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S\nProject Manager:I would guess so .\nUser Interface:Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it .\nMarketing:Yeah and {disfmarker} Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I don't really know about the voice recognition thing .\nProject Manager:I {vocalsound} w well uh i\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment ,\nProject Manager:Something simple . Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short ,\nIndustrial Designer:and if something comes back {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:something that's quick and simple . So ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:sounds good .\nUser Interface:And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology .\nProject Manager:Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:On the basis that if we've got {disfmarker} if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:now something that doesn't like whis uh\nMarketing:No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well I I I don't know . Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but if {disfmarker} I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle ,\nMarketing:No ,\nIndustrial Designer:I'd go more {disfmarker}\nMarketing:clapping , I think clapping ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , f more for clap .\nMarketing:yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:so uh so clap option .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ?\nProject Manager:Uh . Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying ,\nUser Interface:Is that one of the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext ,\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so so take out teletext .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Taking out teletext , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think so , so zero to nine .\nMarketing:Mm . I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , ten numbers\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and then some kind of device to allow uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or multiple digits .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Did we decide anything about um the other functions ? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? You had an had an idea about the menu ?\nMarketing:Uh {vocalsound} we could possibly put an L_ {disfmarker} a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But just thinking um people probably {disfmarker} I mean you don't have {disfmarker} you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . You can't really avoid that .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic\nIndustrial Designer:So that'll be in {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:and if it is at the moment , that's fine . But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it {disfmarker} uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:and the idea is to have an international market\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:which is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech .\nMarketing:Yeah . I s I suppose um if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote\nProject Manager:Possibly .\nMarketing:'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so .\nProject Manager:That's right .\nMarketing:I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So how would this menu function work ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:like the volume or something .\nMarketing:that would be a good idea , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . My dad was watching a film the other week\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {gap} we're gonna have the the individual numbers\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide {disfmarker} Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu {gap} use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work .\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker} I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one {disfmarker} the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right , okay um .\nMarketing:So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you're basically pressing {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay , well .\nUser Interface:Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So y Ah That's a very good idea .\nUser Interface:So you don't use it that much , you don't have to see it all the time . But it's all there if you need it .\nIndustrial Designer:That is that is a good idea actually .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Sor sort of a second .\nProject Manager:So you keep um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Like a hidden panel .\nProject Manager:Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . I don't know if you've got the same .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Uh not quite , but I guess {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay . So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back .\nIndustrial Designer:Keep the other buttons but hide them away .\nUser Interface:Hmm . And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu ,\nProject Manager:Ah .\nUser Interface:but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So um {vocalsound} we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's right .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap} data functions hidden at back . Can bring out when needed .\nMarketing:So th the {disfmarker} The detailed ones would be sort of brightness ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:uh sorta {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . We have to decide .\nIndustrial Designer:So sh Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I guess so .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So on front ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} about the number {gap} .\nProject Manager:numbers ,\nIndustrial Designer:Um the volume up and down .\nUser Interface:And the volume ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} volume .\nIndustrial Designer:Shall we have a mute button as well ?\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:A mute button as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah I think they're handy .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . And probably a power one as well . {vocalsound} Dunno .\nUser Interface:I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity {gap} . Have you seen the adverts ? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby .\nIndustrial Designer:But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ?\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh-oh danger sign .\nIndustrial Designer:I think you probably should .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , but a little bit smaller .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Compromise .\nProject Manager:Well {vocalsound} {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ?\nMarketing:Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so we'll have um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ?\nProject Manager:Channel up and down .\nMarketing:Um .\nProject Manager:What else have we got ? What was that , sixteen ?\nMarketing:Numbers is ten , volume is twelve ,\nProject Manager:Volume button . How many volumes ?\nMarketing:th Yeah si One up , one down .\nProject Manager:Right okay .\nUser Interface:On mute .\nMarketing:And a mute , yeah . That's sixteen isn't it , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Is there anything else ? Um .\nMarketing:I don't think so , no .\nProject Manager:Power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . So is that it ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:{gap} so .\nProject Manager:Okay . That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . And then at the back ?\nMarketing:You've got brightness and contrast .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be .\nUser Interface:And then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . So on the back it'll have brightness , contrast ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:anything else ? You're also gonna have the channel tuner {gap} , as it were .\nUser Interface:Uh there's audio functions .\nIndustrial Designer:So tuner up and down , I guess .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Tuner , would that have up and down ? {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Um up {disfmarker} Tune one way , tune the o\nUser Interface:I think they normally do .\nProject Manager:{gap} okay {gap} . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I I dunno I dunno possibly .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select . Yeah , okay . Um I guess we're keeping s it simple . We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up , volume down .\nProject Manager:Um up volume , yeah , I would have thought so .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Do they have their own {disfmarker} do they have their own controls on their actual products , then ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um maybe for the younger market .\nIndustrial Designer:or do you have to do it via the remote ?\nUser Interface:Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I suppose if we've got their {disfmarker} if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Oh no , I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , okay . Right .\nUser Interface:But I don't really know what they're for ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I've never used them .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nUser Interface:I just know they're something to do with Dolby .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well you might get some research . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well shall we look into that and just get back together .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:And we'll meet back at I'm not sure . Um forty minutes , I believe is the time .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Come on .\n",
        "summary": "The Project Manager gave a brief review of the team's last meeting, then Industrial Designer, User Interface and Marketing gave their presentation each. Industrial Designer's presentation is about the components and system of the remote control. User Interface gave the presentation about the design of the remote. The team agreed that there should be 17 buttons on the front of the remote and two on the back. Marketing's presentation is about the research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control. The team agreed that they could add a clap-back function to the remote.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay . Um welcome to our second meeting . This is the functional design meeting . And I hope you all had a good individual working time . Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . And then we're gonna close up the meeting . And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . {gap} Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of {disfmarker} 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay . Oh , well let's go ahead and ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} back , previous .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . Who would like to start us off ? 'Kay .\nUser Interface:I don't mind going first .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's in the {disfmarker} should be in the m Project .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You know you could you could do it yourself actually .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Did you send it ?\nProject Manager:Save it in the project documents .\nUser Interface:Put it in Project Documents ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-mm-mm . This one ?\nUser Interface:Sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Great .\nUser Interface:Okay . Um well , the function {vocalsound} of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . {vocalsound} And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:And we can decide if that's what we want , {gap} , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is {disfmarker} fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . Okay .\nProject Manager:Ready .\nUser Interface:And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:So that's it .\nProject Manager:Alright . Very good presentation . Thank you . You speak with such authority on the matter .\nUser Interface:Mm . Left .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Who would like to um follow that one up ? Now , that we've discussed {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I can go .\nProject Manager:Okay . Do you want me to run it or you wanna {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , you should run it .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Functional requirements .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm yes .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .\nMarketing:Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the {vocalsound} users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Seventy five percent think they're ugly . Eighty percent want {disfmarker} they've {disfmarker} are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they {disfmarker} it needs to be snazzy and it {disfmarker} but yet simple .\nUser Interface:{gap} Wait .\nMarketing:So that's really what we need to do . And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And that meaning what ?\nMarketing:Like {disfmarker} They like I guess use the buttons a lot .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:I don't know . It's from my uh research .\nProject Manager:Okay , what do you m\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:My team wasn't very clear .\nProject Manager:Oh , I'm sorry .\nUser Interface:Only use ten percent of the buttons .\nProject Manager:What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's okay . I I think it's like the engineering versus user ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex\nProject Manager:Oh , right .\nMarketing:and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .\nProject Manager:The buttons . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:We only use ten per cent of our brains . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Good point .\nProject Manager:It works .\nMarketing:It's a necessary evil .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Ready for the next slide ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:much like any small appliance like a cellphone ,\nUser Interface:Lost .\nMarketing:and they {disfmarker} we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go {disfmarker} we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote ,\nUser Interface:S\nMarketing:but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .\nProject Manager:It's okay . It's very important . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yes , it is important for the remote control world .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Wait , is that like your {disfmarker} ergonomics like your hand movements or something ?\nMarketing:Sh\nProject Manager:Could be , yeah .\nMarketing:Uh possibly .\nIndustrial Designer:Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?\nUser Interface:Like {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nMarketing:Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I\nUser Interface:Channel , volume , power .\nProject Manager:I think that's a pretty good guess though .\nMarketing:don't know .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , I would assume so .\nUser Interface:It's like if you're holding it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It's okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones .\nProject Manager:Okay . Next slide ?\nMarketing:Yes . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .\nProject Manager:User-friendly .\nMarketing:Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in {disfmarker} like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:And also we found {disfmarker} our team found that speech recognition is {disfmarker} it's like an up-and-coming thing they really {disfmarker} consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it .\nProject Manager:And so just to {disfmarker} just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?\nMarketing:I guess so , yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{gap} to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh , that'd be lovely .\nMarketing:Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Didn't they {disfmarker} um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would {disfmarker} the remote would beep so if you have lost it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do .\nProject Manager:Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true .\nUser Interface:You know like go to the base .\nProject Manager:We could definitely include that if we wanted to .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:If it's within our price . Okay . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I'm just trying to move it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . I think it should be there , working design .\nUser Interface:Working design .\nProject Manager:There we go .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .\nProject Manager:Oh my bad . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh that's fine .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this .\nUser Interface:Help me .\nIndustrial Designer:We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What exactly is a smart chip ?\nIndustrial Designer:Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .\nUser Interface:Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ?\nIndustrial Designer:I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . Ready ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um yep , nothing here .\nProject Manager:That's okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Um a large on-off button , {vocalsound} demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . Um smart chip that perverts {disfmarker} uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh this is my fifty second design .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .\nMarketing:So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?\nIndustrial Designer:This is just like a rough schematic .\nProject Manager:So this would be the front ?\nIndustrial Designer:So this is the internal workings .\nProject Manager:So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ?\nMarketing:Oh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .\nProject Manager:The l {vocalsound} the light up kind of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red ,\nMarketing:Like that we know the battery's working .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ?\nProject Manager:Hmm . It'd probably be lighting up the key too ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:We can skip that whole thing .\nProject Manager:right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So you can put it in the dark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The buttons .\nMarketing:Yeah , and that's good .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:We should make it glow in the dark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , definitely . 'Kay nex R Ready ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's it .\nProject Manager:'Kay , any p 'Kay ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons .\nUser Interface:Just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?\nMarketing:I think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in {disfmarker} like in {disfmarker} for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .\nUser Interface:Ovals . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay , let's talk about all of our {disfmarker} We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and {vocalsound} I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . {vocalsound} Wait , come back . Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:It's not gonna be multi-functional .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . We're trying to get our name out there in the world . Okay .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:And you know what teletext is ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap} in States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports ,\nUser Interface:I know .\nMarketing:What is it ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen ,\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:not even {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it's like black , black and white kind of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , just black with just text .\nMarketing:Like running along the bottom ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It'll give you the sports .\nMarketing:Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?\nProject Manager:Kind of .\nUser Interface:Except the entire screen .\nProject Manager:Yeah it's the whole screen .\nIndustrial Designer:It's the entire screen is just running information at random .\nProject Manager:So anyway {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment ,\nIndustrial Designer:Seemingly .\nUser Interface:you know it's like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ?\nProject Manager:Right . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , {vocalsound} and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so {disfmarker} Those are our new product requirements . Alright . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So , do we have to include the company colour within that ?\nProject Manager:Yes . It's part of the logo . Okay .\nUser Interface:Company colour being yellow . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright . {gap} Whatever . Okay . So our target group is {disfmarker} You mentioned um older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's gonna make it nicer . Yeah .\nProject Manager:non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons .\nProject Manager:Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ?\nMarketing:No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think .\nIndustrial Designer:Most of them will intuitively pick it up though .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network .\nProject Manager:Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , I think we need it all .\nProject Manager:Um what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:We should go for the lowest denominator .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right , okay . So so they need no technical experience to operate {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:High school educated .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no .\nProject Manager:Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes .\nUser Interface:Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , volume .\nMarketing:And channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones .\nProject Manager:Right . And we wanna keep um {disfmarker} I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Hey , what else ?\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think so . What do you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sure , yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:A finding kind of device or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And\nMarketing:I need {disfmarker} we we need a like homing device .\nProject Manager:Yeah , ho homing device . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?\nUser Interface:Oh right yeah okay .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:Tracking .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .\nUser Interface:But you got a base .\nMarketing:Do you think people'll really go for that though ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's useful for the remote phone .\nMarketing:Because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?\nMarketing:I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . I I think we can make a decision about that later . Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . So that would include battery source {disfmarker} Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Well , then we could {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Do w\nUser Interface:If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge\nProject Manager:You could um {disfmarker} we could hook it up .\nMarketing:It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black ,\nProject Manager:Oh .\nMarketing:but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So {vocalsound} basically older people don't really care .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:just sitcoms and stuff . Right .\nUser Interface:Well , then then do you put the voice recognition {disfmarker} do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote ,\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {gap} and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:A certain phrase then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Still {gap} fifteen minutes .\nProject Manager:Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ?\nUser Interface:Um . Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ?\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:Wait , on the remote itself ?\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero .\nProject Manager:How how ,\nMarketing:Well , we definitely need those .\nProject Manager:yeah , how would you leave those out ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can {gap} like well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Unless you could say the channel .\nUser Interface:I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think people would find that too foreign .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's true .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too .\nMarketing:You definitely need {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . {vocalsound} So I couldn't {disfmarker} whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:It's when we get satellite .\nProject Manager:Mm . {gap} get your own remote , or digital cable .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Um . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .\nUser Interface:The colour being yellow ?\nMarketing:Wait .\nProject Manager:I'm guessing . And the R_R_ .\nUser Interface:And how do we {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish .\nIndustrial Designer:R_ the double R_ .\nProject Manager:We could just have the logo in yellow ,\nUser Interface:Can't make it entirely {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or maybe a yellow light for the keys .\nIndustrial Designer:Or is the l\nMarketing:Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , {vocalsound} yellow could be and it could {disfmarker} doesn't have to be huge .\nUser Interface:Well if you have like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Hang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom {gap} the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .\nProject Manager:Right . So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,\nUser Interface:Right , yeah .\nProject Manager:or no menu buttons .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um can we go back to {disfmarker} I'm gonna look really quickly back at those\nUser Interface:Two examples .\nProject Manager:examples and see if there is anything .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ?\nUser Interface:Oh , it's a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?\nProject Manager:The T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ?\nUser Interface:Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:and so it's like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , 'cause we need to {disfmarker} we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful .\nProject Manager:Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language ,\nUser Interface:I don't {disfmarker} well , I don't know .\nProject Manager:you know ?\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons .\nProject Manager:For the menus .\nUser Interface:Well , that could be {disfmarker} No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That's true .\nUser Interface:Channel is just up and down .\nMarketing:Yeah , okay . Okay , yeah .\nUser Interface:And then add a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Something that looks mayb you know .\nMarketing:Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one .\nProject Manager:Y right , right right right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That one ?\nUser Interface:So we just have it like {disfmarker} add a menu button then for the various things needed ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now\nProject Manager:In the middle perhaps .\nUser Interface:included in the menu .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:Ooh , I just got an idea for a design .\nProject Manager:{gap} good . Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ?\nIndustrial Designer:I had something , but I forgot .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . {gap} get out of here . Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm . Alright . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . And then we're gonna have lunch break . And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . Um I'm gonna put the minutes {disfmarker} I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . 'Kay . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? No ? Okay , well , this meeting is officially over . Thank you all .\n",
        "summary": "This was the functional design meeting, where the team discussed what functions should be included in the remote and how they should be carried out. User Interface gave a presentation on the design of the remote, offering a complex version and a simple one. Marketing followed with a presentation on the functional requirements of the remote, pointing out that the remote should be both high-tech looking and user-friendly, preferably with fewer buttons, a lost-and-found function and speech recognition. Industrial Designer then presented the working design for the remote, including its power source, chips and the component layout. The team then went into a further in-depth discussion, dealing with the specific points raised in the above presentations. After everyone had shared their ideas, Project Manager closed the meeting by distributing new tasks among the team members for them to work on until their next meeting.",

So um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:By Big Brother ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:This uh {disfmarker} These are cameras , so are these . This thing uh that looks like a pie ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:are actually all microphones .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:So you must be careful with uh with uh all this . And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be . And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras .\nMarketing:Of our faces .\nProject Manager:And {disfmarker} Indeed . So they can see our faces .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Welcome at the kick-off meeting . My name is uh Danny Wolfs . {vocalsound} Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . {vocalsound} Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ?\nUser Interface:I'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer .\nProject Manager:User interface , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Hi , my name's uh {gap} . I'm the Industrial Designer .\nProject Manager:Industrial , yes .\nMarketing:I'm uh Tim {gap} . Um my function is the Marketing Expert .\nProject Manager:Okay , thank you . First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ? {vocalsound} And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of {disfmarker} If it's uh it's possible technical-wise .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh each stage is uh {vocalsound} uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward . {vocalsound} Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . {vocalsound} This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . {vocalsound} This is called a smart board\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Speaks for itself .\nProject Manager:thing uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} This uh is {gap} very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:because I think you know uh how it works . Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh little uh little {vocalsound} kinda exercise to uh know each other .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . Uh important is that we use different colours , {vocalsound} and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths .\nMarketing:I have a question .\nProject Manager:Yes ?\nMarketing:Um this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:or uh did you just make it up yourself ?\nProject Manager:No no no . It's uh it's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I I I must do it .\nMarketing:It's part of the introduction ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , yeah . 'Cause we uh really don't know each other ,\nMarketing:okay .\nProject Manager:and uh it's kinda new . So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That kind of thing . Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ?\nMarketing:Um , yeah . I don't know really how it works . But maybe you can show us first ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , okay . Yeah , okay . Drawing goes with uh this thing . Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . That's uh important .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So hold it uh like this .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:You g you get electrocuted or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , kinda . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} You must p p uh push a little uh {disfmarker} Good . Because {disfmarker} And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . It's not uh fully real-time , so uh watch it .\nUser Interface:Ach . {gap}\nProject Manager:Oh yeah . Well I'm gonna paint in the red .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:Ooph .\nProject Manager:That's the background colour . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , undo . Um {disfmarker} The pen ? No . One minute please . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's the one . Well , five . Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} My favourite animal huh ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's like Pictionary ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , you can guess what it is .\nMarketing:The the one who says it first {vocalsound} gets a raise .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} May uh paint uh next .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's a pork ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No , it's not an orc . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You don't see it uh at the ears ?\nMarketing:Mm yeah , I have it at home . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You have an orc at home ?\nUser Interface:Very artistic .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Thank you .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So it's a cat . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:What's it called ?\nProject Manager:Simba . 'Cause uh we have a cat at home\nMarketing:Ah .\nProject Manager:and he's called Simba . 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Miniature size ?\nProject Manager:So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:He's happy with us , so uh he's smiling .\nUser Interface:Wow . He does have body uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Huh .\nProject Manager:No , only the face . Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . So we uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . We have to speed up .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , who wants to go next ?\nMarketing:I {disfmarker} Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing .\nMarketing:Save it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You have to save it .\nProject Manager:Save it , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I've done it . New ? 'Kay .\nUser Interface:You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm uh {disfmarker} Not really .\nProject Manager:Kind of firm touch .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That one .\nUser Interface:Oh . Uh hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah ? Okay . Open . Which one is it ? Smart board ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . And now ? Okay . Okay , thanks . 'Kay , I've speed up . 'Kay , that's fine . Line width .\nIndustrial Designer:By the way , why was your cat uh red ?\nProject Manager:Because uh my cat is red uh at home .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And I have red hair , so uh must be red .\nUser Interface:It's a very bloody cat .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh , yeah , sure .\nUser Interface:It's a frog . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No , it's a turtle . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh it's an apple . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's not an apple .\nIndustrial Designer:Must be a dog . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A dog ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Hmm . Colour . {vocalsound} Something like this . Smaller .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Huh ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh , it is a turtle .\nProject Manager:It is a turtle . Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ?\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker} 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You watched it a lot ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh ?\nProject Manager:You watched it a lot ?\nUser Interface:It's uh inside its shell . You'll be uh finished sooner .\nMarketing:No , it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's a scared turtle .\nMarketing:No no . {vocalsound} It's coming up . Mm . Uh .\nUser Interface:Wow .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , Tim . Thank you . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Something like this . {vocalsound} Okay , you know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Very artistic .\nProject Manager:Jurgen , you want to go next ?\nUser Interface:Yes {gap} . Okay . Wha Thank you .\nMarketing:Yeah ? Here you go .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:How did it work ?\nProject Manager:Format ? And then you have the the current colour ,\nUser Interface:Performance ?\nProject Manager:you can change . So no red or green .\nUser Interface:And a pen ?\nProject Manager:And uh line uh width . I had five .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Tim had {disfmarker} Uh Tim , what kinda line width did you have ?\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh the big lines were like nine .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . It's a dog .\nUser Interface:Well , very good . {vocalsound} I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh .\nProject Manager:Okay . Why a dog ? You have a dog at home ?\nUser Interface:Well , we had a dog , a few years ago .\nProject Manager:Had a dog ?\nMarketing:Uh , it's p\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:And and it , {gap} yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something .\nProject Manager:Ah .\nUser Interface:But uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's pretty good uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You have an artistic uh inner middle .\nMarketing:{gap} {vocalsound} An artist .\nProject Manager:{gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh a Graphical User Designer , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Hey .\nMarketing:Think you uh picked the wrong uh function . Wrong job .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No . Can work together . Ah colour .\nProject Manager:So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . Not difficult at all .\nMarketing:Wha\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well ,\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nUser Interface:it's okay {gap} .\nProject Manager:thank you . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's enough ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:thanks . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Janus ? The last one ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , sure .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh thanks .\nMarketing:I wonder .\nProject Manager:Yeah . After a cat , a turtle and a dog .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think he's gonna draw an elephant . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I figure I should do something like that ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but I'm gonna do something much more difficult .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-oh .\nUser Interface:Uh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic {gap} design .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'm gonna design a remote uh {vocalsound} remote control animal . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Remote control animal .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Exactly . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sorry .\nUser Interface:Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:That that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:I think it's easier to draw .\nProject Manager:Better to draw with a with {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse .\nUser Interface:Than on the , with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mouth . Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But what is he uh ?\nUser Interface:Too expensive , yeah .\nProject Manager:Is it a rabbit ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do you have a rabbit at home ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A green rabbit .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , exactly . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , then yeah .\nUser Interface:There , the g white green rabbit .\nIndustrial Designer:So .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} He's a little bit stoned there . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .\nMarketing:Yeah . It will do .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh uh {disfmarker} Uh well .\nProject Manager:Okay . Finishing touch and then we're going further .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Project Manager ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:Where does the pen go ? Just uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Have you been uh counting the time ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , a little . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . Let's go on then .\nProject Manager:Well , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Don't choose for youself .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh , sorry . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's selfish . Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff .\nMarketing:It's pretty abstract .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . So that's a lot . We have to sell uh a lot of uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , how much is it ?\nMarketing:Like how much ?\nUser Interface:Hundred million uh remotes or something ?\nProject Manager:Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes .\nUser Interface:Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Twenty million . Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah .\nProject Manager:But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table . {vocalsound} Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ?\nUser Interface:Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and {disfmarker} Or just only {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ?\nProject Manager:If you have them on uh {disfmarker} I can uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah , I can find {disfmarker} Uh .\nProject Manager:Okay . Oh , in case you want it {disfmarker} This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Screen ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , be The screens .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No no no . Only {disfmarker} All the drawings go there , at the left uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface:Uh but um which {disfmarker} The ones we made on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there .\nUser Interface:Oh , only in Word ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:okay .\nMarketing:Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay . Five minutes .\nMarketing:Five minutes ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um {vocalsound} think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um {disfmarker} And something like an L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface:For what purpose ?\nMarketing:Um uh like I said here um {disfmarker} Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , {vocalsound} when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh\nMarketing:From my point of view , yeah .\nProject Manager:remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ?\nMarketing:Yeah , it has to be uh {disfmarker} Yeah , our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So yeah , I I agree with you .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So i i i i\nProject Manager:So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:To the current market .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Look , {vocalsound} you got some cheap uh remote controls there . They just uh {disfmarker} Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:But when you enter a new market with a remote control and\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:uh wanna gain market share\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:you have to do something special , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But we have to keep an eye that it's {disfmarker} Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , of course .\nUser Interface:And and the price . {gap}\nMarketing:But it's {disfmarker} But but this is just from marketing uh aspect .\nProject Manager:Yeah okay . Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:I don't know anything about user interface or {vocalsound} design .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap} And that's because we have him . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And and him . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And him . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um {vocalsound} the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . {vocalsound} Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So that's the thing we uh discussed .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Um one thing uh ,\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we {disfmarker} Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh {disfmarker} We should have some agreement on that before we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . Um wha\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually .\nMarketing:I think th that's a pha Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:That's a phase further .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Ju just uh make some mock-ups , some some general ideas .\nUser Interface:Ah okay .\nMarketing:And and then we can plan {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:We can plan further , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh {disfmarker} How do you call it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Consensus on the , what we're gonna do .\nProject Manager:Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Uh I think that's well uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Will come in handy .\nMarketing:Mm yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't know . You decide . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:You're the Project Manager .\nProject Manager:W {vocalsound} He says {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Or do we use it a text screen ? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh {vocalsound} is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Uh tha that's a same step further .\nProject Manager:Why ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , actually it is .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Why ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Then looking at individual components ,\nMarketing:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:so that's actually a f step further .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , we can take it from there .\nMarketing:w what it's gonna be .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there .\nMarketing:A And then you s then you can delete uh\nIndustrial Designer:Or edit .\nMarketing:the o the obsolete uh details .\nProject Manager:Okay . So uh\nMarketing:I think .\nProject Manager:each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I must finish off now ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so it's over . You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . And I see you in uh thirty minutes . Thank you .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , cheers .\nUser Interface:Sorry .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Be careful .\nMarketing:Damn .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Success ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . No . Come up .\n",
        "summary": "Project Manager gave a brief introduction of the new remote control project for television sets. During team building, team members got to know each other by drawing their favorite animals with technical devices. When it came to the financial targets, Project Manager planned that the remote control would be priced at 25 Euros on the premise of the 12.5-Euro production cost, and the profit is targeted at 50 million Euros. The market range would be international. Then, ideas about new technical features of the remote control were proposed, such as radio waves and bluetooth, in order to distinguish the product from current ones. Finally, some general arrangements for the next meeting about user requirements and technical functions were made by Project Manager and each team member was required to think on the most important thing from their own point of view.",

Mm mm mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Not too many cables and stuff .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Original . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Is recorded ? Okay ? Okay so welcome everyone . So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . So I will first start with a warm welcome opening {vocalsound} stuff ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be {disfmarker} you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so maybe you could hurry up a bit {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} sorry ?\nUser Interface:It's true . I have another meeting so if you could uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You have another meeting soon ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So you have to be quick .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , for the lawnmower project .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing {vocalsound} and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} What an original idea .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Orangutan .\nProject Manager:Okay {vocalsound} that's good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No no n\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} n n {gap}\nUser Interface:Can I give you the\nProject Manager:You should {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} no ? But I don't have to say anything . When I'm drawing the orangutan .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh {vocalsound} I'll let you uh comment .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan .\nProject Manager:Okay it's an abstract drawing .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:I think it's nice and original . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} You should write y the name I think . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I don't have a red colour . Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes .\nProject Manager:You want to draw something Christine ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay uh sorry . You have to imagine a little bit {vocalsound} um .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:This {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Sorry too {vocalsound} uh .\nUser Interface:Yes . I know .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Is this uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Wha what is this strange beast ?\nMarketing:Is it beautiful ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Is it a monster ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Do you know ? It's a cat .\nUser Interface:It's a cat ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Isn't it ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I thought these things did not exist .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes yes\nIndustrial Designer:Me {vocalsound}\nMarketing:is it {disfmarker} like that .\nUser Interface:Ah yeah {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Ah yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Is it better ?\nProject Manager:Ah okay it's pretty . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay it's your cat . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's my cat .\nUser Interface:Does have a name ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:The name is Caramel .\nUser Interface:Caramel . Ah-ha .\nIndustrial Designer:Caramel .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Olivier , do you want to {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And you {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think I'm too short for the cables . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm a bit short on cable .\nUser Interface:Next time I concentrate .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . So what could I draw ? {vocalsound} Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . {vocalsound} I don't know if it looks like a cow {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:He looks like a bong .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Like a what ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay . Sorry . No .\nIndustrial Designer:Quite squarey .\nUser Interface:Scary ?\nProject Manager:{gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:He also . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact {vocalsound} I would say .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I I think we will be finished this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control .\nUser Interface:Is it for uh for putting a {disfmarker} for logos , no .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Let's move on . So {disfmarker} Here the uh financial objective of our project . That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros .\nUser Interface:I is there a matter for a new remote control ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs .\nUser Interface:Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ?\nProject Manager:We have to discuss that point .\nUser Interface:Ah\nProject Manager:On {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:this is not defined at all ?\nProject Manager:yeah you you can suggest points like this . So what what {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ah , okay .\nProject Manager:so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . So what's {disfmarker} what are your ideas about that ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe I can have the {disfmarker} your opinion from the marketing side ?\nUser Interface:Well uh do we sell other stuff ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us .\nProject Manager:Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Do you agree ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So maybe it should be for multiple devices . And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:If we don't have so many buttons could be nice .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Few buttons . Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And do you have it also to be {disfmarker} to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? Might be a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend {disfmarker} the trend in domain , what it shouldn't {disfmarker} it should look like , or things like that ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:With rou okay . Like for {disfmarker} okay .\nUser Interface:Something like that , least fits in your hand .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The basic requirement .\nProject Manager:So . Fit in your hand , yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Only a buck .\nProject Manager:And also it have , i it may be {vocalsound} it may be important for the remote control to be uh {disfmarker} To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Waterproof . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Water-proof as well .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And I think we should have a device {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh {disfmarker} in your bath whereas the others can't .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe water-proof would be very original .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry . {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:That could be uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:B it seems uh so , but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f\nProject Manager:Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And , and that's one of the {disfmarker} that's one of the shock {disfmarker} I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .\nProject Manager:Yeah , mayb B\nUser Interface:That's people {gap} they actually do it themselves .\nProject Manager:But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {gap} directly .\nUser Interface:I it will look a bulky in that case .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That might be good uh track to follow .\nUser Interface:Like as an optional thing .\nProject Manager:Optional or selled with it ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .\nProject Manager:Maybe we can have uh {disfmarker} But we don't design the T_V_ .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Barks .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , barks , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Barks .\nProject Manager:So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah whistle .\nProject Manager:I don't know , whistle-able ? {vocalsound} Th\nIndustrial Designer:Whistle tracking . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's that's quite cool , but uh of course we {disfmarker} you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ?\nProject Manager:Yeah d d uh .\nUser Interface:So i it's just going to add t to the cost .\nProject Manager:Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to {vocalsound} have an advantage over our competitors . I think this is a good advantage .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's cool . I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . We have to ask {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:who is giving {disfmarker} who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Which is you .\nUser Interface:'Kay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay so try to find that for next meeting . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh . {vocalsound} Don't pani .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Don't panic . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working {disfmarker} any working function we have discussed .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And also um {vocalsound} I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . So . And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:So . Thank you I think that's all for this point .\nUser Interface:Good .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thank you {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh , so we come back in five minutes ? Half an hour .\nProject Manager:Anyway you will receive some messages . {vocalsound} Be careful . You eat it ? Does it move uh ? Okay , but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh {disfmarker} We'll see .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah . {gap}\n",
        "summary": "This meeting was primarily concerned with the design process and specific designing requirements of the remote control. Project Manager first introduced the goal of the new remote control project as to be original, trendy and user-friendly so as to bear an advantage over competitive products. Then three steps of the design process were respectively introduced and explained by Project Manager, and drawings of favourite animals then followed as an imagination-inspiring activity. According to Project Manager, the fifty-million-Euro financial objective of the project would be achieved at a production cost lower than 12.5 Euros and a twofold selling price. Competitiveness-endowing requirements for remote control design were then proposed and carefully discussed.",

I hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time . How t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . Okay , and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you . And it's in the , I think uh , in the sharing folder . And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . So can you go to the next slide ? Yeah uh the agenda of the meeting is opening . Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management , what I'm going to do , and uh , of course , I'm doing the project management and secretary both , okay , to take the minutes of the meeting . And there are three presentations . One is uh new project requirements . And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions . And uh finally we are closing . Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes , so you have to be very quick . And I have come up with the {disfmarker} management come with the new proposal , okay , and I have to discuss a few points on this . Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . And the second one is about uh the remote control . Should be used only for the T_V_ . That's what our uh management says . And the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product . Okay . {vocalsound} So I will invite uh {disfmarker} Agnes , can you go to the third slide ?\nUser Interface:No , this is the third slide .\nProject Manager:Okay , {gap} . So , I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay , do you wanna open the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Sure . Um . You're participant s\nIndustrial Designer:I'm number two .\nUser Interface:Two ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That's it .\nUser Interface:Do you want the mouse , or do you want me to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll do the notes . Yeah , thanks .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So um well I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from {vocalsound} research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point , you know .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Really have {disfmarker} It needs to be able y y have to be able to find it . Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . So uh , I also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as I said in the first meeting , um {vocalsound} and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . {vocalsound} I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic , which I kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off , that might be interesting . And um {vocalsound} so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get {disfmarker} would start off by the {disfmarker} you'd get {disfmarker} it would easily cause um problems . So , uh I {disfmarker} in addition to uh looking at the um {vocalsound} uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm {disfmarker} they {vocalsound} represent examples that are available today {vocalsound} {vocalsound} which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind .\nMarketing:Fantastic . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It'd be easy to find . And um it would uh y you'd {vocalsound} {disfmarker} you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . And since I'm not really um {vocalsound} Industrial Designer , I didn't really know what to do with this slide . But um {vocalsound} I just {vocalsound} took some {vocalsound} different uh schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . {gap} I don't know why um we were asked to do this . So , uh {vocalsound} personal preferences , {vocalsound} um\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . I think um it could either be {disfmarker} you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um {vocalsound} uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the {disfmarker} of the user's home . Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . Um {vocalsound} if you uh mi one of {disfmarker} one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery . {vocalsound} So ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:that's {disfmarker} those are my f preferences , and that's my presentation .\nProject Manager:Yeah , let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay , because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay , and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Run over it with a car .\nProject Manager:Yes . Okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , okay , I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , if I'm not wrong . Maybe you can uh add it in that .\nIndustrial Designer:Good idea . Good idea , I'll I'll uh um {disfmarker} Yes , very good .\nProject Manager:Okay , uh thank you Christine , and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ?\nUser Interface:Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? 'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder ,\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Titanium . Titanium would be {vocalsound} be heavy , too ,\nMarketing:Titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:wouldn't it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:No , I haven't really um {disfmarker} I wanted feedback , I think we need to rate {disfmarker} rank these , but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Sure , yeah . No , I just wondering whether {disfmarker} that you had any sort of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I like titanium . It's light .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {vocalsound} yeah\nMarketing:Expensive .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The marketing comes out . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but uh who who said {disfmarker} who said we were ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:you know , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Yeah the the {disfmarker} I'm sorry because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back {vocalsound} . I know the project plan and the budget . So I can close this , {gap} not sure . Was in uh {disfmarker} S This . So let me see where is this file .\nUser Interface:That's Christine's .\nProject Manager:This is Christine . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And that's mine , I think .\nProject Manager:That's yours , okay . Saving .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface:In modified .\nMarketing:I don't know ,\nProject Manager:Okay , uh\nMarketing:I think verbally we can {disfmarker} we can pretty much sell .\nProject Manager:I will {disfmarker} I will send you a mail , okay ? The project may be the the project aim , okay . At the end of the day , the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro . Okay , and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side . Okay , that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh {disfmarker} how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be {disfmarker} we sell in the market . Okay . Then uh you can come back with your feedback . And I I have one {disfmarker} maybe the suggestion or opinion . This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ . Okay , and it will be slim , okay , and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Not fat ?\nProject Manager:Not fat .\nIndustrial Designer:Not fat , huh .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Might be hard to find , though .\nProject Manager:Yep . But let's try it , okay , with the different uh {disfmarker} the designs , okay , the functional designs .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , okay .\nProject Manager:Okay ? So any other questions ?\nMarketing:Uh from her side , I don't think uh there's too many more questions .\nProject Manager:Okay . Thank you Christine for uh time being ,\nMarketing:If you can come to the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so then uh Ed , so can you tell about {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , from the marketing {disfmarker} yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s\nUser Interface:S 'scuse me for one sec .\nMarketing:I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro , with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro . For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market . Okay ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh in a {disfmarker} in the recent surveys , uh from the ages {disfmarker} fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price . That's a market price right now . Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive ,\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:but give them added things that they don't have now ,\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:then it w it could possibly sell . Obviously the risk is there . Too expensive , they're not gonna buy . But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting {disfmarker} two things that are interesting {gap} is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Speech recognition? .\nMarketing:And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands . I dunno , louder , softer , on , off . That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . {vocalsound} Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy {disfmarker} easy to use , if it's got simple remote {disfmarker} speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . So we're gonna have to look at it in a {vocalsound} in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But , price obviously we have to talk about .\nProject Manager:Yep . So what do you think about uh the design {gap} ? Do you think you can make it or uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:D uh I'm sorry ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about {disfmarker} of the speech recognition ?\nMarketing:Speech recognition .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , uh training is always an issue with uh commands .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So um {disfmarker} might uh {disfmarker} we can perhaps um {vocalsound} do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . Not sure how . {vocalsound} But um anyway , um {vocalsound} I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life . And um so , maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh {vocalsound} y you know sen send power to it . So uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things .\nUser Interface:It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , and it's words . It's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . It's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech . Otherwise , you can say remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Off . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your T_V_ . {vocalsound} So , I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it'd be a really good marketing gimmick .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:But , I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation .\nIndustrial Designer:Very good point .\nMarketing:Because tha w {vocalsound} with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:but th {vocalsound} if it's a one-word recognition , 'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} a friend of mine says call Mom , and it calls up Mom .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:'Kay the radio can be on and everything .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it has a exact word that it has to hear .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . If somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:okay . So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh yeah . Yeah . No , I think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements .\nMarketing:Like the t like the telephone . No because I {gap} this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:so well , that's kinda cute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh {disfmarker} the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , okay , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay . And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project . I don't think it's uh the difficult . And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what {gap} today .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , we'll find that out .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:What do they want ?\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:Uh {vocalsound} , a risk , take a risk on the market ? Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ?\nProject Manager:Yes . Yep .\nMarketing:Because it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new . Something that nobody has right now .\nProject Manager:Yeah but\nMarketing:And it's gonna cost .\nProject Manager:but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay . It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and how much you are going to benefit ,\nMarketing:Sure . Sure .\nProject Manager:okay . And uh , so I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of\nMarketing:Obviously .\nProject Manager:the money from this project .\nMarketing:If the bottom line is positive . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , okay I don't mind to convince the the management ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , okay , they want something uh new , okay . I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , I don't think they'll say no for that , okay . And uh I hope I can convince the management on that , okay . So if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your {disfmarker} you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , which you can uh hide their technology backup , okay , for your uh functional design or technical design , okay , then I am ready to do that . And uh what's your comments about uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um well , I mean , maybe if I go through my presentation , you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so you are finish , Ed , uh so I can uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yes . Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay , I'll uh hand over to Agnes . Just gonna close this . T Uh where are you , here ?\nUser Interface:Mm participant three .\nProject Manager:Participant three .\nUser Interface:Nope , here {gap}\nProject Manager:Okay , so I'll {disfmarker} yep . Okay .\nUser Interface:Good .\nProject Manager:Is it okay ?\nUser Interface:Thanks .\nProject Manager:Alri\nUser Interface:Yeah , and that's fine . Okay . So , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . So , in our case , existing remote controls . And then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . So , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . So , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . The buttons {disfmarker} it's not clear what they're supposed to do . Um often , you need to know specific button sequences {vocalsound} to get certain functionalities done , um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . And that the buttons are too small . So , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . Um they're hard to see , and okay , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities {vocalsound} that are needed . And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .\nProject Manager:Click mm .\nUser Interface:Which , I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably . Um so , that's pretty much it , an I don't know if you guys have any questions or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , it's um , seems {vocalsound} very understandable . Clearly your research and uh {disfmarker} and ours uh heading in the same direction ,\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:and um uh the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes , that's true . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh , you know , but that's okay . That's why we're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh , you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh , that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an {disfmarker} daily basis in a lot of cases , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:First . Yep . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Okay , so I don't have any questions . Sounds good .\nProject Manager:So {vocalsound} for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me ,\nUser Interface:Oh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .\nUser Interface:Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ?\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , maybe that would provide some guidance ?\nUser Interface:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Doesn't really tell us .\nProject Manager:So not really this one we are talk ab\nMarketing:Individual actions . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well it says individual actions ,\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . I think we should {vocalsound} do as many features as uh {disfmarker} start with all of them right now\nUser Interface:I thought {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion .\nProject Manager:Okay , that will be great . {vocalsound} And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} You can object if you want to {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No , I I'm just thinking in terms of time ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} She's objecting . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:like if {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes , now I'm objecting . No , I mean , I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting ,\nMarketing:Oh th {vocalsound} we s we still have {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:guess {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:'cause w our meeting time has run out .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Somebody else has go to use this room ,\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:and , you know , we can't hang out here\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and talk about this , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Sure .\nProject Manager:Okay , what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , okay , then uh we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , and uh then we will come back again in the {disfmarker} in the next meeting . So thanks for coming and uh I'll send you minutes of meeting , and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information . Okay ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So let's go for lunch then . Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you very much .\nMarketing:Agreed . {vocalsound}\n",

Industrial Designer, Marketing and User Interface were each invited to give a presentation on the subject that they are in charge of. On the basis of conducted user requirement survey, Industrial Designer and User Interface put forward their ideas on remote control features which are new to the existing market, along with the functionality and outlook of the product. Among all the features, speech recognition command takes up the majority of discussed subjects. The group also discussed the material appropriate to use in the construction. After the group determined the financial target of this project, as well as the production price and reasonable selling price, Marketing suggested taking a risk in price rise.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:So we come to the third meetings . I have {gap} good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . So we will talk about some specific details .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh {disfmarker} I'm participant two .\nProject Manager:This {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Components design .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique {vocalsound} to to store the energy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:We also um {vocalsound} we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . But if we use battery {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . {vocalsound} But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} from the technical uh point of view . Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work {vocalsound} in a cluttered uh {vocalsound} uh environment .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are {disfmarker} mm will be uh very happy to have a {vocalsound} a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip {vocalsound} that are uh well cheaper . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And s so uh we can move to the next slide .\nUser Interface:Sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:What is this single curved {disfmarker} what does it mean ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote .\nUser Interface:So it's it's not {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You you will have the {disfmarker} well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yo l yeah . When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah the um that's the point . The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That that's what it means by kinetic .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah and by {disfmarker} well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy .\nUser Interface:Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But I d I don't know it's {disfmarker} if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} Mm . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product {vocalsound} ready for market . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said .\nUser Interface:Mm mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wha\nIndustrial Designer:So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh {vocalsound} if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .\nUser Interface:Ah the department . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's it .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker} So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I take care , it's all right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So the titanium case is the normal case that {disfmarker} I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} All right . Yeah .\nUser Interface:'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . There's another point I want to make , is that the uh {disfmarker} well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some {disfmarker} why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can {vocalsound} use {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , maybe n\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We will , okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Three .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh {disfmarker} we are more {disfmarker} we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .\nProject Manager:What's the function of this button .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . So .\nProject Manager:I think it makes the the interface really {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ea easy to use . So next one .\nProject Manager:Graphical user interface {gap} .\nUser Interface:{gap} function five . So I can use the button , the mouse maybe .\nProject Manager:A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So next line . So the {disfmarker} here are some examples . So they cluster the buttons together . They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . Mm but this interface are kind of confusing . Uh basically there are too many buttons . Right . Next one .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So some people are propose voice recognition and so {disfmarker} ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine {vocalsound} for this by a company\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:when you tell the {disfmarker} you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . So I just got an email saying that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm mm mm .\nUser Interface:And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah fine .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The next one . Mm so somebody {disfmarker} some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real {disfmarker} so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Next one . And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . Like the one we have here . Uh , next one . So mm\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so there are a few aspects that I collected here . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh mm {disfmarker} yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So {disfmarker} But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the {disfmarker} currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f {gap} customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point . The next one . And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:S a good idea .\nUser Interface:The next one .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So this guy {disfmarker} this is another company that provides big buttons . At {disfmarker} I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} T_V_ remote controller where are you ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , {vocalsound} for example .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?\nUser Interface:Is it possible ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh {disfmarker} the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top {disfmarker} on the top up arrow {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:And here are {disfmarker} is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So {vocalsound} we have many concepts there\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And basically uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I {vocalsound} I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .\nUser Interface:Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control {gap} and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That's a good idea .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:To have a help button .\nUser Interface:A help button .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So you are display on the screen .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:On T_V_ T_V_ screen .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} on the T_V_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer:On the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote .\nProject Manager:So just you push the button\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:and we will {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh .\nUser Interface:So that eliminates all the complicated documentation {gap} ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:okay . So wi\nMarketing:But people are often enough looking at the help ,\nProject Manager:If the if {disfmarker}\nMarketing:once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No {vocalsound} In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's a psychology .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} In a marketing point of view .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And let us see what the market demands .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:We could just go to my presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} uh wel well I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people .\nMarketing:Yeah that's right .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So it's the same {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Same remote with some {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Can be used by both kids and old people .\nMarketing:Both yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i {vocalsound} it could be a cube ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the {vocalsound} um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe for kids , kids they like uh t no l they like to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Small {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh well .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So le le let's see what uh what {vocalsound} people want .\nUser Interface:Let's see the market demand .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And then we can decide what what we can {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:What what {gap} market {disfmarker} yes yes .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . And we found the following solutions which we could {disfmarker} which would be helpful for our design . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yes .\nMarketing:So this were the findings which we found . And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . Most of {disfmarker} fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them {vocalsound} rather than watching the T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So {vocalsound} they're frustrated a lot {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , the functionalities yeah .\nMarketing:So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen .\nUser Interface:Big screen .\nIndustrial Designer:It's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce {vocalsound} and it's not really {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control .\nUser Interface:Mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm . The thing {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:We just {vocalsound} play around\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have {vocalsound} a big screen in front of you , s\nProject Manager:You can use this screen instead of the big se screen ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:instead of use the {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:If you re-use the existing screen , we element {disfmarker} eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:maybe even better .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So\nIndustrial Designer:So I th I I {vocalsound} well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh\nUser Interface:Yeah . More on a fancy design .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah that's fine .\nIndustrial Designer:on the speech recognition if the technology is available\nMarketing:Yeah . I mean that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results .\nUser Interface:Mm . Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So i is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh yeah we have uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time {gap} . Is i if i\nIndustrial Designer:So price of uh L_C_D_ display .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition .\nProject Manager:Mm . It's for {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ask our R_ and D_ department .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it's just for small vocabulary . We {disfmarker} it's not {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary ,\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And ho\nMarketing:say eighty commands or so .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah okay .\nUser Interface:And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker} Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Push push {gap} .\nMarketing:Mm , the scroll button , {gap} from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah I think that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or {vocalsound} help button .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button\nUser Interface:Don't use the buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Important .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But they are just less used compar\nMarketing:They're not used much .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:like uh a a list of function\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and then you choose with the with the button to {disfmarker} well you navigate\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah . So so the at most {disfmarker} more power uh .\nIndustrial Designer:and you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen {vocalsound} I think that just five buttons are sufficient ,\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:one to go up left right down and uh enter\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen\nMarketing:And accordingly you can just increase or decrease .\nProject Manager:It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:so {vocalsound} i i it's not really worth to get {disfmarker} to have the image if you don't look at , so .\nUser Interface:I if {disfmarker} Mm . Mm .\nProject Manager:And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah that has to be checked out .\nUser Interface:I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and then you t turn {disfmarker} you just press lef increase or decrease button\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and the same for the volume and the channel , {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:with the help of speech recogniser you can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean , {gap} better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and also with the speech recognition .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case .\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . A and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes .\nIndustrial Designer:Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and {vocalsound} when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t\nProject Manager:You will listen to a peep , {vocalsound} special peep .\nUser Interface:Where {gap} , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Or it could be also something like this ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .\nUser Interface:Put it back at the charge .\nIndustrial Designer:Put {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command ,\nProject Manager:But you don't you don't have to move the the charger .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:because there are problems with a voice command .\nUser Interface:Hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:You have to keep it {gap} .\nMarketing:I mean charger would be fixed\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:because it's always with electricity plugged .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh uh the remote is lost .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm . There's {disfmarker} mm . Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah that's right .\nUser Interface:That {disfmarker} we can {disfmarker} what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:because uh every time you're off the computer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where {disfmarker} to the charger .\nMarketing:It's an good reminder ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . So you will never get lost {gap} {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:yeah that's right .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Maybe for some people {gap} {vocalsound} lazy people .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah because everything is programmed inside .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y\nMarketing:And of course the final point is a fancy look .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:They were ugly .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} They {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:I think we should have something {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well the last one with the um {vocalsound} yeah with the two parts was uh {gap} original , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:With uh two two two parts controller .\nMarketing:I mean {gap} uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and {vocalsound} use it , you can't avoid him .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:But you can have an button for child lock .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .\nMarketing:Mm uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah . Mm .\nMarketing:That's right .\nProject Manager:Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just {disfmarker} yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically\nUser Interface:Mm . {gap} these are probl yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm .\nProject Manager:{gap} . So if he {gap} .\nMarketing:I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So for mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .\nMarketing:Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these {gap} could be included .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:because uh if you want {gap} uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but if {gap} name the channel by by name {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh {disfmarker} basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five\nProject Manager:Yeah it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:and suddenly {vocalsound} the screen the channel goes to twenty five .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I mean the the {disfmarker} you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but well {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing:and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:So it's better to have some prefix {gap} before the number .\nUser Interface:But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .\nMarketing:Yeah something , some code .\nUser Interface:You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm mm . Well I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That will be too big .\nProject Manager:Or just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser .\nProject Manager:It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh ?\nProject Manager:Because you have to s t uh a ch\nUser Interface:Well , it's convenient for the user .\nProject Manager:yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .\nMarketing:Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .\nProject Manager:Or maybe {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary ,\nUser Interface:The {disfmarker} uh uh mm . {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager:just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .\nUser Interface:I I think that I have {disfmarker} mm mm {vocalsound} I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the {disfmarker} you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want\nMarketing:Yeah , the {gap} .\nUser Interface:and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .\nUser Interface:Mm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way .\nProject Manager:No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train {disfmarker} you have to create the vocabulary by yourself .\nUser Interface:Oh , okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I uh I also {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:By associating each channel with the name or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And for each one has his own . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah , {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Because uh I remember when I was a {vocalsound} young child with my sister we {disfmarker} yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Or you have to s {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty {vocalsound} and just run , s\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:A and in the same lines we would have a {disfmarker} one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name {disfmarker} bad uh reputation for our company .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or we can switch on or switch off the the special {gap} , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah that's right that should be an option .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's {disfmarker} well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:I think these are the practical problems . So we need to take care of them in the design .\nProject Manager:Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's time to close this meeting .\nUser Interface:Well , you you stay a five minutes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah {gap} . {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think we can just press the okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Thanks for your collaborations .\nIndustrial Designer:So I see ya .\nMarketing:Okay . See you another thirty minutes .\n",
        "summary": "The team discussed the conceptual design and some specific details in this meeting. Industrial Designer talked about the components concept of industrial design, such as the different choice of energy and the different material of the remote control. The team would find out which one to use in the future. User Interface designer gave the presentation about system design, mainly about programme design for different users and to help them use the device. Then the team decided to discuss the marketing part at first, then discuss what to design. Marketing talked about specific details found in the market survey. The team agreed to use fancier design, less buttons and focus on voice recognition. They would find out whether using LCD on remote controls was too expensive or not. Team members agreed to use a voice commander and fixed charger, which would prevent the remote control getting lost. Then the team talked about the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser.",

Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . We have uh forty minutes .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Oh , well this is the {vocalsound} the closing already .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So uh {disfmarker} well we start off with the th the first presentation then . Uh , I think um in uh {disfmarker} we have to do it in uh in right order .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Maybe the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't know what the right order is . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh .\nProject Manager:Oh that . It won't {disfmarker} doesn't {disfmarker} Maybe we should start with the the technical functions .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay ,\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:how can I get this on the whiteboard ?\nProject Manager:Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder .\nUser Interface:In project .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , I've done that .\nProject Manager:You've already done that ?\nUser Interface:No can that open .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one .\nUser Interface:Open it there .\nProject Manager:Uh , well . Yes . Uh-oh . New thing . Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound} About the get {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh {disfmarker} a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um , Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um {disfmarker} Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's {disfmarker} it is uh {disfmarker} can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it's all very uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and it's not uh very specialised uh technology . {vocalsound} I haven't come to here , but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time .\nProject Manager:Oh . Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} What ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No . Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:But nothing restricted for user interface ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . M\nUser Interface:With technical {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah .\nUser Interface:I don't know .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Remote control is nothing special nowadays .\nProject Manager:R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But I kind of uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think so ,\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah , {gap} okay .\nIndustrial Designer:because of the {disfmarker} all the televisions uh {disfmarker} there are a few {disfmarker} maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions ,\nUser Interface:Yes . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ?\nProject Manager:Well , we'll see . We'll see later on .\nUser Interface:Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got ,\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:but uh I got these two ,\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:and I think they're {disfmarker} we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . {vocalsound} th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t\nProject Manager:Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? {vocalsound} The ones I {disfmarker} I've uh received from the account manager .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but it {disfmarker} I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .\nUser Interface:Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh {disfmarker} yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . {gap} we should we should choose one uh {disfmarker} we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v\nMarketing:Yes , I agree . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ? Well , what {disfmarker} that's what you want {disfmarker} trying to say .\nUser Interface:Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and {disfmarker} we have to choose for novice user .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:But I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use .\nProject Manager:Yeah , well {vocalsound} some of these {disfmarker} Uh , yeah . Well , some of that will {disfmarker} Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements .\nUser Interface:Yeah , probably , yeah .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And from that on we can {gap} user requirements what we need more . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy {disfmarker} the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um {disfmarker} uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .\nMarketing:Yes .\nUser Interface:M you can just {vocalsound} you can k {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I haven't really found a conclusion like that .\nUser Interface:you can keep it in mind that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the {disfmarker} with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Design .\nUser Interface:yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think .\nMarketing:Sounds interesting .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that was it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager:Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah . It's alright . Um {disfmarker} Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um {disfmarker} yes . The working method um {vocalsound} there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , {vocalsound} three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . {vocalsound} Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um , {vocalsound} relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got {disfmarker} we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um {vocalsound} an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . So , {vocalsound} what I was thinking {disfmarker} oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh {disfmarker} there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh {disfmarker} yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Visually presents .\nMarketing:Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh {disfmarker} consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . That was kind of what I found .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Well , then we {disfmarker} I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes .\nProject Manager:Uh , well some of the uh new requirements {vocalsound} make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Because um uh s decided to put {disfmarker} They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . Well , now I see four .\nMarketing:Two ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's kinda strange . Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off .\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's impossible , I think .\nUser Interface:No way .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No uh , I agree , I agree .\nProject Manager:So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special {disfmarker} put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Not too much , no .\nProject Manager:You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:I don't know . I think that uh that's what they're trying to say .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but it is {disfmarker} it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that .\nMarketing:Mayb yeah ?\nProject Manager:Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , {vocalsound} you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Well I think , yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Not too much then , bu alright .\nProject Manager:no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , {vocalsound} something else nice to know .\nUser Interface:But what's our slogan ?\nProject Manager:Sorry ? Yeah , {vocalsound} you will have to look that up . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:The slogan uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , I'll have a look .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think it's something about the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Puts fashion in electronics . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:We put the fashion in electronics .\nProject Manager:Oh , okay . {vocalsound} I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Sense simplicity . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Sense and simplicity . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay well , {vocalsound} let's go back to the the agenda . So we've now had to {disfmarker} the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements . That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the {disfmarker} maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh {disfmarker} yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:I think we can implement more functions then , because um {vocalsound} basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology\nUser Interface:Yeah , but wha\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:and therefore will be a more {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other ,\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , ma\nUser Interface:Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So why should j we put this function in ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well , I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think more {disfmarker} I think uh people {disfmarker} younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But I think uh you {disfmarker} we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have {disfmarker} Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:You can uh , know , you {gap} you can {vocalsound} make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was {disfmarker} that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh\nMarketing:Yeah , control .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but uh you said {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:control , remotely .\nUser Interface:Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the {disfmarker} The new project requirements told us not to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's n Yeah .\nProject Manager:But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other {disfmarker} maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind ,\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:or n what d what do you guys think ?\nIndustrial Designer:But you can put them under the same button .\nMarketing:Not much more than that .\nProject Manager:Yeah , if {disfmarker} as far as possible .\nMarketing:Yep . Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .\nProject Manager:But what do you think ?\nMarketing:So t\nProject Manager:Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that {disfmarker} to control other devices ?\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:No , you don't think so ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No , new requirements say no .\nProject Manager:Yeah , the new requirements say so .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But you can put a play and stop and and rewind .\nProject Manager:Well , maybe it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , but we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th {vocalsound} with lot more functions .\nMarketing:Y yes .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yep , exactly . That's that's wha\nMarketing:But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever ,\nProject Manager:No no , you don't {vocalsound} {disfmarker} No no , you don't need it . No , no .\nUser Interface:No , no . Exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh .\nMarketing:just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward .\nProject Manager:Okay , but we have to think uh {disfmarker} w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess ,\nMarketing:Yeah , I know , but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so um but uh from my experience it's kinda {vocalsound} a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult .\nUser Interface:Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh {disfmarker} Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} keep it simple and look more at th\nProject Manager:And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote .\nUser Interface:No . It's only for television . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , but there are there are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , nothing more . Exactly .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Alright .\nProject Manager:Um , but what televis\nIndustrial Designer:But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh {disfmarker} dozens of of remote controls that have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And simple .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The user interface is easy .\nProject Manager:Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels .\nUser Interface:And the basic {disfmarker} yeah , basic functions , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes , definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh ,\nUser Interface:It's too much integrated in the other .\nProject Manager:Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Probably .\nMarketing:Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not {disfmarker} nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader ,\nProject Manager:Oh , okay .\nMarketing:then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it {vocalsound} quite often .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And\nUser Interface:Will you look {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we have to {disfmarker} well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated .\nUser Interface:Look at the market .\nProject Manager:We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote .\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I don't know what you th guys think .\nMarketing:Might be . Might be .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I {disfmarker} uh , it's {gap} {disfmarker} {gap} Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but do you like to have a {disfmarker} such a s stop button ? Or do you think it uh {disfmarker} I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function .\nUser Interface:Well , uh when you uh uh {disfmarker} when you look uh {disfmarker} for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the {disfmarker} for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , it goes {disfmarker} Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why {vocalsound} it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , but you could put\nUser Interface:Yeah , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages .\nProject Manager:Well yeah uh ,\nIndustrial Designer:If you have seven pages , you can go up and down .\nProject Manager:lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:I think we should just put one teletext button on it .\nUser Interface:True .\nProject Manager:Then we meet uh the new requirements . we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess .\nUser Interface:A simple {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? Or do we {disfmarker} uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present ,\nProject Manager:Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also .\nUser Interface:But trendy , yeah .\nMarketing:yep .\nProject Manager:Or maybe you should place them on a {disfmarker} uh , in a special way ?\nUser Interface:I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick .\nProject Manager:Yeah , something or uh {vocalsound} somethin special way to to zap through the {disfmarker} it has to {vocalsound} s it has to be {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly .\nUser Interface:Original . It was uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yep .\nUser Interface:True .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and it {disfmarker} the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid {disfmarker} at a rapid pace .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Oh , what should we decide on then ? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:No , it's o just signals uh {disfmarker} and the television d uh does the rest .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:Maybe uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No , okay , but we don't have to {disfmarker} uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:Uh maybe we {disfmarker} uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .\nProject Manager:I think\nIndustrial Designer:The most standard batteries .\nProject Manager:I think that we should use uh d\nUser Interface:Yeah ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think double A_ .\nProject Manager:yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:{gap} {disfmarker} th the most uh {disfmarker} Well , it has to be simple , and I wi\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:The most ordinary uh batteries .\nProject Manager:Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? M m m more than thirty minutes ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think about twenty minutes .\nProject Manager:Uh ten twenty minutes . {vocalsound} Well , uh these these shouldn't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Early break .\nIndustrial Designer:But i in a way we have to be uh uh special .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's {disfmarker} Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can {disfmarker} what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe th m\nProject Manager:Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh {vocalsound} ten to twelve or whatever . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:To find him . That's maybe {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} I don't know . I don't know .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i {gap} has something nice .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep .\nProject Manager:Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:or maybe it should {vocalsound} {disfmarker} or an {disfmarker} or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's gonna cost twenty five Euros .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but the {disfmarker} well , it's already been done .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but that's {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Nah . {vocalsound} Yeah , that's true . But {disfmarker} and I think it's gonna be uh very uh {disfmarker} it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:{gap} it has to be used something special ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and you really {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it has to ,\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know .\nMarketing:No , that's true .\nProject Manager:So maybe uh that's i I think that's {vocalsound} when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it .\nUser Interface:Be original , yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh , also for you maybe , when t you {disfmarker} it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend {disfmarker} use friendly as well , you know .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah .\nProject Manager:So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:Must brain-storm .\nMarketing:Yeah , a swapable front or whatever .\nProject Manager:Yeah , or just different colours would be uh {disfmarker} I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control .\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:For the remote control . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It could be be {disfmarker} Yeah , you never know , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Why not ?\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:More money for us .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But it {disfmarker} and I think we have to make it quite big .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Quite big . Yeah , you think ?\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nMarketing:Yes , definitely , definitely .\nProject Manager:{gap} people {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's to be uh a formed for your hand .\nProject Manager:So , and and also because uh it is expensive . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:want to be {disfmarker} you don't want to get it l make it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yes , it {disfmarker} it it should be f {vocalsound} be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A standard or something .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah , you have to put it on its {disfmarker} So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table .\nMarketing:Yeah . A face ?\nProject Manager:{gap} no no , {gap} put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:More like a joystick then .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep .\nUser Interface:It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah , but {disfmarker} yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros .\nProject Manager:That it's it's fashionable .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} I {gap} I don't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise .\nProject Manager:Oh , yeah .\nMarketing:That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ?\nIndustrial Designer:But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but but when you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh , okay .\nUser Interface:On the television .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh , that's kind of nice .\nUser Interface:Oh , like this .\nMarketing:If an {disfmarker} a button in in that uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Or you can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:A char {vocalsound} chargeable . Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , that w yeah , but {disfmarker} yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Why not .\nProject Manager:Maybe you , but {vocalsound} we don't know much about production cost , but when you {disfmarker} you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money {disfmarker} there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , {gap} rechargeable units .\nIndustrial Designer:With recharger .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , it's not gonna be that expen\nUser Interface:Production . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh I I think it's a great idea .\nUser Interface:It should be possible . I think it's a good idea .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays .\nUser Interface:To make a base or something ?\nMarketing:Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , but is that handy ?\nProject Manager:Well , I {disfmarker} well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one {gap} .\nUser Interface:It's it's it's it's\nProject Manager:And uh you can always find your remote control up {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it's not the purpose to be handy , it's\nIndustrial Designer:But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries .\nProject Manager:Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could {disfmarker} when that's {disfmarker} when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger ,\nIndustrial Designer:And then you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but you will {disfmarker} you do need uh also an {disfmarker} uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah , but that's not {disfmarker} it's ugly , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't know .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still {vocalsound} still put a bleep function in it ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:but um I think the bay is definitely uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um {disfmarker} Well , we uh {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . We can save on the on the functions . We just {vocalsound} put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up ,\nMarketing:Sure , why not . Yep .\nProject Manager:it's also nice . And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to {disfmarker} we uh {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it's not a easy market .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We have to something special . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:True .\nProject Manager:and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Definitely .\nProject Manager:because we aren't gonna put {disfmarker}\nMarketing:With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely .\nProject Manager:Yeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this {gap} {disfmarker} and then you also you got the stand-up thing . Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh , if it {disfmarker} let's {disfmarker} well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And the first thing we {disfmarker} the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that .\nUser Interface:Yeah , we c\nProject Manager:But it would be nice .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It would be nice , yes .\nProject Manager:It's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo {gap} {disfmarker} I've experienced that that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so {vocalsound} yes .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay . So , easy functions . Well , we will we will {disfmarker} I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi\nUser Interface:Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But it's also annoying .\nMarketing:Yeah , why not .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} 'cause as long as it stays {disfmarker} as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {gap} true .\nProject Manager:Then it beeps all the time and {gap} .\nMarketing:No , that's true .\nProject Manager:You don't want to have {disfmarker} ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable {gap} . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma\nMarketing:Why not .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} But you pay for it .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look {disfmarker} get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of {disfmarker} they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think it's brilliant .\nMarketing:Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I've never {disfmarker} it's so simple , but I've never seen it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:M maybe we should really {vocalsound} do this .\nUser Interface:And you can leave it just there .\nMarketing:No . Nearly .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} {vocalsound} Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't uh synched .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh , now I've put uh {disfmarker} well , {gap} it is twenty p\nUser Interface:Yeah , I'll {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ?\nMarketing:Something like that , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think .\nUser Interface:Uh fifteen minutes .\nProject Manager:We've decided on the functions . Well , there is some {disfmarker} oh . There is a closing sheet . We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:Oh {vocalsound} okay , I'll make sure {disfmarker} I'll {disfmarker} I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . I think these are more important than the first ones , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We'll see .\nUser Interface:Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ?\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:That not not everything in one one uh folder .\nMarketing:Maarten , five minutes .\nProject Manager:Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh {disfmarker} the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones {gap} well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do {disfmarker} put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get {disfmarker} it's not working {vocalsound} when you try to write second uh paper or something .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Maybe .\nMarketing:No , that's true uh , yeah .\nProject Manager:And then you {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen .\nMarketing:Should we by the way draw um\nProject Manager:{gap} this kind of looks you like .\nMarketing:on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Of the shape .\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , probably , it would be nice .\nUser Interface:Or the sh\nMarketing:I dunno . Has anyone got um {vocalsound} a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Do you get an idea of the shape ?\nMarketing:I don't , for one .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe like this pen .\nMarketing:A bit bigger I guess , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , bigger .\nUser Interface:A little bit bigger , yeah but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:The shape is nice , it's um something different , and we want we want that .\nIndustrial Designer:It has to feel nice in your hand .\nProject Manager:Well , I I {vocalsound} I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:or I think some {disfmarker} maybe we should {disfmarker} no , that will be too costly .\nUser Interface:Oh , uh look {disfmarker} uh look at the pictures .\nProject Manager:We shou we could also , that was a {disfmarker} would also be an idea , but I don't think it {disfmarker} I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:That would also be nice . But that's gonna {disfmarker} then you c then you don't\nMarketing:Yeah , but {vocalsound} twelve and a half Euros ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it {disfmarker} that's not something i that's in the production cost {disfmarker} {gap} a one {disfmarker} it's a one time , you know {disfmarker} s was {disfmarker} it's a single cost .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , m but but then you can {disfmarker} nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager:Would be a nice idea though . I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r {gap} it has to have round forms or something . Like something like that or so or so\nMarketing:Something like that is very ergonomic .\nProject Manager:And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Put it in there uh {gap} wire on it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well . {gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that .\nProject Manager:Volume and programme , yeah .\nMarketing:Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part .\nProject Manager:And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of {disfmarker} no , no , you have to {gap} {disfmarker} Maybe on the side of it .\nMarketing:Maybe ro roun rounds\nUser Interface:Yeah , side of it .\nMarketing:uh uh l sorry .\nProject Manager:Along the side uh strip of {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote .\nMarketing:Oh . Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well , theys have to be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , uh probably at the side . You know look at the front , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just {gap} like that . And then you have a strip of uh lights or something\nUser Interface:Yeah , exactly , and then there is {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah , something like that , yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . {gap} maybe put something on top of it {vocalsound} or , you know , like that's {disfmarker} looks funny .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} No .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't know . Or some bump .\nMarketing:I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then .\nProject Manager:Maybe some {disfmarker} Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Bumper or something .\nProject Manager:We'll have to think about it . I think we're we're done .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes , we are .\nProject Manager:We can save this one .\nUser Interface:Lunch break .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Alright . Yes , I guess it's lunch time .\nUser Interface:Okay then .\nProject Manager:Mm mm . {gap}\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Half and hour ?\nUser Interface:Okay , five {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that was what uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't know about the lunch break .\nProject Manager:Mm , we'll hear about it .\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh {gap} . {gap} . {vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "In this meeting, the team brainstormed about the look, functions and gadgets to adopt in the remote control and finally reached a decision on the overall design. The meeting started with discussion on the technical functions based on some new requirements delivered by Project Manager and on market research results presented by Marketing. In the end, the team agreed on including mainly basic functions on the remote control, adding a joystick-like gadget that was able to charge and track the device, enlarging certain buttons and making it flashy.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay . Everybody found his place again ? Yeah ?\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:That's nice . Okay so this is our second meeting . And uh still failing ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh now we're going um into the functional design . Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . So that we can move onto the second uh phase . But first this phase . Um first an announcement . There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} There's our {vocalsound} ghost mouse again . That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's in wing C_ and E_ .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . But it's going to be cold anyway , so {vocalsound} I don't think you're gonna need it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Then our agenda . Now first the opening . Uh this time I will take the minutes . Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . So we've got forty minutes for all of it . So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Um who wants to be first ?\nMarketing:Think I'll go first .\nProject Manager:Okay . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Just maybe it's easier if you um {disfmarker} Yeah I think you will tell {gap} your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So {disfmarker} Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:some things . Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Then these are the {disfmarker} This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . Um {disfmarker} Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So {disfmarker} Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . Um {disfmarker} The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . And the functionality {disfmarker} As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily . Um {disfmarker} Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:That would be all .\nProject Manager:Thank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ?\nMarketing:Any questions ?\nProject Manager:About functional requirements ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:that's clear . {gap} Now to the second .\nMarketing:'Kay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh okay . Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah you can take your time .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:We've got uh plenty of time ,\nUser Interface:Mm ?\nMarketing:Yeah\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:you should go to the top thingy . Slide show .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:Yeah . There it is . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nUser Interface:Um yeah . I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and {gap} not much information about it , {gap} {disfmarker} Um about uh interface but uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . So um {disfmarker} But uh it must be uh user-friendly . So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh uh uh {disfmarker} Yeah . In one um remote control .\nProject Manager:One remote .\nUser Interface:But um {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Um yeah . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um few uh buttons but uh {disfmarker} This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um {disfmarker} Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um {disfmarker} My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . So um {disfmarker} Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um {disfmarker} Uh this the remote control uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh {vocalsound} I dunno um {disfmarker} And um here you've got a s kind of a display . It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh {gap} . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or {vocalsound} {disfmarker} So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device .\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So uh that's uh my uh idea about it .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Um yeah and {disfmarker} Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So a touchscreen . Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . Everybody uh have to use it so {disfmarker} Uh ol even even old people um young people . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . So uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Uh yeah . That was uh my uh part of it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Anybody has questions about the technical functions ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:N I I don't think so . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something .\nProject Manager:Touchscreen .\nUser Interface:Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah . Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh {vocalsound} for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh .\nProject Manager:Huh .\nUser Interface:So it's possible .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:'Kay . That's nice . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well it would certainly make a fancy design .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But the {disfmarker} It wouldn't be very robust .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it .\nMarketing:That is true .\nProject Manager:That's right .\nUser Interface:Yeah that's true .\nProject Manager:Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ?\nMarketing:We would have to look into that .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} And then we {gap} have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:That's {gap} . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think it's going to {disfmarker} Uh it's not too much . Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . That's it .\nProject Manager:Okay . Thank you . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because {vocalsound} uh it will be too complex\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . So it has to be simple .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um internet is also mentioned {gap} in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . Yeah .\nMarketing:So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . I'm pretty much against it .\nProject Manager:Against the no teletext ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . But I mean if I s if I see this , it's {disfmarker} I think we're just gonna go for another\nProject Manager:Yeah it's it is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} forty {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Standard remote .\nMarketing:pretty\nProject Manager:No I think we can\nMarketing:and not innovative\nProject Manager:I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons\nMarketing:remote control .\nProject Manager:which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .\nMarketing:Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:And besides that , they're not very critical so {disfmarker} I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .\nProject Manager:But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think {gap} {disfmarker} the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So let's try it .\nMarketing:No . I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I think that if we're {disfmarker} If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um {disfmarker} I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . It's a big success .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think .\nProject Manager:Very big success .\nMarketing:I haven't heard of it .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Uh . I think so as well .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just change our focus on the project , and I think we can uh we can sell this .\nProject Manager:Uh I simply think um\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . {vocalsound} 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Yes . But obviously the board tends to disagree .\nProject Manager:No we we haven't voted yet , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem . Or is teletext a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , also .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So I suggest uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .\nUser Interface:It's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Is anybody um really against teletext ?\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:No ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext . I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles ,\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh that's a good idea .\nProject Manager:Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um {disfmarker} Functionality should be few buttons , you said .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So to keep it simple .\nMarketing:But I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause {disfmarker} Well might be .\nUser Interface:If it's only for televi\nMarketing:But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . But do you need {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So we can s we can skip the display ,\nMarketing:I think if you if you only l\nUser Interface:so uh we don't need it .\nProject Manager:But do you need the buttons for one to zero .\nMarketing:Nah .\nProject Manager:Maybe c we can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that .\nProject Manager:Maybe we can use uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? Or a joystick like ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:There are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nMarketing:That's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And besides that it's um {disfmarker} If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons .\nProject Manager:That's right .\nIndustrial Designer:So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{gap} the numbers yeah . Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . But I think there won't be very much buttons .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or there don't have to be a lot .\nMarketing:But I don't think {disfmarker} I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area .\nProject Manager:The number of buttons ?\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:I think it's very important in the in the design .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ .\nProject Manager:To operate only the T_V_ yeah .\nMarketing:'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:So .\nMarketing:So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .\nProject Manager:'Kay . So we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's right .\nMarketing:which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons .\nMarketing:Maybe . Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and {disfmarker} But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .\nProject Manager:Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ?\nIndustrial Designer:It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy .\nProject Manager:'Cause it can be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:Because I think that's uh {disfmarker} That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:or very {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:That's a nice requirement . Docking station .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So we're just gonna focus on the extras ?\nProject Manager:I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:like to have extra in a new remote control .\nProject Manager:That's a good point . Um {disfmarker} You said they easily get lost as well .\nMarketing:Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .\nMarketing:Yeah that was what I suggested .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound .\nMarketing:You have it on {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah\nUser Interface:Hm .\nMarketing:you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So\nMarketing:So you know where it is .\nProject Manager:audio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:{gap} Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause\nProject Manager:Yeah . It will be too much as well .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:it's uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing:I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,\nProject Manager:Based .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah .\nMarketing:but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen .\nMarketing:Just a small screen\nProject Manager:That's a good idea . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:with two {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Some extra info . Feedback .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:But I dunno if that would\nProject Manager:As the small screen .\nMarketing:that would fit into the costs .\nProject Manager:Extra button info . I think that should be possible as well . Um {vocalsound} let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions {disfmarker} Yeah . 'Kay . And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So that doesn't really matter .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:So I think we nee\nMarketing:I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .\nProject Manager:Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh what do we want ? If we want um a {gap} with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can\nMarketing:I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:target the real elderly people .\nMarketing:I think that would be a {disfmarker} If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And I think , I think there would be a good market for it .\nProject Manager:So that's the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If we're able to really bring an innovative product .\nProject Manager:{gap} Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .\nMarketing:Yeah the really {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Sixty .\nMarketing:But I'd have to look into that a little more .\nProject Manager:Okay . And different cultures . Are we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I don't think they have different television sets uh\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:in uh every country .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We've got five minutes left {vocalsound} just now .\nUser Interface:So 'Kay .\nProject Manager:Small warning .\nMarketing:'Kay . And with uh the little screen in it , {gap} which explains the buttons . You could {disfmarker} I think we n it would be a lot easier to\nProject Manager:Should {disfmarker}\nMarketing:adapt it to different cultures .\nProject Manager:Yeah . In different languages , you know . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:or you have to put a language button in it ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:but that will be a bit unnecessary I think .\nUser Interface:No . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's better to put it on different markets with it all .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . So\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:that's the the target . Uh then a few small things .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh okay . I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . {vocalsound} Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , {vocalsound} uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . So um\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:I thank you for this meeting . And I think we have a lunch-break now .\nMarketing:That's good .\nProject Manager:So that's a good thing .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "The whole meeting was focused on the functional design of the new remote control project. First of all, Marketing, User Interface, and Industrial Designer each gave a presentation about user requirements, technical function design, and working design respectively. Then, Project Manager announced some amendments to project requirements, which automatically rejected some of the previous assumptions and aroused further discussion about design and functionality with people above 40 as target customers.",

Oh I thought we all were .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I have one too , okay .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:S\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nUser Interface:Whoops I forgot to put the thing on {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right . I just wanna {disfmarker} 'cause basically I can't re I've {disfmarker} really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna {disfmarker} rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that {vocalsound} wanted to know your names again .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay I'm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll {vocalsound} you know . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Sure , that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm Catherine with a C_ . C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ .\nProject Manager:Okay , and\nUser Interface:Uh Gabriel .\nProject Manager:Gabriel . E_L_ is it ?\nUser Interface:E_L_ .\nProject Manager:'Kay .

Sorry .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:True .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh , right .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this {disfmarker} for the purposes of this meeting {disfmarker} what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But hopefully you've been {disfmarker} actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna {disfmarker} each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . {vocalsound} Um .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Then we're gonna {vocalsound} work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll {gap} sort of conclude {gap} anything else comes up at the end of it .\nIndustrial Designer:How long is the meeting ?\nProject Manager:This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound} No problem . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can {disfmarker} you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa ,\nMarketing:I'm fine . Yeah .\nProject Manager:are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here\nMarketing:I uh yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Think she's finishing up her presentation .\nMarketing:D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No no . {vocalsound} Uh I'm done . Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um {disfmarker} well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I think the first thing we should look at is um {vocalsound} probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:if we wanna hear from you first .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um just connecting this .\nProject Manager:You don't have to worry about screwing it in just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Are we getting i Really ?\nProject Manager:there you go .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh {disfmarker} Uh . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've {disfmarker} oh no , you can't see a thing . {vocalsound} Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nUser Interface:Oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um {vocalsound} the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well {disfmarker} okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called {gap} six , or something like that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh and then {vocalsound} um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design .\nProject Manager:Great . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally .\nIndustrial Designer:Really ? Cool .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , should I erase this or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?\nIndustrial Designer:Fine . {vocalsound} Or suggestions ?\nMarketing:Is a battery like the only way of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nUser Interface:Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , you blow on it and i {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:In indoors . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No , no {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Bicycle power .\nMarketing:No I meant like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No 'cause like cha 'cause {disfmarker} always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:The battery's down and {disfmarker} maybe {vocalsound} , I dunno , solar charged ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nProject Manager:How far away is your television ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not {disfmarker} doesn't have to go that far ,\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , the thing is uh you you don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nUser Interface:That's true .\nMarketing:Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the {disfmarker} put the telephone down , and go into the other room . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:How about Bluetooth ? {gap} Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nIndustrial Designer:Why not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nMarketing:Isn't that a better signal ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you {gap} you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nIndustrial Designer:and I'm I'm not sure it's {disfmarker} you're gonna use it .\nMarketing:Mm {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:You know we don't need it .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you {disfmarker} if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:you are gonna {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . It's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'S just an idea .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Do you need the border ?\nUser Interface:Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound} Sorry .\nUser Interface:Technical {gap} . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , so , while this is warming up ,\nMarketing:Adjusting .\nUser Interface:there it is uh .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So I'm doing the user interface design .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . {gap} we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm yeah .\nUser Interface:Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that {vocalsound} seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you {disfmarker} uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um {vocalsound} freeze frame .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see {vocalsound} what's possible to do ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nProject Manager:Great .\nUser Interface:And I {disfmarker} judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So uh , yeah , that's me .\nProject Manager:Great . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units {gap} stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another {disfmarker} {gap} exists {gap} like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:That was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with {disfmarker} in in all my years in in the remote business .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that {gap} a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} I would say it's {disfmarker} If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . 'Kay .\nProject Manager:it's {gap} like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred {vocalsound} well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nUser Interface:Mm {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm .\nUser Interface:Right . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nProject Manager:We put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nUser Interface:I think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control {disfmarker} well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Well yeah these , I think , we can {disfmarker} so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Because we need {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Great .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nProject Manager:Okay , fantastic .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Right , well done , Gabriel .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nMarketing:Where does it go into ?\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nMarketing:Here ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:The blue thing .\nUser Interface:Uh , yeah , this is getting all {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nMarketing:Well , function F_ eight . No {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it just takes a second uh .\nMarketing:oh . {vocalsound} Come on . Right . Okay . {gap} . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave {disfmarker} so this is research {disfmarker} and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um {vocalsound} current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like {disfmarker} like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um {gap} per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\nProject Manager:'Cause we've only got five channels . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} {vocalsound} exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's another thing . {vocalsound} Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:I think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nUser Interface:Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also {disfmarker} remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Wow .\nMarketing:Um personal preferences . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You are a child of technology , aren't you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um so yeah um {vocalsound} I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um {vocalsound} has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find {vocalsound} , so I don't know whether maybe {disfmarker} and also we asked them whether they wanted {vocalsound} {disfmarker} whether they'd be interested in um {vocalsound} voice activating .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five {disfmarker} this is age , sorry , {gap} age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two {disfmarker} ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nProject Manager:So there you go , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nUser Interface:No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nProject Manager:It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent {gap} say no , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not {gap} sort of {disfmarker} most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , that would be my guess as well .\nProject Manager:uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nMarketing:So they don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} d and tha\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and that's a {vocalsound} that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nMarketing:These guys are growing up . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I mean , okay , there's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Voice activation might not be the best .\nProject Manager:I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nMarketing:Um also with um with buttons , {vocalsound} a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nMarketing:Huh ?\nUser Interface:or like from doing {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't {disfmarker} I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well {vocalsound} maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So y so it's so it's so you got {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:maybe not so hard .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:see {vocalsound} have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Let's jus {gap}\nMarketing:Maybe {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:we just want {disfmarker} need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nUser Interface:Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} They're having a lunch break at the moment , but {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:I'll see if I can get {disfmarker} see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I think we can do some really {disfmarker} in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:or we just like flat buttons , something . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So that is me .\nProject Manager:That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . {vocalsound} Um okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:It's gotta be cheap . S um .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . {vocalsound} But a in {disfmarker} there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . Um anyone have any questions ? Everybody happy in their work ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it seems like we're all on the {disfmarker} pretty much on the same page .\nProject Manager:Now {gap} this is good , we've got a good structure going on . We all know where we're going to . {vocalsound} Have you been ge has {disfmarker} have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ?\nUser Interface:Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , just questionnaires .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Sell {disfmarker} trying to sell your things {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , {gap} stuff .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um okay . Do {disfmarker} oh {gap} have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ?\nMarketing:Yeah , you can .\nProject Manager:Right . Do all you all know my e-mail address ?\nUser Interface:Okay . No I don't . I {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think .\nMarketing:I think he's participant one , aren't you ?\nIndustrial Designer:So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker} Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:You have them i you have them ,\nUser Interface:Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but we'll send you an e-mail .\nProject Manager:Send me , yeah\nIndustrial Designer:You want to have friends , don't you ?\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as {gap} maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white {disfmarker} with yellow borders .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Maybe that's {vocalsound} like getting ahead of ourselves .\nProject Manager:Well , maybe you can come up with a few {disfmarker} with a couple of different ideas ?\nIndustrial Designer:It wouldn't be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col\nProject Manager:Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image .\nMarketing:like does it have to be of a certain ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:It's gotta say {disfmarker} people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction ,\nProject Manager:There's loads of companies that called R_R_ .\nMarketing:like if it had a symbol on it .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:This is slog {gap} but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type .\nMarketing:Whoa .\nUser Interface:And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them .\nMarketing:So we have to have it one colour .\nProject Manager:Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it .\nUser Interface:Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Not necessarily even if i it just has to {disfmarker} ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products\nIndustrial Designer:Well you could {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:It's got to {disfmarker} so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps .\nIndustrial Designer:It could come {disfmarker} But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:If {gap} .\nProject Manager:Quite poss yeah . Well this is all your department . Mm okay . Well , well done everybody .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now .\nUser Interface:Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now .\nMarketing:Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ?\nProject Manager:We might possibly have done .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nUser Interface:Alright , see you all soon .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} 'Kay uh .\nProject Manager:Yeah , there you go .

        "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Janet Finch-Saunders. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Suzy Davies to the committee, and to thank Mark Reckless and Darren Millar, who have left us, for their service and hard work as members of the committee. Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We will move on then to our evidence session on our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, and Eluned Morgan AM, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning. Can I just ask you to introduce your officials for the record, please?\nKirsty Williams AM:Bore da, Lynne, and thank you for the invitation to join you. Eluned and I are joined this morning by Huw Morris, who's the group director at SHELL\u2014skills, higher education and lifelong learning\u2014and Marie Knox, who is deputy director, overseeing European transition.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you very much, and thank you for coming. We'll go straight into questions, then, and the first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you. I'd like to ask you both, if that's okay, a little bit about preparedness. But if I could start with higher education, I understand that\u2014I don't know, it must be about 18 months ago now\u2014Ken Skates told another committee in this place that there had been nine sector analyses done. Presumably, one of those was HE, because of the\u2014well, Welsh Government had a presence, and still does, in Brussels, related to higher education. Apparently, those have now been superseded by work that's been done by Cardiff University. I don't know if you've got any comments on that research, or whether it's been brought to your attention yet.\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, Suzy, following the vote, I was very keen that we work very closely with colleagues in higher education and further education, to get an understanding from on the ground about the potential impact. So, in terms of preparedness, we started that group in the September, and that work from that group, which includes both HE and FE, has been instrumental in helping the Government form its views, which were articulated in the Government's White Paper, 'Securing Wales' Future'. There has been ongoing work being done\u2014as the debate in London and Europe becomes a little bit more clear, then it becomes a little less clear, and then a little bit more clear, but, bearing in mind the difficulties of working in an ever-changing field, we have been refining those approaches. Each institution has been looking at their own institution, because, as you can imagine, although we have an overview of the sector, the challenges are very different for individual institutions\u2014so their exposure, for instance, to the number of European Union students that they have at their college, or the work that they might be doing with Horizon 2020, or their success\u2014and there has been considerable success in the HE field in securing structural funds for various projects\u2014the exposure and the potential impact of leaving the EU, in a 'no deal' or in a 'deal' scenario, is very, very different. But I don't know if, Huw, you want to talk any further.\nSuzy Davies AM:Maybe just to use the 'no deal' scenario is probably the easiest,\u00a0isn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM:The 'no deal'?\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, yes, because that's the worst-case scenario, so let's look at that one.\nHuw Morris:As the Cabinet\u00a0Secretary mentioned, the higher education Brexit working group's\u00a0been meeting since September 2016 and has been looking at that in general. More recently, when the prospect of no deal became talked about, officials have been visiting individual institutions to talk to them about their preparedness for that. As you'll be aware, the funding for much of the activity is secured, we believe, even under a 'no deal' scenario, until December 2020; that's a letter we had from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I think the research you're referring to may be research that Cardiff University has been doing with the Bevan\u00a0Foundation and others. I know there's a report due to be launched later today. We have been doing our own research and looking at the impact on HE, FE and apprenticeship providers.\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, that's really helpful because my understanding was that this Cardiff University research\u00a0had superseded all those nine sector analyses.\nHuw Morris:That may be true for the economy brief. Certainly, there are published papers by Max Munday and a team at Cardiff University on the impact of Brexit on the Welsh economy, but for HE and FE and apprenticeship provision, it's as the Cabinet Secretary\u00a0outlined.\nSuzy Davies AM:So, are there any formal risk assessments that are available for us to scrutinise, for example? For HE and FE\u00a0for that matter.\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales have been doing some specific work; I can't comment on how wide they would want that to be shared. We have been doing some broad analysis, as I said, for the sector, looking at what we can do to mitigate the risk, bearing in mind that each institution is an autonomous institution, a principle that they guard really jealously, and rightly so. So, we have been, as Huw said, because the prospect of a 'no deal' has become, perhaps, more to the forefront, officers have been visiting each institution to try and make sure and to satisfy us, as people who fund part of their activity, that they have their own plans in place to deal with these scenarios. We continue to work alongside them to push the issues that we can help them with. So, for instance, we continue to work with officials in Westminster around Erasmus+ provision in a 'no deal' scenario, what a UK stand-alone project would look like, the impacts of a 'no deal' on Horizon 2020. So, we look at the broader picture and we are encouraging continually individual institutions to make sure that they themselves are looking at their specific needs within that.\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, if there is something that's shareable, I'm sure we'd be very pleased to see it\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM:Anything that we've got\u2014\nSuzy Davies AM:\u2014particularly with FE, actually, because, of course, we haven't got a\u00a0HEFCW\u00a0for FE; you're doing that regulation yourself. I'd expect to see that type of work evidenced somewhere from within Welsh Government, and we would be able to see that then.\nEluned Morgan AM:So, if I could just make some points on FE. We've been actively engaging with the FE sector. We've spoken to every one of the colleges about how they see things developing. I think it's quite a different response than what is going to be\u00a0happening in HE.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, because the student thing isn't such an issue, is it?\nEluned Morgan AM:You've got to remember that the FE colleges are much more anchored within their\u00a0communities, they're much more localised, and so, for example, the number of EU students in these colleges is significantly lower. The number of staff in these colleges\u2014I think they've analysed that there are only about 71 people. So, we're keeping in touch with them and we're letting them know what we are being told in terms of the Home Office settled status and what we can do to protect those 71. But that's\u00a0a much bigger issue, I think, for higher education.\nSuzy Davies AM:What are they telling you about European social fund\u00a0funding, though, because, as you say, they're locally anchored\u2014the impact on FE of ESF funding is probably more significant than the issues we're talking about with higher education. How are you finding this out? Is this through one-to-one conversations?\nEluned Morgan AM:We are engaging with them all, and, obviously, we're engaging with ColegauCymru, who've done their own analysis, and what we found, in particular, is that the real problems are probably in relation to ESF funding and apprenticeships. But what you've got to remember is that that link between apprenticeships and the local work community is absolutely crucial. So, if\u2014\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, that's why I asked.\nEluned Morgan AM:\u2014the economy nosedives, or if there's an issue that we see\u2014just the dislocation of companies in those areas as a result of Brexit\u2014then that will inevitably have an impact on the number of apprenticeships that will be on offer. So, it's those kinds of things, but at the moment I think it's worth pointing out that about \u00a315 million a year goes into the FE sector just in relation to apprenticeships.\nSuzy Davies AM:Can I just come back finally on that, before handing over? In both your areas of responsibility, there's going to be an impact on Welsh Government in how it responds to that, as well. Can you tell me a little bit about the European transition team, which I think is about building resilience within the Welsh Government to deal with the impacts of Brexit? Is that a formal arrangement you have with officials? I don't really know much about this team, but it seems to meet fortnightly to get Welsh Government ready for Brexit, so could you just give us some clues on this?\nMarie Knox:Yes, in terms of the European transition team, that's the central co-ordinating group that pulls together all the leads in each department who are pulling together the work on European transition. So, I attend that group in relation to higher education and further education, and, obviously, other representatives in terms of agriculture, transport, the economy, et cetera.\nSuzy Davies AM:It's great that you're on that group, but what does it actually do? That's the bit I wasn't sure about.\nMarie Knox:I guess it provides the governance structure for the Welsh Government as a whole in relation to European transition. So, individual departments do their own work, and the European transition team provides the governance structure, and, also, they lead on the discussions with the Department for Exiting the European Union, No.\u00a010, the Joint Ministerial Committee\u2014those kinds of ministerial arrangements.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you. I've had enough time, I think.\nLynne Neagle AM:Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:I'll ask my questions in Welsh, if I may. This discussion between HEFCW and higher education, these challenges in terms of how ready they are for the changes to come, and the work that the Government is doing with FE, I suspect, is happening\u00a0at an organisational level. So, I just want to hear a little about where the student voice comes into that discussion and where the engagement happens in terms of the students.\nKirsty Williams AM:So, we have a close working relationship with the National Union of Students. I meet with them regularly, and officials are in constant touch with the student voice. They have been very clear, and I think there is a huge amount of consensus between the Welsh Government, what the universities are asking for and what the students are asking for. You'll have seen, only earlier this week, the very powerful campaign by NUS Wales about the importance of Erasmus+ arrangements. There is a huge amount to be gained for Welsh students and young people participating in the Erasmus programme. Many of us, I know, have had the opportunity to study abroad as part of our own studies, and there's a lot to be gained from it. We've been very clear from the outset, as have the sector and the student voice, about the importance of participation in that scheme.  NUS are also very concerned that there should be no negative impact on the quality of faculty. Our HE institutions, to a greater extent than FE, have faculty staff from the EU\u2014it runs at about 11 per cent. That adds great diversity and strength to the quality of teaching within our institutions. Clearly, that is a concern for students. They want to have the best teachers, they want access to the best learning opportunities, and we've been very clear about the importance of providing security and stability for those staff, making sure we send very clear messages that they're very welcome and we value their contribution. NUS, again, also value the diversity in the student population. Again, as far as we've been able to, we've been able to give messages about the security of funding for European students for the next academic year. I wish I could go further, but that's out of my hands. We're working to the limits of what I feel comfortable in being able to guarantee without further guarantees from Westminster. So, we've been working closely with the student voice, and I think, Llyr,\u00a0what's very clear is there is a consensus about what is important across the Government, the institutions and student voice. So, that is making sure we send very clear messages about Wales's institutions being open for business and that we welcome both EU and international students, that we value the contribution of faculty, and that we want to be able to continue in Horizon 2020. That's especially important if\u00a0we're looking at attracting postgraduate work and postgraduate students into our system, as well as Erasmus+. The issue of post-study work visas, again, is very important. As I said, there's a consensus, I think, between the Government, the institutions and the students about what we need the UK Government to achieve for us.\nLynne Neagle AM:Before we move on to student recruitment, it's increasingly the view of many experts that we're heading for a 'no deal' Brexit. Can I ask both of you what specific\u00a0plans you've put in place in the event of such a 'no deal' Brexit happening and us crashing out next spring?\nEluned Morgan AM:Well, I think it's really difficult for us to prepare for a 'no deal' Brexit, but obviously we need to think through very carefully what that might look like, and I think that scenario planning is starting to happen. I think it's very different, again, for FE compared to HE. So, in relation to FE, what we do have is funding\u2014ESF funding\u2014which the UK Government has said that they will underwrite until 2020. So, in March next year, if there is no deal, the immediate impact on FE is unlikely to hit in the way that we may have feared. The problem then becomes: what exactly is the deal with the EU in future, because we will have some kind of relationship, and what that impact will be on the broader economy and our ability to work with companies locally, and industries, to provide that link between training needs? So, the colleges, basically, are providing the training for lots of the apprenticeships, and so if the number of companies reduces, then that is likely to have an impact. So, there are specific sectors that we are more concerned about than others. Farming is obviously one that we are concerned about, because that could have a difference in terms of day one of no deal. If your markets are not there, that could be quite an immediate impact. Health and social care\u2014obviously, we are concerned that there are a number of people who work in that sector who are EU citizens. What is the impact? Are they going to feel unwelcome? Are they likely, then, to return home? Where will that skills gap, therefore, be? So, that's a problem for us. Construction is already an issue for us in terms of skills shortages. So, one of the things we're doing is we've developed these regional skills partnerships where we ask local employers, 'What is it that you need in terms of skills development?' and we are now asking further education colleges to respond to that need. So, rather than them just getting people through the college system, who are easy to get in because they're doing courses that they're excited about, let's try and encourage them to do courses where we know there are skills shortages. So, that is a new structure that we've developed that is already having an impact; there's a \u00a310 million project there. So, we're already putting things in place for those situations. In manufacturing, obviously, if there's no deal, the rules of origin, that could have an immediate impact. Just-in-time\u2014we could have real problems in terms of dislocation there; and hospitality and tourism. So, those are the sectors we have most concerns about, and all of them have very strong links to the FE sector.\nKirsty Williams AM:From the HE perspective, from a point of principle, we just have to keep working towards some kind of deal. Although the prospect of no deal, maybe, has risen up the agenda, we have got to be consistent in our messages to the Westminster Government: we need a deal. Wales cannot afford to crash out of the EU without a deal. If that worst-case scenario was to happen, because of the underwrite guarantee, actually, for European regional development fund and European social fund programmes in the HE sector, it would be business as usual. And because of the current underwrite guarantee, the forthcoming bids for Erasmus and Horizon 2020 would be covered, but they would be the last applications that could be made. You'll be aware that there are some proposals for an extension to that guarantee, but from my understanding and our understanding of it, that would only give us third-country status for Horizon 2020 and Erasmus. What that does mean is that we would have limited access to the Horizon 2020 programme, and if you look at the activity that is currently being undertaken by the Welsh HE sector under that programme, that would mean that we'd probably lose about 50 per cent of that work, because that's the split between the bits we would still be able to access and what we are currently accessing. As I've already said, we have made a guarantee for EU student support for the next academic year, but, without clarity from the Treasury, I don't think it would be prudent of me to commit Welsh Government to anything further than that. So, we continue to push the message that a 'no deal' would be catastrophic. What can we do? You'll be aware that we have been working with Universities Wales to access resources under the European transition fund, under the Global Wales programme, to look to boost international marketing of the HE sector and to talk about the strengths that we have in the sector. And we continue to look at other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to assist the universities and the FE sector in that regard. We also continue to look to respond to the Reid review proposals, about how we can beef up our own research and continue to engage with UK Research and Innovation to make sure that, with any research money that comes out of that negotiation, Wales is in a competitive position to be able to bid successfully for that.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. We're going to move on, then, to talk about student recruitment. I'm going to, because we've got a lot of questions, appeal for brief questions and answers that are as concise as possible, please. Hefin.\nHefin David AM:How does the Welsh Government account for the fact that EU student applications in Wales this year\u2014that Wales is the only country in the UK to have seen a significant drop?\nKirsty Williams AM:Okay, well, I think the first thing to remember is that we will not get a full picture of student recruitment until, first of all, November and then the true picture, because some institutions, as you would know, have two admissions dates\u2014we won't get the full picture until the spring. I think it was inevitable, given the change in Government policy with regard to student support, which had previously allowed European students to benefit from a tuition fee grant, and given the fact that that option is no longer available to them, that that has had an impact on EU recruitment, and there's no point trying to hide from that.\nHefin David AM:So, together with leaving the EU, that's a double-whammy effect that's hitting Wales harder than the rest of the UK.\nKirsty Williams AM:It just puts us in the same position as EU students applying to England, but it was inevitable. This was looked at by Diamond. It was anticipated that this could be a consequence of the change in policy, and I think we see that reflected in the initial figure, although, as I said, we won't get the true picture until the first census in November, and then, ultimately, the final picture in the spring.\nHefin David AM:How concerned are you by that?\nKirsty Williams AM:Clearly, we want our universities to be able to attract students from both the EU and from around the world. The fact that the tuition fee grant arrangements may have had an impact on European Union students at this stage does not preclude the fact that Wales, up until now, has been successful in recruiting international students. So, the change in the fee regime should not be a barrier to the recruitment of international students, because, actually, international students outside of the EU make up a bigger proportion of students not from the UK who come to our institutions.\nHefin David AM:That's a fair point, but it's unfortunate timing, though, isn't it?\nKirsty Williams AM:I think, from a public policy point of view and moving towards a sustainable way of funding our HE sector, then both my priority and, I would say, the priority of the institutions was to see the implementation of Diamond, which is what we have done.\nHefin David AM:Okay, that's fine. What about the fact that we've got a relatively imbalanced higher education profile compared to other countries of the UK with regard to high, medium and low-tariff universities? We've got one high-tariff university, and they're the ones that tend to show the growth in recruitment of EU students. Are you concerned about that balance of profile in the HE sector?\nKirsty Williams AM:As I said in answer to your question earlier, there is a difference reflected in the exposure of institutions to EU and international students. I would argue that it's not necessarily the case that institutions that are not high-tariff are not able to do very well in this sector.\u00a0If you look, for instance, at Swansea University\u2014if you look at the work Swansea\u00a0University has done, that shows you what is possible.\nHefin David AM:What is Swansea's success, then? What can we learn from Swansea?\nKirsty Williams AM:What I think is important\u2014and this is not about any one institution\u2014what I think is really important is that we look to\u2014. And I can't force institutions\u00a0to do this. It's a combination, I believe, for all universities, of getting their offer right\u2014so, having a curriculum at their institution that is attractive and offers courses that people want to study. It's about that curriculum being delivered in an excellent fashion, so high quality\u00a0ratings for teaching, as well as having an infrastructure\u00a0that is attractive to students. So, it's all about getting the offer right and providing what students, both domestically and internationally, want.\nHefin David AM:But the evidence would therefore suggest that that model of success that you've just outlined is happening in Swansea but it isn't happening in other institutions, and they're seeing a drop.\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, as I said, I think what we can see from Cardiff, Swansea and others is that it is possible to do very well in the sector.\nHefin David AM:So, Cardiff, Swansea and Bangor\u2014but the others, not.\nKirsty Williams AM:As I said, what we can see is that, if you get the offer right, I think we have something very special that the HE sector can market itself on.\nLynne Neagle AM:Llyr, you've got a supplementary.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Just coming back to the drop in EU students, you mentioned that one of the reasons probably is the change in the funding that's available to students coming here. So, does that suggest that, under the current regime, Wales was punching above its weight in terms of attracting students and we've lost that advantage? I know we're gaining in other ways in introducing\u00a0the new system, but really we're not much different to England in terms of fees now, so why would they come to Wales as opposed to going anywhere else?\nKirsty Williams AM:I think you're right; there was an added incentive, potentially, to come to a Welsh\u00a0institution because\u00a0of the availability of the tuition\u00a0fee grant. That advantage is no longer there, which is why we need to work alongside the sector, as we're doing with the Global Wales programme, to increase their ability to market HE in the round across the world. I think we've got a strong offer that we can speak to people about. I'm very proud of what our institutions can deliver for people. It's a fantastic, warm environment to come and study in, at great institutions. There's something for everybody, whether you want to be in a city like Cardiff or whether you want a coastal experience in a small town like Aber. So, we've got a lot to offer and that's why it's really important that, although we have seen a change in the tuition\u00a0fees, which may have an impact, we are investing with universities, for instance, in the Global Wales programme.\nLynne Neagle AM:In terms of the drop that we've seen in Wales, which is differential amongst\u00a0institutions, will you be taking any specific action to try and prevent Brexit exacerbating\u00a0that?\nKirsty Williams AM:We are working with HEFCW and individual\u00a0institutions, as I said, to test their preparedness. We can't tell them what to do in that sense, but we can, because of our governance arrangements and HEFCW's monitoring arrangements, continue to test with them. I meet regularly\u00a0with vice-chancellors and separately\u00a0with the chairs of the institutions and separately\u00a0again with HEFCW representatives, and the sustainability\u00a0of the sector and recruitment issues is always something that is on the agenda.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Julie.\nJulie Morgan AM:The additional \u00a36.4 million that went to HEFCW in the 2017-18 year, which I think you say is partly because\u00a0of Brexit and partly because of demographic and recruitment challenges, what do you expect to see as a result of that spending?\nKirsty Williams AM:That funding was allocated, as I said, to enable HEFCW to deal with any short-term implications arising out of demographic changes, because\u00a0we've seen a drop in the number of 18-year-olds, and the initial implications of EU transition. It was allocated as part of HEFCW's overall grant in aid, and therefore the council was given discretion as to how it was to be apportioned to the sector. The money was brought forward\u00a0a year, because, in conversations with HEFCW and the institutions, they felt that that money\u00a0would be more useful earlier on. So, it was money that was brought forward into the allocation for 2017-18, as opposed\u00a0to 2018-19, because\u00a0they wanted\u00a0to have that resource earlier rather than later. With regard to\u00a0additional resources, you'll be aware that we have made an additional resource of \u00a35 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees, and \u00a35 million has been made available to HEFCW to kick-start the work on postgraduate support until we're in a position to fully implement Diamond at the postgraduate level.\nJulie Morgan AM:You say that the money is used at the discretion of the universities. So, you don't have an analysis of how that was spent.\nKirsty Williams AM:The financial allocation, as I said, was agreed with the funding council and it was there to help universities with any cash flow issues, but if you'd like further details I can provide those as much as I'm able.\nJulie Morgan AM:I think it would be interesting if we know what the money was spent on and, of course, that money is now not available for the next financial year, so there's no way of carrying on what they were doing with it, presumably.\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, as I said, it was part of the overall allocation to HEFCW. With specific regard to dealing with the impact of Brexit, you'll be aware that we have reached an agreement in principle on the funding of \u00a33.5 million to the Global Wales initiative. This was an application that came in from Universities Wales looking at specifically targeting and beefing up international work and international recruitment work to support them at this time, and we're currently working with Universities Wales on the exact details and outcomes they would expect from that investment.\nJulie Morgan AM:And do you have any estimate of how many students you hope to attract by that?\nKirsty Williams AM:That is subject to continuing negotiations with Universities Wales before we let any contracts with them. What's important is that that work is based on research that has been done by Universities Wales to look at the optimum markets that we should be targeting, specifically the United States of America and Vietnam.\nJulie Morgan AM:And will this money be used equally between all the universities?\nKirsty Williams AM:We expect that all institutions\u2014should they have a desire to participate\u2014will be able to be assisted, as well as the overall global branding from Universities Wales and the new Study in Wales initiative.\nJulie Morgan AM:Thank you. I think we've covered the EU student fees, haven't we?\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Do you want to ask question 12?\nJulie Morgan AM:Has the Welsh Government explored the possibility of looking at different immigration rules for international and EU students who may wish to study here?\nKirsty Williams AM:Okay. Well, with regard to immigration, clearly, this is something, at the moment, that is out of our hands, and I have to say, it hasn't got off to a great start when initially the post-study work visas were issued just for a number of institutions in the south-east of England, with no consultation with us and I don't believe with the Scottish Government either. So, we have campaigned, pushed, cajoled, lobbied, and I was very glad that in December last year, the Home Office did then make that scheme available to Cardiff and to Trinity Saint David. We continue to press the point that we do not believe that, first of all, international students should be included in any immigration targets. I think all the evidence suggests that the British public don't regard international students as immigrants, and therefore we do need to make sure that they are taken out of the targets and we can continue to press that message with the UK Government. At the moment, you'll be aware that Welsh Government has looked at a specific piece of work on whether there was any scope for specific immigration policy for Wales, although I must say that was mostly in the field of actually the workforce rather than students. You'll be aware that this week the Government's migration advisory committee\u2014there are so many committees these days\u2014have said that they don't believe that there is a case for a separate provision for EU students, as opposed to international students. But we want an immigration system that makes it as easy as possible for those students who want to benefit from education in Wales, and indeed the UK, to be able to do so.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:So, what are we doing from now on in then? Are we just waiting to see or are we continuing to push?\nKirsty Williams AM:No\u2014gosh\u2014Llyr, we continue to push the case\u00a0at the official level, and at the moment, I'm trying to convene a quadrilateral, if it can be quadrilateral in the sense\u00a0that Northern Ireland\u00a0aren't up and running\u2014but certainly with officials from Northern Ireland. We're trying to arrange another quadrilateral between myself, the HE Minister for England and the new HE Minister for Scotland. If I can speak candidly, I don't believe\u00a0that there's any difference between our view, with regard to the status of international students, and the views of English Ministers within the department in England. It is convincing the Home Office of that case. So, I don't think we need to persuade\u00a0Sam Gyimah about the importance of this. Jo Johnson got, I think the current Minister gets it\u2014it's a question\u00a0of whether we can persuade the Home Office\u00a0of that particular case.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. The next questions are from John Griffiths.\nJohn Griffiths AM:I have some questions on the sustainability\u00a0of higher and further education. Firstly, with regard to higher education, we heard that, even without Brexit, higher education\u00a0is in managed deficit, whilst the funding announcements from Diamond and Reid are awaited. So, is that a concern to Welsh Government, and could Welsh Government\u00a0take away that uncertainty by outlining a clear funding commitment to the Diamond and Reid reviews?\nKirsty Williams AM:Welsh Government is fully committed, John, to implementing the Diamond review proposals. It's a commitment\u00a0that was an element of the agreement between myself and the First Minister that\u00a0brought me into the administration, and we have been very clear with HEFCW about our expectations and what the implementation of Diamond will mean for grant going to HEFCW. And we've shared those figures\u00a0with them. With regard to Reid, we continue within Government to discuss how we can implement the recommendations of Reid, but one of the whole principles behind Diamond was to move us to a more sustainable funding settlement\u00a0for the HE sector in the round, that is fair to students, encourages those with the ability to partake in higher education\u00a0to do so, especially from those from a poorer background, as well as being able to provide our institutions\u00a0with the resources that they need.\nJohn Griffiths AM:So, you don't accept, then, that there hasn't been a clear funding commitment\u00a0from Welsh Government to those reviews\u2014the Diamond and\u00a0Reid reviews?\nKirsty Williams AM:With regard to Diamond, I would absolutely refute that. We have been very clear and\u00a0we have shown HEFCW our analysis of the figures going forward in relation to what is sometimes called within the sector the 'Diamond dividend', although the Diamond dividend is never as big as people imagine the\u00a0Diamond dividend to be. But we've\u00a0been absolutely\u00a0clear with HEFCW and the sector on what that will mean. Now, with regard to Reid, those are ongoing discussions\u00a0that form part of the normal budgetary\u00a0process within\u00a0the Government, but I think we have been as clear as we can be with regard to Diamond.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. The second question, really, is about HE and FE and it's about European funding, which, of course, has been\u00a0and is on a multi-year basis, which gives, I think, a lot of security and comfort to the sectors, knowing what the budgets will be over a period of time. So, moving from that to a yearly budgeting situation would be worrying. So, would you commit\u00a0to introducing multi-year funding\u00a0settlements\u00a0for HE, and indeed for FE, moving forward beyond Brexit?\nEluned Morgan AM:Shall I take this and give you a little bit of a break? She's not very well. I think the multi-annual nature of the European funding programmes has been very, very useful. People can plan, you can get staffing in place, you can have really strategic aims and I think that's really useful for the institutions involved. Of course, what we don't have is multi-annual budgeting from the UK Government. So, whilst\u00a0I think we would, in an ideal world, like to see a better view of what's coming our way, it's extremely\u00a0difficult for us to be able to offer that without having that\u00a0multi-annual funding commitment from the UK Government. So, I think that will be a major, major loss for the institutions concerned. Of course, it's not just about ESF and apprenticeships\u2014it's also about ERDF funding. So, you mustn't forget that, actually, there's been a lot of ERDF funding that's gone into these institutions. Swansea University, you'll be aware, has been practically rebuilt with ERDF. Also, FE colleges\u2014we've got Coleg y Cymoedd, the college in Blaenau Gwent. These have been built, largely, with European funding. It's because of the multi-annual nature of the fact that we've been able to prepare for them that they have been able to progress. So, that will be a huge loss, but I think it's really important that we don't forget the ERDF aspect in addition to the ESF impact that there will be on these institutions.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. As far as further education is concerned, in your paper you state that it's a priority to support the FE sector to maintain all the learning opportunities that currently take place under European Union funding. So, would you be able to give the committee an idea of the level of resource you would estimate that the sector requires to achieve that priority, and\u2014? I'll stop there for the moment.\nEluned Morgan AM:I think it is important. What we've said is that we want to maintain that range of learning opportunities that is provided by EU funding. I think we've got to be clear that we are not working to this scenario. I think we've got to\u2014. The UK Government have made us some promises and they've made some commitments, and we need to hold them to that, and so let's keep the pressure on. The moment we start saying, 'No, it's all going to be okay, we'll sort ourselves out'\u2014I think that would be a huge mistake. We have been promised that we will not lose a penny as a result of Brexit, and we need to make sure that we keep them to that commitment. I think it was quite interesting to hear what Philip Hammond said yesterday when he was in Wales, saying that the money that we will receive will depend on the future shape of the economy, which implies that he has no idea what's going to happen there, and that that shared prosperity fund will be designed around the deal. Well, that's really not what we're interested in. We were made some promises, and we need them to commit to those promises. I think we have some real concerns about the shared prosperity fund not really following through on the commitments that were made during the Brexit referendum. But, in terms of the replacements, we'd be looking at about \u00a315 million a year, and that would be a huge impact for us, but we're not looking at that\u2014I don't think we should be\u2014because they made some promises.\nJohn Griffiths AM:So, could you say that, if they keep their promises, then at least that level of funding would be maintained?\nEluned Morgan AM:I think that would be a minimum, but that's just one aspect of it. That's not including the whole workplace learning money on top of that.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Suzy, you had a supplementary.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, just very quickly on the multi-annual point, obviously I recognise that we're talking about six or seven-year cycles with Europe, and I completely take the point that you don't really know from year to year what your budget's going to be, but Welsh Government does make multi-annual commitments. I think you did it yesterday, actually\u2014the capital commitment is over more than one year. How are you able to do that and yet not quite feel confident that you can do that with\u2014well, both your sectors, really?\nEluned Morgan AM:I think it's probably easier to do with capital than it is with revenue, so that's what would make the difference. But it's\u2014. These institutions are interested in revenue, because that's what supports the staff. The one thing we all know is that employment opportunities today\u2014the transitional nature of employment and the fact that people are not getting the kind of contracts that we'd like them to get\u2014that makes their lives very precarious and they're less likely, then, to be committed to those institutions. I think it's a really, really concerning thing, because what makes these institutions work well is their staff, so that makes life very, very difficult without that multi-annual commitment.\nSuzy Davies AM:They also have to raise some of their own money as well\u2014we mustn't forget that.\nEluned Morgan AM:No, I think that's right, and I think that there's more that these institutions can do in terms of their own funding and being more responsive to employers and the need for skills in their areas.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:So, given the precarious state of planning for the finances, are you considering letting universities charge EU students international fees?\nKirsty Williams AM:We don't regulate the ability for universities to set fees for international students. They would be in a position to\u2014[Inaudible.] They are in a position to set international fees at a rate that, I guess, they feel is appropriate for the provision that they give to those students.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, right. We'll move on, then, to questions from Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Thank you. I just wanted to pick up on the funding of apprenticeships and the long-term funding, because the ESF\u2014the commitments take us to 2023, which takes us beyond any transition period. So, I just want to hear from you that there are assurances that the apprenticeship programme can be delivered as a whole, come what may.\nEluned Morgan AM:Well, we're fine until 2020, because we've had that guarantee from the Government. The issue for us is the n+2 that we would have if we do have some kind of transition deal or an agreement with the EU. So, there is a risk and there is concern, beyond 2020, that that would create problems if they don't agree to fund that, which is the expectation that we have.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:But it is a prospect that this wouldn't be achieved as you foresee.\nEluned Morgan AM:Well, we do hope, because we've had the pledges and commitments from the Government, that they will respect what we expected and what was expected by these institutions that have had the commitment of the funding.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:So, to what extent does that undermine the current work? Because institutions want to enter into agreements with providers and so on. Businesses want to know, if they're starting on some sort of journey, that they are going to get to the end of it some years down the line. That must be undermining a lot of the work that's going on now.\nEluned Morgan AM:Well, as I said, because the guarantee is there until 2020, I think that, for now, people are willing to go into those agreements, and I hope that we'll have a better outlook by November of the direction we're moving in. But I don't think it's had an impact. You have to remember that the number of apprenticeships in Wales is rising, while they've collapsed entirely in England. So, it is important that we do continue, and it's important that we don't create an atmosphere here that's going to undermine the confidence of our employers in committing to training in the workplace.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Are you confident that the Government will achieve its targets in this context?\nEluned Morgan AM:Yes. We're on target to reach 100,000 apprenticeships. I think we're slightly ahead of that target, I'm pleased to say. So, of course, our hope is to do that. But let's be clear: if there is a 'no deal' scenario, that will have an impact on the economy, and who knows what will happen then to some of these companies that are reliant on the EU.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Talking about the impact on the wider economy, on the point you made earlier that it's not just the direct effect on these institutions, but also on the businesses that they engage with, that is a concern in this context, that means, of course, that there is a lot of pressure in this context on the work that other departments in the Government are doing, because perhaps they are the ones dealing with some of this. So, could you tell us a little bit about how you're working with Ministers and Cabinet Secretaries and other departments within the Government to safeguard these interests?\nEluned Morgan AM:So, as part of the employability programme, I have started going round every member of the Cabinet to ask what the impact will be on them\u2014for example, in health, and, certainly, the economy, but here are many other areas. What's important for us is that we do collaborate and we do get this analysis, but we hope to do that on the ground through the regional skills partnerships. That's our way of ensuring that we can have an understanding, on the ground, of what's needed by employers. And so ensuring that people feed into that and that we respond to those requirements\u2014that's where we're focusing our work. So, we're asking, for example, health boards to ensure that they feed into the regional skills partnerships.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Is there a danger that we're a little bit behind in this process? Because Brexit could be upon us in no time at all, and, of course, this work is still ongoing.\nEluned Morgan AM:Well, I have been pushing and ensuring that in the direct areas facing the greatest risk, and agriculture's one of those, of course\u2014. We have been pushing to see what we can do further, so, for example, I'm in the process of developing a policy on rural skills at present because I do think it's important that we do focus on those sectors that are likely to suffer the worst impact if the worst does happen. So, those preparations are in place as far as they can be, but, of course, it's very difficult without knowing to what extent it's going to impact on us.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:And each sector's running on its own timescale, I would presume. But, as you've mentioned rural skills, when do you foresee that that work will appear, and when will plans or schemes or whatever you're intending to put in place see the light of day?\nEluned Morgan AM:Well, we hope during this term that that will be published or announced. So, certainly, it is something that we have been discussing with people in rural areas directly, with the colleges, to see what the provision is there and to what extent we need to expand that, and to what extent we will need to change and move really quickly if there is no deal. That's something that I think we have to learn and we need to convince the FE sector about in terms of moving more quickly and to be more responsive to the demand that there is in the workplace.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Yes, because there is the dilemma you touched on earlier about providing the skills that are required for the economy and providing the courses that are easy to fill. That is a live discussion across FE and HE, but you're confident that that discussion is taking place in a constructive and positive way and moving in the right direction.\nEluned Morgan AM:Well, it's helped that we've put \u00a310 million on the table, because they do understand now that we are serious about our aim of ensuring that they do respond to what employers are asking for. So that has helped a lot in terms of focus and, of course, we're in the middle of a review now as well in terms of how we fund FE, and that will certainly be a part of that.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Okay, thanks.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Can I just go back\u2014?\nKirsty Williams AM:Sorry, Chair, could I just clarify something? The last question you asked me about\u2014\nLynne Neagle AM:I was just going to go back to that, yes.\nKirsty Williams AM:\u2014fees\u2014. Sorry. Of course, that is in the context of a 'no deal' scenario. There could be a scenario where there are reciprocal arrangements, so, if a deal was reached with the European Union that established the principle of reciprocal arrangements, then, obviously, the ability of the HE institutions to charge international fees would be curtailed. I just want to make that clear.\nLynne Neagle AM:If there's not that agreement\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM:If there's no deal\u2014\nLynne Neagle AM:\u2014then it will be open to universities to charge market-driven, international rates.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, that's right. Sorry, I just wanted to clarify. I should have made it very clear that the answer I gave was in the context of no deal, which is what we seem to be talking about mostly this morning, but if there was a deal to have reciprocal arrangements, then that ability, obviously, would be curtailed.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay, well, can I thank the Cabinet Secretary, the Minister and the officials for attending and for answering all our questions? We very much appreciate your time. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy after the meeting. Thank you very much. Okay. Item 5, then, is papers to note. Members will see that there are 18 papers to note, so I'd like to suggest that we note them as a block, please, and just to flag that I would like to return to paper to note 18 when we go into private. Is that okay with everyone? Everyone happy to note those? Thank you. Item 6, then, can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and the whole of the meeting next week? Are Members content? Okay, thank you.\n",
        "summary": "The meeting was about the fiscal and social influence of Brexit, especially focusing on the Wales education system. The group was worrying that Brexit would cut down the support from the EU to the UK, thus putting the Wales Universities in great dilemma. Besides, the fact was that the less fiscal support from the EU, the less foreign students would apply for the Wales universities. The members talked about several possible solutions, for instance, adjusting the syllabus to better meet both the students' and the lecturers' needs and providing them with better career prospects. What also mattered was the immigration policy which would be alluring to the foreign students if being reconsidered carefully.",

That's okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Am I starting now ? Anytime ? Oh sorry . 'Kay , um . Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , and um , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and um {disfmarker} Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . Um , so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . And , um {disfmarker} So , sorry ? So , um , take it away Poppy .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um , do I need to {disfmarker} {gap}\nProject Manager:It's , it's plugged in . So , um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:plugged in .\nUser Interface:F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight .\nIndustrial Designer:F_ okay . Function F_ eight . Sorry about this guys .\nProject Manager:No problem .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . {gap} is on . Right . {gap} Okay . I will take this time just to apologise .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But there we go .\nProject Manager:I'm sure it's fine .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . Um , from {disfmarker} Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there . Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .\nProject Manager:Right , um , one question . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker} And then {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ?\nIndustrial Designer:You could {disfmarker} we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce ,\nProject Manager:Okay . This sounds like a really great idea .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I {disfmarker} the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . Because of this , their properties are smart material .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .\nProject Manager:Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .\nIndustrial Designer:So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Okay . Um also there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet .\nProject Manager:I'm sorry , could you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:There we go\nProject Manager:Those were um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:. Sorry , should I go back . This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So I just {gap} put all those components in .\nProject Manager:So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .\nProject Manager:Alright . Great .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay ? So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ? There we go . Okay .\nProject Manager:Alright . Thank you very much . And , um , the next presenter will be Tara .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:There you go Tara .\nUser Interface:Thanks . Can you see ?\nMarketing:Oh , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Do you think {disfmarker} Is it uh , function eight yeah ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Function F_ eight .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Function F_ eight .\nProject Manager:Function F_ eight . Sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:The one at the top .\nUser Interface:Oh right . Okay .\nMarketing:That looks right .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . I'm the User {vocalsound} um User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself .\nMarketing:Ch Oh , I see .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included . So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?\nUser Interface:Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices .\nMarketing:{gap} Right .\nUser Interface:And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent ,\nMarketing:D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ?\nUser Interface:yeah ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:other entertainment devices .\nProject Manager:Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , {vocalsound} I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And limit the design {gap} . Do you think ?\nMarketing:Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . That's true . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:We'll have more money to go into the design side of it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Alright . Sounds great .\nMarketing:Mm , 'kay .\nProject Manager:Alright , well , um ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ?\nMarketing:Yes I am .\nProject Manager:Fabulous . Except you're not hooked up to the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Great .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay . Oh . I just lost my microphone .\nProject Manager:{gap} No problem ,\nMarketing:Just a moment .\nProject Manager:we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings . Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household .\nProject Manager:I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ?\nMarketing:Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:um , to influence our remote control . Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .\nProject Manager:I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ?\nMarketing:Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:They're you know thumb-masters . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting .\nProject Manager:Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {gap} the single function .\nProject Manager:And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's a good point .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's a huge amount . This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages .\nUser Interface:It's um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Is that {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's like the news . Or like information .\nUser Interface:It has {disfmarker} T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:The {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and what's on .\nMarketing:So like a running banner , underneath {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up .\nUser Interface:No , li Yeah .\nProject Manager:I haven't used it before\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:It's like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .\nIndustrial Designer:It's like very basic internet . Sort of ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Very basic internet , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But you have {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . Like tells you the weather , and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Like the internet you can send emails and {disfmarker} You've no interaction .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Alright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't {disfmarker} But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings .\nUser Interface:Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ?\nMarketing:P Sorry . Changing the channels ?\nUser Interface:Tuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels ,\nIndustrial Designer:To get the right reception and picture , I suppose .\nUser Interface:do you th do you think ?\nMarketing:Oh , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay . Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Repetitive strain injury .\nUser Interface:Repeti Uh .\nMarketing:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think .\nMarketing:Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ?\nProject Manager:That's rather sad . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um , maybe our\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . I'm not {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah . I think it is .\nMarketing:designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing:But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . It is .\nMarketing:Okay . Did you guys uh get that one down ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:Um {vocalsound} okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here . Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .\nProject Manager:I agree with um {disfmarker} if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned .\nMarketing:So that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um and depending on how many members you have in households .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .\nProject Manager:Yeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager:Wonder if it would have {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And if there was conversation in the room at the same time ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but {vocalsound} {gap} could be very difficult to get the specific uh design .\nProject Manager:{gap} Yeah . If we're looking for a simplistic design , if {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Mm .\nProject Manager:Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It looks like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .\nMarketing:It'd be like the ultimate remote . {gap} Um {vocalsound} okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with .\nProject Manager:Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is .\nMarketing:Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . S Or like um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mobile phone .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Or {disfmarker} Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock .\nIndustrial Designer:What , what would appear on the screen ?\nProject Manager:I have no idea still . {vocalsound} I'm sorry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh , on the remote . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Could it it {disfmarker} It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Like linked in with the teletext ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . That would be good , yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Might be quite expensive to do that though .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , Yeah . Could be . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and , yeah .\nMarketing:Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .\nUser Interface:Early twenties , that's the kind of age group .\nProject Manager:Yeah . And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control ,\nUser Interface:Twenties .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . That's it for the market research .\nProject Manager:Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on {gap} we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because {disfmarker} Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option .\nIndustrial Designer:Can I just interrupt ?\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Would you like to plug in your {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Maybe we can do the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Have you got a PowerPoint or not ?\nProject Manager:Yeah I do . I'm looking at {disfmarker} looking at it right now .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Thanks .\nMarketing:There you go .\nProject Manager:{gap} thank you .\nMarketing:Oh , come back screen .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?\nProject Manager:Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um {disfmarker} We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company\nIndustrial Designer:Just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but , another thing is that , um\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Work on that .\nMarketing:It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , I think .\nProject Manager:Real Reaction ? Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:It'll {disfmarker} It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Okay , so I {disfmarker} Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Is that how most people feel about that ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition .\nUser Interface:I think it would be annoying though if {disfmarker} I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous .\nUser Interface:You'd {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So is it just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Never heard of it .\nUser Interface:Okay . Alright .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Do you know if anywhere else has it ?\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know .\nUser Interface:I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:More research required , I think .\nUser Interface:I don't know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} But if {disfmarker} Was it a management decision that we're having {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It was a management decision ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay then .\nProject Manager:'Kay . So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple .\nMarketing:Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Minimal {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And the {disfmarker} What was the word they used ? F findability is important .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . The same signalling .\nProject Manager:the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's not that expensive to do .\nIndustrial Designer:Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . Like you just a , a buzz or something .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . Okay . I like that idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? {vocalsound} 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , so\nIndustrial Designer:If {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:you'd ha\nIndustrial Designer:Do you mean the the link between the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , with the button that you pressed .\nProject Manager:Yeah . The button {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , if the button was actually on {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Minor detail there .\nUser Interface:C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it would have t\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Obviously something small that's {disfmarker} Yeah , that's a good point .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use {disfmarker} It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Would it need a battery then ?\nProject Manager:Maybe , um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Pr probably .\nProject Manager:Probably , I mean .\nIndustrial Designer:Unless it could be {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's your department you'll have to sort that out .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , you'll have to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So , mm , more research into that one .\nProject Manager:Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:alright ? Great . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Y\nMarketing:On the buttons ?\nUser Interface:I I like the light up suggestion . I think that would be better .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} it doesn't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I would go for {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . And there's something on it . S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume .\nIndustrial Designer:Like a raised {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S\nUser Interface:Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised .\nMarketing:The numbers themselves .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Could be raised .\nMarketing:But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .\nUser Interface:Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:I just thought that {gap} it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's true .\nProject Manager:But I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , so like big b um buttons , {gap} for people you are visually impaired . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody .\nUser Interface:That , I think that's good , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Could we somehow {disfmarker} We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:No , it's not these days .\nUser Interface:No , I wouldn't say so .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I mean , it's quite easily accessible .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:That's good {disfmarker} Yeah that a good idea .\nMarketing:so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And you don't want to turn on the lights , {vocalsound} to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:It lights up for {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:That , yeah , that's a good idea .\nMarketing:On self timer .\nIndustrial Designer:So self-timed lighting .\nProject Manager:Alright we have five minutes left\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was {disfmarker} I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?\nMarketing:Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .\nProject Manager:Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow .\nIndustrial Designer:So , self-timed {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's probably feasible .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And I think that's un unique as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean , I haven't seen that . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah . And it could {gap} , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} durable .\nProject Manager:what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Oh right , the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah instead of like hard buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Repetitive strain injury .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?\nUser Interface:If {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .\nMarketing:I was gonna say , {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Exactly . It the {disfmarker} it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's kind of like Eighties neon-style .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and we could {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well ,\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:which could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right . Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things .\nUser Interface:I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or , or the , whate\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} Yeah .\nProject Manager:But with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well .\nMarketing:That's true .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Is {disfmarker} Are you okay with that ? Okay . Cool .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} Alright . So I think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions .\nIndustrial Designer:Is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And now it's up to designing . And um making sure that this can be feasible . And do you have anything {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you have anything to say ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh sorry . Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something .\nUser Interface:Oh yeah . Interchangeable thing ?\nMarketing:Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like an iPod or something ?\nUser Interface:That would be good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Exactly , like an iPod .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Or , or like mobile ph .\nProject Manager:Like a cellphone ? Yeah .\nMarketing:And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . Like a Bart Simpson faceplate .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Y Could buy extra {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Accessories .\nMarketing:Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .\nIndustrial Designer:Person {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Well , that's great .\nUser Interface:That's a good idea . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that .\nIndustrial Designer:Interchangeable .\nProject Manager:'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , als\nProject Manager:You'd just get one mould ,\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:throw some plastic in it , you know . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Interchan And also possible {disfmarker} I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues .\nUser Interface:Oh yeah .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . But if we , there is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:If w\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . We could {disfmarker} Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Um , does it need to be reached a de\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , I've {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Because we need to investigate the financial implications .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Is it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Let's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Does it need to be uh decided on now ? Or should we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then .\nProject Manager:Okay . Good . Alright then . Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:Alright , well . Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Thank you .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting mainly discussed the design of functions and the appearances. On function wise, the group had a little argument whether to make the product multi-functional or single functional. In the end they went with single-functional because it was more focused and affordable. They also removed some of the functions being discussed such as LCD screen, teletext and voice recognition, because they wanted to stick with a simplistic design. On design wise, the group finalized on the colour yellow as their product appearance and they chose illuminated buttons as one of their highlights. They also included some humanitarian factors into the design.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} Uh welcome back after lunch , I hope uh you had a good lunch together . For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . Okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker} the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed . And finally in this meeting we have to decide\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's uh little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up {vocalsound} so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm number two .\nProject Manager:You're number two . 'Kay\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Components design , there we go .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? Yeah .\nProject Manager:The next one .\nIndustrial Designer:Right here , is that little {disfmarker} that one , yes please .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll take the mouse . {vocalsound} So uh\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:we were looking he specifically at the components uh {disfmarker} the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:you have to have microphone {disfmarker} well no you don't actually I haven't {disfmarker} have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it has to it has to hear the speaker\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Um so the other w thing that we {disfmarker} So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um {disfmarker} we wanted to evaluate some new materials\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might {vocalsound} come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um {disfmarker} our research .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh {disfmarker} we can really seriously explore ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and th um there might be some {vocalsound} problems with the m uh how it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh goes with the board . {vocalsound} Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle {disfmarker} it gets brittle after a while ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how {vocalsound} Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} At least it's environmentally friendly . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So , {vocalsound} this is our finding .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're {disfmarker} we're {vocalsound} currently uh proposing ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which {vocalsound} I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , {vocalsound} and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:which w 'member the beam was {disfmarker} that was an important component of finding the right chip .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a {disfmarker} this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Can you go back uh one slide ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not sure , how do I {disfmarker} Oh , I know , let's see .\nUser Interface:Thank you . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Let's go back up here .\nProject Manager:Yes , uh {gap} question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um {vocalsound} and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting .\nProject Manager:Yeah , is it means it's on the {disfmarker} yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting .\nProject Manager:Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Sounds good .\nUser Interface:Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?\nIndustrial Designer:Because um it gets brittle , cracks {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um We want {disfmarker} we expect these um {vocalsound} uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . So . {vocalsound} Good ex {vocalsound} {gap} Good expression . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Whic\nMarketing:Wow ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Which {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} good expression . Well after us . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Although I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:uh it's {disfmarker} I'm not su {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So {gap} so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} you're what ?\nMarketing:Actually , I'm ready to sell it .\nUser Interface:I think {vocalsound} if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work ,\nMarketing:I'm ready to sell it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} You think ? {vocalsound} And you could {disfmarker} you could sell oils with it , to take care of it .\nUser Interface:but you can't just use {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No y {vocalsound} no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , exactly , yeah .\nMarketing:but there are some very pretty woods out there {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well I'm glad you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's actually very innovative idea .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay , good .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:The stain .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I mean it's {disfmarker} each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} In turns of wow . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Y yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Luckily Ed was not . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Wood ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think we can get the quality materials then {vocalsound} it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:One thing we'd have to check though is what the users {disfmarker} whether {disfmarker} how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} Yeah , for example . {vocalsound} So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it {vocalsound} {gap} for teething .\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah .\nMarketing:so {vocalsound} , and chew 'em up . And chew 'em up .\nProject Manager:Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes .\nUser Interface:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , I'm sorry .\nProject Manager:S you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You are in participant three .\nUser Interface:One point three , yeah\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh , yeah .\nProject Manager:This one ?\nUser Interface:I think so , yeah . Yeah , that's the one . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And also {vocalsound} um you had issues with the batteries running out ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is {disfmarker} starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . {vocalsound} And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip {vocalsound} thing and {disfmarker} Have I forgotten anything ? I don't think so . So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design ,\nMarketing:No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:A hinge . Be like a copper hinge or you know .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nUser Interface:But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , {vocalsound} you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:So , that's pretty much {vocalsound} all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . Um the centering of the key pad and {vocalsound} the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So what's your , uh , the comments or uh s\nMarketing:Simple design . It's what consumers want .\nProject Manager:Okay\nMarketing:It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Problem is obviously gonna be cost .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay , I also have a f {vocalsound} very simple presentation ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I also have uh copied a different type of remote . If you can find me , where I'm at . {vocalsound} There should only be one in here . {gap} trend watch .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sure .\nMarketing:It's being modified .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} They're stealing our product . {vocalsound} We've been giving simple {vocalsound} questionnaires in different areas because th {gap} obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . Uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh .\nIndustrial Designer:No ,\nUser Interface:No , no .\nIndustrial Designer:f go to findings .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No no , no no . {vocalsound} 'Cause I had another comment there . Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh {disfmarker} from the {vocalsound} questionnaires from the the {disfmarker} all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become {disfmarker} has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they {gap} look {disfmarker} it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . {vocalsound} The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:The first one , I see {vocalsound} that they put in a display . Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay Because I've seen {disfmarker} mostly the standard ones ,\nUser Interface:Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and\nMarketing:yeah . Now you have it {disfmarker} now you have one with the very simple also . The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , {vocalsound} uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um {vocalsound} a uh {vocalsound} uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball ,\nMarketing:, we might've {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} To t {vocalsound} an and then you would know like {vocalsound} um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:How hard they squeeze ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yes {vocalsound} you'd know what kind of wood to get .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Resistance resistance , right . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if {disfmarker} unless everyone has their own personal remote .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . Oh that {disfmarker} that actually would uh increase the um {disfmarker} the revenues we could expect , yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:The sales , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The {disfmarker} Yeah . I hope so .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No , but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and from {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Although , what it {disfmarker} was it uh {disfmarker} it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right , mm .\nUser Interface:And that took off , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:and then they sold millions , millions . So . So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market .\nIndustrial Designer:We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um {vocalsound} labour laws .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh {vocalsound} , countries like , uh , India\nIndustrial Designer:Cost of living is low .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Good , well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more\nProject Manager:Yeah , {vocalsound} yeah , so Yes .\nUser Interface:Mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and to where {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} Yeah , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nMarketing:We're here to design , come up with a nice product . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes uh , but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get {disfmarker} to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . And your design {vocalsound} whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display {vocalsound} right in front of you .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:very specifically what it would be used for ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but that's just sort of speculation , I mean .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} What do you think Ed ? Do you {disfmarker} he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No . No\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ?\nMarketing:{gap} no p spec {vocalsound} It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound} Sorry about that .\nMarketing:Um , no that's no problem . I'm here for the {vocalsound} pushing it after it's made . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:I will market it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Once we get a price on it then we can market it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the {vocalsound} the advanced chip on print is what um what we've {vocalsound} we've deci we've determined\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:A customisable and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What about the buttons , would {disfmarker} Would the buttons be wood too , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh I don't think so , no ,\nProject Manager:I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer:I think they could be rubber like they are now ,\nProject Manager:Yes . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:so you have that tactile experience of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Don't looks nice uh . Yeah , so uh what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . Okay . So\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay ?\nUser Interface:Sure .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So um are we done with this meeting ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , I hope , if {disfmarker} is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can uh submit to the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I will submit to the management . Okay ? Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And a marketing strategy .\nMarketing:And marketing strategy , thank you .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . How much you can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Fired . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:how mu how much how much you can sell extra .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Of course you'll make money too ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , so , any questions ?\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's okay ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then . Okay ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Thank you .\n",
        "summary": "This meeting focused on the conception of the functional design of the new remote control. Industrial Designer evaluated several components in the technical design of the product and gave his personal preferences, especially on the chip and the material to use in the construction. Then User Interface presented a general layout of the functionality, the design of which should follow two principles: simpleness and customizability. Marketing, in his turn, explained the current market trend based on the results of his questionnaires on user requirements. The group also discussed where the remote control would be manufactured by taking into account the price of the local labour force.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So we are here for the concept design meeting . So , we will first start by summarizing the mm {vocalsound} the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest {disfmarker} next task , to have {disfmarker} to be done before the next meeting . So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . We also decided to have a wheel to change channel {disfmarker} previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by {disfmarker} or U_I_ {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Abdul al-Hasred is my name .\nProject Manager:okay . {vocalsound} And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . So this is the presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , I_D_ you want ?\nProject Manager:Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I only v have three slides , so . I just look at the mm {disfmarker} um just this . On some web pages to find some documentation\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . And um {vocalsound} yeah we can change directly .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not {disfmarker} if if we could combine something with the push button .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah\nProject Manager:So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?\nIndustrial Designer:I I th {vocalsound} But I don't think that uh we should {disfmarker} We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay\nUser Interface:Also have to say {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um that's all {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No ?\nProject Manager:You received something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . I haven't chec\nUser Interface:Yeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Says {disfmarker} Yeah . It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . But I guess it could be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And could it be adapted ?\nUser Interface:I guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .\nProject Manager:Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?\nUser Interface:Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah .\nUser Interface:then we we could use it .\nProject Manager:Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on {disfmarker} according to those news .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but I think it's yeah {disfmarker} Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . Um {vocalsound} the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and if we could reduce that . We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . I have a question about that actually {vocalsound} . Um , what is the purpose of the light ?\nIndustrial Designer:Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker} But in th in the dark uh {disfmarker} Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?\nProject Manager:It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ?\nUser Interface:But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:You can see the buttons better , of course .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . True .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Actually .\nUser Interface:But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to {disfmarker} when you move it to detect your movement .\nIndustrial Designer:As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Again .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound} no it's too expensive . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . Mm . Extra . Yeah , okay . Mm . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , a little bit . A little bit .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Well we will discuss that after maybe\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay\nProject Manager:the other presentations .\nUser Interface:. So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So . It was last time I saw it .\nProject Manager:And it is .\nUser Interface:Okay . So ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} just move to the next slide . {vocalsound} So basically {vocalsound} want very simple , right ? That's the major idea , as simple as possible .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um . {vocalsound} So .\nProject Manager:And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .\nProject Manager:Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:These are the basic thing .\nProject Manager:So it's only the central part .\nUser Interface:So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .\nProject Manager:Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .\nUser Interface:Yeah , if you have , for example {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It could be on the right side , for example .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things .\nProject Manager:Okay . S\nUser Interface:Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .\nProject Manager:Okay . Will be down or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So that they're separate a bit ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:yeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other {disfmarker} the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Alright , you won't {disfmarker} yeah . Usually what {disfmarker} I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . That you want to protect a bit . And I think it's uh it's reasonable .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So , I don't think {disfmarker} Yeah , this is just the the wheel .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:We could use the {disfmarker} some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Maybe the wheel will be a {vocalsound} good advantage over our competitors .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect .\nIndustrial Designer:To s Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that .\nProject Manager:Okay . So we can move to the {disfmarker} Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? {vocalsound} or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , I can go ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Can I ? {vocalsound} So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And the third most important aspect is to to {disfmarker} is that the co remote control should be easy to use . So , are things we are we have uh speak about before .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . And um {disfmarker} so you you can go {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:after . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . {vocalsound} So , maybe if our {vocalsound} remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:something like that , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I support an apple .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And the mm the material is expected to be spongy .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh I don't know which material {vocalsound} can be spongy ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and if you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:This is good also for {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:it it would work , right ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah .\nUser Interface:You can throw it to the television .\nProject Manager:Yeah , because it's robust .\nMarketing:Okay {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Me too .\nMarketing:It's robust , yeah .\nUser Interface:Hey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:When it d uh takes a shock .\nProject Manager:Yeah\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Not good .\nProject Manager:uh sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:Ah it's okay . I know that they do that for alarm clock also .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . You ca uh you can go uh before\nProject Manager:No . Yeah . Before ?\nMarketing:, before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah that's why {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Has it ?\nMarketing:Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think it's {disfmarker} it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Innovative . Mm .\nProject Manager:So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept .\nUser Interface:How do we make it look cool is the question .\nProject Manager:Cool , fancy ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe uh um {vocalsound} a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .\nIndustrial Designer:What about um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm . Oh , colour , yeah .\nUser Interface:Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .\nMarketing:Oh {disfmarker} i i {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Maybe yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I thought about a a pear , for example . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand\nProject Manager:Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well .\nMarketing:and uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:A pear .\nUser Interface:The banana is also ergonomic .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .\nMarketing:Or a fruit like that . I dunno .\nProject Manager:Yeah . We can discuss that uh . D D Is is there anything you want to add ?\nUser Interface:Is there any fruit that is spongy ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ?\nProject Manager:But that's not in the trend . {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:You can make it um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's not hard , the metal .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Plastic . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Odi\nIndustrial Designer:Banana I think , it's a nice idea .\nProject Manager:Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .\nIndustrial Designer:Because {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that ,\nUser Interface:Two of the button , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and here you have a a push button to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But you don't have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think it's a good idea , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:no ?\nProject Manager:I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find .\nIndustrial Designer:And everybody knows what is a banana .\nUser Interface:You can put also vibrator inside .\nIndustrial Designer:Basically .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha\nUser Interface:Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , yeah {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah it's really uh really a good point .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I hope the students of management die ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but anyway . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Now who are recording this meeting ?\nProject Manager:I think it {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} One second . So we have to take some decision on this aspect . So , uh so for {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:sorry , for uh component , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:we have to think about those aspects , sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:So we will just use a a standard battery ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh the chip we {disfmarker} chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ?\nProject Manager:I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .\nUser Interface:The only th Yeah . Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Spongy also .\nUser Interface:I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to {disfmarker} I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh no I think it's possible .\nUser Interface:So if we try to push the buttons , it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No the button would be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You think it's possible ?\nProject Manager:In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:. This is uh like the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay odd shape with spongy {disfmarker} cover . And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . So we agree to put the wheel {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Wheel on the top . Button , where do we want some buttons ?\nUser Interface:Well , usually hold {disfmarker} {vocalsound} 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So it have to {disfmarker} it has to be symmetrical .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o {vocalsound} It has to be {disfmarker} basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Basically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .\nProject Manager:Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable .\nUser Interface:This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ?\nProject Manager:Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm .\nUser Interface:Should have the two sides .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So if {gap} the left , we have {disfmarker} the op\nProject Manager:I think you can turn it this way also . You can do both with both hands .\nUser Interface:Wheel {disfmarker} Wheel buttons .\nProject Manager:I think it's okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . So you cannot see them .\nProject Manager:Well , you you will get used to it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons .\nUser Interface:So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be {disfmarker} Y Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .\nProject Manager:Yeah . No you you {disfmarker} I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well . I think this doesn't change that much .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Okay . Maybe . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . And {disfmarker} and uh a wheel on the top .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So the colour is yellow . I think it's uh {disfmarker} we defined everything according to what we should {disfmarker} what the decision we should take , yeah . So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc {disfmarker} the product . That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . That would uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:be better , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And uh {disfmarker} And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes master .\nProject Manager:do you need to add anything ?\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You feel okay ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You don't feel free to answer this ?\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Maybe you can make {gap} uh {vocalsound} uh mm\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:See you .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting focused on the cost and design implication of including the wheel, the best way to include the light, ensuring that buttons are well-placed, and choosing a fashionable fruit as the remote's design. Project Manager reiterated that several decisions, like not having an LCD, having a wheel, and including a lighting feature, have been made in the previous meeting. Then, Industrial Designer highlighted that the wheel was expensive, though, likely still within the budget. User Interface led some discussion about placing the buttons in a way that minimizes strain for the user. Finally, Marketing informed the group that fruits and vegetables were the upcoming fashion trend. The group decided that a banana would be a good option for the design and discussed how existing priorities could be adapted to a curved design.",

I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view .\nProject Manager:Excellent . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is uh the apparatus made of ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and the third is what should it look like .\nProject Manager:What should it look like ? Okay .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Oh , let's kick it off . Oh , there we go . So , our new project is about {disfmarker} we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . {disfmarker} I think well it sums up what we need to do . It's We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need to {vocalsound} um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about {disfmarker} So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this . Uh . Okay . Every meeting we {disfmarker} everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have {disfmarker} we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's {disfmarker} actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . Like you see here , I'll just take the {disfmarker} take {gap} here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want . It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just {vocalsound} either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . So it should be really easy .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:This is to take the {disfmarker} just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be {disfmarker} it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out . {vocalsound} Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . So next , been here . {vocalsound} Well , {gap} gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . I think the creative genius should go first . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The creative genius ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Thank you very much .\nProject Manager:So , draw us your favourite animal .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so I'm not really good at drawing animals ,\nProject Manager:Draw us a technical animal .\nUser Interface:but uh the animal which I {gap} {disfmarker} Oh .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's still erasing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Pen .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh format . Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like {vocalsound} a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see . A head . {gap} actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very {disfmarker} Uh high-tech .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Bit low-responsive though .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So that's what we don't want .\nUser Interface:Prefer pen and paper .\nProject Manager:We want a high-responsive product . So {disfmarker} It looks more like nuclear bomb .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Very nice dolphin .\nUser Interface:It {vocalsound} {vocalsound} doesn't look like a nuclear bomb .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:This thing isn't doing what I'm {disfmarker} What I want .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Let's go easy on it .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So it doesn't really look like a dolphin ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Anyway ,\nUser Interface:but then again , this is all new for me .\nProject Manager:it should {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it {disfmarker} that it represents .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:Like the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What do you like ? Okay . Well ,\nUser Interface:Now we can forget this ever happened .\nProject Manager:our Marketing Expert . Show us an animal .\nMarketing:Um an animal .\nProject Manager:{gap} Pick a {disfmarker} pick a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I like the elephant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:pick a clean sheet . Oh .

Yeah , it's up there .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:That's it .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You picked a hard one , didn't you ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:My drawing skills are really bad , so .\nMarketing:Experience with the tiger .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What ? They are {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:They are really bad , my drawing skills .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay uh-huh .\nProject Manager:Sure looks smooth .\nMarketing:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not sure how the legs should go , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh these are stripes .\nUser Interface:Got it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources .\nProject Manager:What does it want ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use .\nProject Manager:I agree .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:, I'm supposed to draw the animal next . Yay I introduce to the world the amazing ant .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh hard worker .\nProject Manager:Great team-workers .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . So I'm gonna give it a smiley face .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Not sure where the p {gap} . Just put 'em here . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Think it need shoes . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's the coolest ant ever .\nUser Interface:You've done this before , haven't you ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I love to draw ants . It's my hobby .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Anyway {disfmarker} Nah . {vocalsound} Just {disfmarker} I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take {disfmarker} just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Just {disfmarker} Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway . {gap} another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now . Uh put this down . Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but {disfmarker} Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . So what do you guys think about {disfmarker} The first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? What {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , I basically had a question . Do {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in\nProject Manager:The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control .\nMarketing:Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Just for T_V_ remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I guess so .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it {disfmarker} revolutionary changes ,\nProject Manager:Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess .\nUser Interface:yes . {vocalsound} Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add ,\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , we want {disfmarker} I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} I mean , really disabled people , yeah , {vocalsound} might be a problem , but I think it's a little {gap} take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ?\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's {disfmarker} it speaks for itself ,\nProject Manager:It should be light , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but some uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , let's see ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:where did I {disfmarker} Let's skip that . Oh , this is it . Sorry , I skipped this sheet .\nMarketing:Selling price .\nProject Manager:What do we {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} Quick {gap} {disfmarker} What we're going to {disfmarker} Selling price , twenty five Euros . That's for you . The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Just go go for that . We'll reach the uh reach that profit .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay , well that's not that much to work with . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} international .\nProject Manager:No , it's not much to work on . I'm sorry , I skipped it . {vocalsound} Anyways , that's {disfmarker} Yeah , this is it . Do you have anything you you came up with yet ? About uh marketing transfer , whatever ?\nMarketing:Um about what ? Marketing ?\nProject Manager:Marketing {gap} I'm not sure what you what you came up with yet . You have anything to share ?

My family's beagle .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Lovely . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , {vocalsound} I'm gonna be up there with them .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:There's too much gear . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ok oh we do we do\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles .\nProject Manager:Ach {gap} why not {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Boy , let me tell you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We might have to get you up again then .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't know what mine is .

Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . Allergic to animal fur ,\nProject Manager:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:so um fish was a natural choice . Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . They come in and go {vocalsound} eat everything in sight . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Alright . Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay . God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . Um .\nMarketing:Superb sketch , by the way .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Tail's a bit big , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I was gonna choose a dog as well .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But I'll just draw a different kind of dog .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} That doesn't really look like him , actually . He looks more like a pig , actually . Ah well .\nMarketing:I see a dog in there .\nProject Manager:Do you ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh that's very good of you .\nMarketing:Yep . {vocalsound} Now I see a rooster .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh .\nMarketing:What kind is it ?\nProject Manager:Um he's a mixture of uh various things . Um and what do I like about him , um {disfmarker} That's just to suggest that his tail wags .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um {vocalsound} uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can {disfmarker} doesn't take up too much space .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um and uh {disfmarker} And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:which is quite amusing , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?\nProject Manager:It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's an after dinner dog then .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .\nProject Manager:Yeah , maybe . Maybe . {vocalsound} Right , um where did you find this ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Just down here ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .\nMarketing:'Kay . Um , can we just go over that again ?\nProject Manager:Sure .\nMarketing:Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . Okay . So cost {disfmarker} like production cost is twelve fifty ,\nProject Manager:All together .\nMarketing:but selling price is {disfmarker} is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf .\nProject Manager:Um I dunno . I imagine {disfmarker} That's a good question .\nMarketing:Our sale our sale anyway .\nProject Manager:I imagine it probably is our sale actually\nMarketing:Yeah , okay okay .\nProject Manager:because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .\nMarketing:Okay . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:But I {disfmarker} I don't know ,\nMarketing:Alright .\nProject Manager:I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?\nMarketing:Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Think it will ? Um .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Hmm .\nMarketing:Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah .\nMarketing:Um f frequencies or something\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um .\nProject Manager:I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .\nMarketing:I don't know . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So , possibly .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?\nMarketing:Just a chara just a characteristic of the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like how much money people have to spend on things like ?\nMarketing:Just {disfmarker} Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows ,\nProject Manager:Aye , I see what you mean , yeah .\nMarketing:something like that , yeah .\nProject Manager:Marketing . Good marketing thoughts .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yep .\nProject Manager:Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um .\nMarketing:Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:something other than just standard . Um so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the {disfmarker} thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .\nMarketing:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Or no , is it as much as that ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .\nMarketing:Yep . Yeah , I'd say so , yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .\nMarketing:No . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um right , okay . Let me just scoot on ahead here . Okay . Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? Thin\nMarketing:Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other\nProject Manager:No , actually . That would be useful , though ,\nMarketing:other {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something .\nProject Manager:Oh . Five minutes to end of meeting .\nMarketing:It just comes along .\nProject Manager:Oh , okay . We're a bit behind .\nMarketing:Do you know what I mean ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .\nUser Interface:I know um {disfmarker} My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} Right . Right .\nUser Interface:So um for them it was just how many devices control .\nMarketing:Okay so {disfmarker} Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,\nMarketing:I think so .\nProject Manager:do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:everything , agenda . So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:such as the lighting in your house , or um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh that's a good idea . So extra functionalities .\nMarketing:An Yeah . Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know , the sound and everything it's just one system .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:But each one's got its own little part .\nProject Manager:Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . Um I'll just check we've nothing else . Okay . Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?\nIndustrial Designer:And you keep losing them .\nProject Manager:You keep losing them .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Finding them is really a pain , you know .\nMarketing:Mm . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:or it's kicked under the table .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You know .\nMarketing:That's just really good id Yep .\nProject Manager:There {disfmarker} I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?\nMarketing:Uh , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Dunno .\nMarketing:sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay maybe . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something .\nProject Manager:My goodness .\nMarketing:And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table .\nProject Manager:Still feels quite primitive .\nMarketing:Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S\nProject Manager:Maybe like a touch screen or something ?\nMarketing:Something like that , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Or whatever would be technologically reasonable .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh , okay . Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer .\nMarketing:'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It looks better .\nMarketing:You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , nicer materials\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:and might be\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:be worth exploring anyway .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:Right , well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually {disfmarker} what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . {vocalsound} And uh and that's the end of the meeting . So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:um , do we {disfmarker} We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something ,\nProject Manager:Uh-huh , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:right ? Well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?\nProject Manager:Th Okay , well just very quickly\nMarketing:I I don't know .\nProject Manager:'cause this {disfmarker} we're supposed to finish now . Um I guess that's up to us ,\nMarketing:Yep . Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I think one factor would be production cost .\nMarketing:Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Because there's a cap there ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I think that that's the main factor .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um\nMarketing:Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , uh\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:thank you all for coming . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Cool .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\n",

It really looks like a banana .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It is a banana .\nProject Manager:It is a banana . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It is the essence of bananas . I would be confused with this thing .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:S\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:How is everyone ?\nProject Manager:Hi .\nIndustrial Designer:Hi .\nProject Manager:So we are here for the detailed design meeting .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:we will uh {disfmarker} I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . Then uh I've {disfmarker} I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . Then we will uh evaluate the product . And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with {disfmarker} it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . So\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , {vocalsound} to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:to be uh to feel spongy ,\nUser Interface:Like a banana .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh {disfmarker} we can continue with this product uh as if ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . So uh you can have my project in {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . You have a presentation ?\nMarketing:Uh yeah just a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Participant four , yes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Four . Evaluation .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . So you can go . We can go through .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to {vocalsound} the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:okay so uh we have uh six points . We we talked about before .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , {vocalsound} easy to find in a room , and robust ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ?\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:The {disfmarker} okay ? {vocalsound} Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ?\nProject Manager:Okay . Maybe you can presen {vocalsound}\nMarketing:F between o one and seven .\nProject Manager:okay . Maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound} hold it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So I think it's uh very uh very nice . What do you think ?\nUser Interface:I give it a {disfmarker} I give it a five .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So it's between one and seven ? Seven is the highest uh ?\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} Seven is the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I will give a six .\nIndustrial Designer:I will give a a five .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And you ?\nMarketing:{gap} sorry .\nUser Interface:Do you vote uh Christine ?\nMarketing:{gap} eh ?\nUser Interface:Do you also vote ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No , I just want to see something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Maybe we all have to agree on a common {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , we can {gap} very easily {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh I think uh {gap} {vocalsound} and need to {gap} as well {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:No problem . So\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Need to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:this is your {disfmarker}\nMarketing:uh I don't know if you {disfmarker} we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:One is most {gap} .\nUser Interface:I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh-uh .\nProject Manager:Well , we can choose what we want .\nMarketing:Um . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , let's say that seven is the best .\nMarketing:Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Okay . So so do note the grade we have five , six for me ,\nIndustrial Designer:Five .\nProject Manager:five . And what what's your choice ?\nMarketing:Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?\nMarketing:Six {disfmarker} Uh s you can {disfmarker} how much what ?\nProject Manager:How much would you {disfmarker} you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ?\nMarketing:Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So it will have five point five average .\nProject Manager:Five point five average .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Wa can {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Well , does it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I sorry .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . So after , the technological aspect ?\nProject Manager:Okay , techne technological aspect .\nMarketing:So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel .\nProject Manager:Yeah , we have the wheel . We also have the rubber material ,\nMarketing:Uh .\nProject Manager:which make it uh like new also . I think I would give a five .\nUser Interface:It's {gap} four .\nProject Manager:Four ?\nIndustrial Designer:A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:The rubber is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh a four . I I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:D are we including the voice {disfmarker} are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ?\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:No . Okay .\nProject Manager:So\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:what's your uh grade ?\nMarketing:Four .\nProject Manager:Four ? So we have four , four f and five ?\nMarketing:We can put four ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four .\nUser Interface:For twenty five .\nMarketing:Everyone is okay or {disfmarker} four poin Four .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Doesn't it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think so . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I give a seven , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Six .\nProject Manager:I would give a {disfmarker} I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer:Six .\nMarketing:Mm , six for me also .\nProject Manager:So\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nMarketing:Six point five . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:six point five .\nIndustrial Designer:Six six six point five .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} Is it fashion ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh yeah ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:its its f its fruit fruit shape .\nMarketing:Seven ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I would say seven . And is very very nice design .\nMarketing:Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , we can we can put a seven here .\nMarketing:and we say that the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , seven .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah , seven .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Seven , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well , we hope .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Easy to find .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh easy to find in a room ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I lost my banana . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think you can't miss it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here .\nMarketing:We have the lightning , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , we have {vocalsound} the {vocalsound}\nMarketing:The lighting .\nProject Manager:we don't sesh especially have the lightning\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So you'll make the material transparent\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so that it uh lights up completely , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So it's yellow . It's okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . {gap}\nProject Manager:I think it's very easy to {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Seven ?\nProject Manager:I would say seven . It's hard to miss it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Six . Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Is it {disfmarker} is it robust ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber .\nProject Manager:I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah the only problem there might be {disfmarker} which {gap} know , i if it's very sensitive ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:they will ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I don't know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But it is uh {disfmarker} it is surrounded by rubber material .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:So maybe we can put a six .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Everybody is okay , six .\nIndustrial Designer:Six or five . Five {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Six is okay ?\nUser Interface:Six , yeah , for me .\nIndustrial Designer:Six .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:S now {vocalsound} um so .\nProject Manager:Tadada . We have to sum up everything .\nUser Interface:Twenty .\nMarketing:Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six {gap} .\nUser Interface:Thirty . Thir\nMarketing:That's that's okay ? Six .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Six is a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , the be .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah , the top {disfmarker}\nMarketing:and when uh s six sit six are good {disfmarker} it's a good uh p product , I think .\nProject Manager:Okay , so six is a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . So will become eight soon ?\nProject Manager:So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising .\nUser Interface:Yeah , well it's a bit biased . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Huh .\nMarketing:We have a good price and uh {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So this prototype is quite nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Good .\nUser Interface:Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface:uh quite big also ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and they were selling {gap} something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Just a {vocalsound} just a phone , wireless .\nProject Manager:So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not {disfmarker} cannot compare .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:it's much more complex , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Start to eat banana . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay so congratulation . {vocalsound} Nice product .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Congratulations to the team . Uh very well , we worked together fantastically .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think it was a good collaboration uh . Aspect .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So what does the management say ?\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nUser Interface:What does the management say ?\nProject Manager:I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well .\nUser Interface:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:All it depends on who watch this meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , so\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:good guys {vocalsound} ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so see you for next uh successful project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Yeah . Fruits .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\n",
        "summary": "In the development of the project, this meeting was at the basis where a prototype of the product had been designed and it mainly focused on discussion about the cost and pricing of the product based on the material it used and the profit they wanted to obtain through this product. It turned out that the cost was very reasonable and the price was also very attractive. Then, the team evaluated the product by scoring according to criteria based on the user's requirements and marketing trends. The meeting went very well and every team member agreed with each other on the evaluation results, which was promising to lead a success in this project.",

        "conversations": "Marketing:Just put it on the deskt {gap} desktop .\nProject Manager:No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link . A well actually just there .\nMarketing:Project documents ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's it .\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:If you dump it in there .\nMarketing:What's your username ?\nProject Manager:Your username .\nMarketing:What's your username and password ? Mm-hmm . Sorry .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . There we go .\nProject Manager:Excellent . Right . Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . So . Functional design meeting . We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . Not a lot thankfully to say . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Um . Now . Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want .\nMarketing:Sure . Um , sh would you like to {vocalsound} I'll just do it from here .\nProject Manager:Yep . Sorry . Uh . Is yours the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um , try second one maybe . Try it , yeah maybe .\nProject Manager:Oh sorry . Okay , right .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay . Oh , I thought I put in my last name , I guess not , but {gap} .\nProject Manager:Uh if you {disfmarker} that's all right . If you {disfmarker} do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ?\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah , that'd be fine , that'd be great .\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nMarketing:Okay . Functional requirement by me Ebenezer . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . We asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people {vocalsound} fifteen people in each group .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} So we got {disfmarker} some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . {vocalsound} Most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . And if they do , not very often . Takes too long to master the remote control . I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . Some of the good stuff we got . Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . Now don't get excited yet , I've got more to say on that . Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Finally , my opinion .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:The voice recognition thing is cool . And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you can't have that many words . For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . I'm pretty sure people would buy it . But after a while people may wanna return it , because {vocalsound} if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . {vocalsound} However , {vocalsound} oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . See , you could {disfmarker} there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine .\nProject Manager:Okay , yep .\nMarketing:So we have the three birds , we have the design , that {vocalsound} we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition's fancy , it's cool , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit I don't remember {vocalsound} so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . Um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . {vocalsound} And uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . Uh , will people return the remote control , {vocalsound} I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . If you could uh\nMarketing:do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . So . These are things I think we should consider .\nProject Manager:sor\nMarketing:I think it's cool ,\nProject Manager:if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah .\nMarketing:I'm sorry ? Sure .\nProject Manager:Sorry .\nMarketing:I'm about to end , yeah .\nProject Manager:Cool .\nMarketing:I think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations .\nProject Manager:Okay . Excellent .\nMarketing:So , yeah .\nProject Manager:Right . Um . Hear from the {vocalsound} User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um , you've got your presentation now ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} How did {disfmarker} where did {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's in the it's in the folder\nProject Manager:is it on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:where did you get all your in information {gap} ?\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:is it ? Okay .\nMarketing:There was uh a website , uh ,\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Technical functions ?\nMarketing:right here .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah , okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:No . Yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay , this is a {vocalsound} brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I {vocalsound} had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance , so\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:press on . I've looked at {vocalsound} looked at a num {vocalsound} uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on . {vocalsound} Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . Um to save you getting off your backside . Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . On the one hand {disfmarker} and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what {vocalsound} what is most likely to get used . Um {vocalsound} With uh {disfmarker} a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . Um and if you {vocalsound} if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ {vocalsound} D_V_D_ or uh {vocalsound} V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . Um . My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . Um but uh the pro {vocalsound} I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from {vocalsound} want it to do most . So , something that's uh {vocalsound} something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . Um so that those are then immediately {vocalsound} accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp {vocalsound} you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's {vocalsound} going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . Um , this is actually {gap} a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the {vocalsound} and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . And so it's taking taking the lead from that . Um .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's it .\nProject Manager:Right . Um , if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh , I was still working on stuff , I hadn't got it finished . Um , {vocalsound} alright . Click to save in {disfmarker} where do I have to save it ?\nProject Manager:If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . If you save it in there we can open it up from here .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um , what I've done with it , I'm sorry . Shit . Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Are you finding it okay or ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'm just {gap} closing it now . {gap} where I've saved it .\nMarketing:Well like if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} that's it there ,\nMarketing:yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:and you just click file save as .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , right I'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen . Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . So uh uh , if you go to next slide , you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . Do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . Um , {vocalsound} , or would that take too much power , would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? Um , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {vocalsound} , so uh we need to {disfmarker} I dunno exactly what {disfmarker} That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design , um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So , that'll be decided , I guess . {vocalsound} Uh , and the next slide . Oh , yeah {disfmarker} Um , if you go to the next slide then .\nProject Manager:Oh . Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I just used the {vocalsound} it was a mess , uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ah , don't worry about it at all mate . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything . You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . Uh , so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? Um , I dunno what we should decide on that .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well . Oh sorry , I'm I'm interrupting you . Are you {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No , it's finished , yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah ? Okay . Right . Um , {vocalsound} right we can probably skip that for now . So , we've had some stuff put forward , um along with the new user requirements , um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about {vocalsound} um voice activated control . However I've got a couple of worries about that . {vocalsound} The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues .\nIndustrial Designer:Cost . Mm .\nProject Manager:Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Um that's just my view right now ,\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , but it might be quite low ?\nMarketing:Mm . I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or {vocalsound} uh , interactive L_C_D_ or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a {vocalsound} a mobile phone ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That could be one possibility . Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . {gap} I I was thinking that the remote {vocalsound} the um {vocalsound} sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels .\nProject Manager:We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ?\nUser Interface:Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing , um . And I think {vocalsound} and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I would agree with you .\nUser Interface:Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It does nothing extra .\nProject Manager:That would be my feeling as well , I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . Um now I mean I don't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or {disfmarker} and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one ,\nProject Manager:sorry , go for it .\nMarketing:but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are {disfmarker} niche are we trying to market and corner . You know , you know what I'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ? Everybody ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people .\nMarketing:Most people , yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . But that does cover a very large section of the people out there .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Sure . I think that's fair {vocalsound} yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um , I mean I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and who would normally use the unit .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick\nProject Manager:I dunno .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put um I mean there are {disfmarker} like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . Um .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:But uh but the {vocalsound} but then o uh obviously if uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i {vocalsound} you you then get to sort of menu navigation . I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and {vocalsound} fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra {gap}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling . Um {gap} concern about our market . Um , if we are I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of {gap} remote control rationalisation . Um , you've got twenty different devices in your living room ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:you want one wo {vocalsound} y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . Um , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I just think that uh possibly {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid ,\nUser Interface:mm .\nProject Manager:this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:So um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:So I can understand your point , and I would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . 'Fraid to say . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Does that um would that include um access to say {vocalsound} interactive functions on digital or cable ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . Um I think that it {disfmarker} I would say that the design spec we've been {gap} with is for the television only for now .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that .\nMarketing:Hmm . Okay , specifically television .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So the joystick is just for differentness .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Just a thought . {vocalsound} Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers , rather than the public . Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:There is that possibility , yes . B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert ,\nMarketing:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that might be sales , who are not in this meeting .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:We just {disfmarker} Is this gonna be enough to to sell ?\nProject Manager:Well , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , in fact we've probably all done .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you {disfmarker} tell you where it is .\nUser Interface:Mm , yeah , I've seen them .\nMarketing:I had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up\nProject Manager:Um . Well\nMarketing:because it it went off all the time accidentally .\nProject Manager:the other option of course is that um the\nMarketing:The clapping one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:well {disfmarker} I was going to say clapping , um {disfmarker} Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has {disfmarker} of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:To a television . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think that's a good idea .\nProject Manager:And that could be something could um separate us a bit .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's a good idea .\nProject Manager:And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't {disfmarker} power {gap} that might be something that we could look into .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yep . Yeah , it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think so , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So . To go on from here . Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going {disfmarker} this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:Mm yeah . Yeah , I think that's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We're just saying volume . Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume ,\nUser Interface:For volume .\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Um , power is used like once per hour ,\nIndustrial Designer:I\nMarketing:channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen ,\nProject Manager:Vol Volume selection okay , yep ,\nMarketing:and volume selection .\nProject Manager:the teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No , yeah , okay okay . Yeah , um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So we {disfmarker} well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? So we're having very very few buttons involved ,\nUser Interface:Actually how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but navigation around a menu for most things .\nUser Interface:Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the {disfmarker} y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Or vice versa .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:And that's really irritating .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb .\nProject Manager:Okay . So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , think so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Do you mind looking {gap} ?\nMarketing:Um , I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The ability to locate it again .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and {vocalsound} what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base .\nIndustrial Designer:Light bulb as well ,\nUser Interface:Oh . So {vocalsound} so\nIndustrial Designer:no ?\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nUser Interface:a small speaker you mean .\nProject Manager:Some speaker ,\nMarketing:Speaker {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:sorry , yeah .\nMarketing:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And a light bulb ? No . To flash . No .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} E us we might be better with the sound possibly {disfmarker} we could maybe incorporate\nMarketing:W those little key-rings have both ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway .\nMarketing:so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Blue ones particularly .\nProject Manager:Um . {vocalsound} So\nUser Interface:Plus that's a nice wee design touch .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such . Ebenezer , um , Marketing Expert {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right .\nProject Manager:If ,\nMarketing:You want the stuff {gap} .\nProject Manager:yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:but could be something we could maybe look into .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Sure . Sure .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? Anything that they think has been missed out . Bit of a wide open question there of course .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible .\nMarketing:Sure . 'Kay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:So I should just look at um the speaker , {gap} the speaker and an L_E_D_ .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , um ,\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Transmitter {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and a transmitter .\nProject Manager:transmitter {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Actually one one wee thought about that . Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .\nProject Manager:{gap} getting the external power source , yep , that's quite true . Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so that's good .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} You know I think\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . Quite quickly .\nIndustrial Designer:P\nProject Manager:Oh , one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , my apologies for that , um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , um it's ,\nIndustrial Designer:Fashion .\nProject Manager:I'm pointing at my laptop , what in God {disfmarker} Real reaction , and such . So um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:The slogan is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh , sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , isn't it ?\nProject Manager:My apologies . No it could well be , I've probably missed that . Um , I think that's l almost the last minute thing\nIndustrial Designer:'S also look cool .\nProject Manager:we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:In fact we might like to put a slogan on , and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company . Rather than real reaction .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button .\nProject Manager:Sounds good .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:And I'd say that that's us for now . Okay .\n",
        "summary": "After Project Manager's brief review of the last meeting, Marketing began a presentation of the user requirements. It frustrated users most when they failed to find the lost remote control. The market research also revealed a necessity to simplify the remote control interface, for most buttons were not used. User Interface and Industrial Designer agreed on the intuitive interface design with menu navigation on an LCD screen and very few buttons involved. The new remote control would only be for basic functions such as volume adjusting and channel flipping. A separate joystick would be for additional functionality. The new remote control would be the integration of original remote controls for different devices. Voice recognition would not be feasible due to the budget limit. A speaker and a transmitter were desirable, however, for the location function.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already .\nMarketing:Good afternoon .\nProject Manager:I hope you enjoyed your lunch . {vocalsound} I did anyway . {vocalsound} Um let's see . Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes . Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? No ?\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:Everything fine ?\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:That's nice . Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials . Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out . And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?\nMarketing:Sure .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:I'll start off then .\nProject Manager:Good luck . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Doh . 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and {disfmarker} Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the {disfmarker} These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we {vocalsound} at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really {disfmarker} This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . That would be all .\nProject Manager:Okay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ?\nMarketing:Any questions ?\nProject Manager:Mayb\nUser Interface:Mm no .\nProject Manager:No ? Okay , we go on to the next one .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} 'kay um yeah . {gap} uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh {disfmarker} I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um {disfmarker} Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and {disfmarker} Uh {gap} we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um {disfmarker} It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or {disfmarker} A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um {disfmarker} Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um {disfmarker} See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So um {disfmarker} D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of {gap} looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the {disfmarker} So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh {disfmarker} Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:And that's it .\nProject Manager:Uh thank you . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it .\nProject Manager:Okay . Thank you . So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay . So these are the points we have to discuss . Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Uh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh a hand dynamo .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But I don't think that's {vocalsound} really an option .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You don't wanna swing before you can watch television .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:so it's not a very good option .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Or the kinetic energy .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up .\nMarketing:You just {disfmarker} You use it and it works .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Nah .\nMarketing:Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . That's true .\nMarketing:And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nMarketing:And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But\nMarketing:Um wel\nUser Interface:what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries {gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah you could load up the batteries ,\nUser Interface:B b\nMarketing:you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .\nUser Interface:Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place .\nMarketing:That's true . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .\nUser Interface:Yeah . That's true . Yeah .\nProject Manager:And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Uh .\nProject Manager:That's safe .\nMarketing:I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's a good point .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .\nProject Manager:Yeah , sure . Go ahead .\nMarketing:Um so it was open here . Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:I would greatly advise not to do it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:younger people .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . It's a bit higher percentage , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .\nProject Manager:Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point .\nUser Interface:But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ?\nMarketing:Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:So pretty large .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information ,\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:and it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And um yeah I think the um {disfmarker} Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the {disfmarker} I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And that's the best choice .\nProject Manager:Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip .\nIndustrial Designer:Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display .\nProject Manager:Just the advanced .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's gotta be advanced .\nProject Manager:Okay\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:{gap} , advanced chip . And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? Um as we saw there is not {disfmarker} Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Look I've got a new remote control , and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh I dunno .\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's right .\nMarketing:if it's just\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:wood-coloured .\nProject Manager:But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm I dunno .\nProject Manager:You don't know ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'll have to uh research .\nProject Manager:I think so because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:Probably .\nProject Manager:It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .\nUser Interface:Mm . Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh {disfmarker} Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So\nProject Manager:Change the cases . Yeah .\nUser Interface:maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You can sell the cases .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the {disfmarker} Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Because that's a {disfmarker} it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:which we can get a great advantage point .\nMarketing:Yeah that is true .\nProject Manager:So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though .\nProject Manager:Costs .\nMarketing:'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . So\nMarketing:So that would {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah {vocalsound} remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .\nMarketing:Well I wouldn't design a telephone\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um\nProject Manager:Remote .\nMarketing:one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem .\nProject Manager:So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? I think that's a good uh good option .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Changing case covers .\nMarketing:Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Could you explain that a little more ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .\nMarketing:And what would single curved and double curved mean ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality .\nMarketing:Okay . So we can pretty much just do whatever we want .\nIndustrial Designer:Pick one you like , yes .\nProject Manager:Mm . Okay .\nMarketing:'Kay . That's good .\nProject Manager:Uh but the form has to be um {disfmarker} It has to {disfmarker} It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ?\nMarketing:No just to lie down .\nUser Interface:{gap} okay .\nProject Manager:And the the cover of the the docking station is also\nMarketing:We'll go for that .\nProject Manager:on top of the television then ? Or not ?\nMarketing:Well or besides it .\nProject Manager:And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:on the the board .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Does somebody have ideas for a form or\nUser Interface:Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:so you could , so your thumb would be easily {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:So that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .\nUser Interface:For uh {disfmarker} Uh for {disfmarker}\nMarketing:For left-handed users also .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah we Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh {vocalsound} uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? Or {disfmarker} Or isn't it ?\nMarketing:For the volume . Um well\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:that could {gap} Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .\nProject Manager:Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult ,\nUser Interface:Yeah okay .\nProject Manager:and then it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff .\nUser Interface:Yeah\nProject Manager:But you have extra buttons .\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So people can get confused .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:That is true .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Especially if they have the same writings on it .\nUser Interface:See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh {disfmarker} For lefties\nProject Manager:Can't we make uh {disfmarker} Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:functions as the normal one ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} You mean um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Then you have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah if {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Let's see if I ca A blank one . And then you get {disfmarker} Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . Uh now I have to think . It's a plus and a min . No it's not very handy I think . Because the plus and the min will be opposite\nUser Interface:Mm no .\nProject Manager:and all kinds of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No that's not gonna work . I guess . Maybe we should {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel\nMarketing:Yeah . That is true .\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . It's just uh u using uh your thumb .\nProject Manager:Y yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:So um it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um yeah\nIndustrial Designer:So I could draw them out .\nProject Manager:just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Let's look at the flat case . Oh . It's from the side so it's rather normal .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . So this type should be better for you or better {disfmarker} Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .\nProject Manager:Easier ?\nIndustrial Designer:And the double curved s looks something like this I guess .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So th those are the three options we have .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle .\nUser Interface:So um {disfmarker} Do you say this um {disfmarker} S uh {disfmarker} Uh you got like uh sort of a {disfmarker} I believe {disfmarker} {gap} There ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think so . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh\nProject Manager:But now it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:we can make it um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you have it upside down or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm ?\nProject Manager:Do you have it\nUser Interface:That's the top .\nProject Manager:this that's top ? Okay .\nUser Interface:So uh this top . This down . Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um {disfmarker} Let's see . Um {disfmarker} Colour uh okay . Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um {disfmarker} Uh it's an {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and\nProject Manager:So get your mouse . Yeah .\nUser Interface:And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh rem\nProject Manager:So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get {disfmarker} {gap} here .\nUser Interface:Yeah but this place um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down .\nUser Interface:Uh it's {disfmarker} Yeah I dunno um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:It's more logical to have it on top as well\nProject Manager:I think i\nIndustrial Designer:because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above .\nUser Interface:Yeah so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:On top .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page .\nProject Manager:{gap} . So\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:then we get {disfmarker} Here's {disfmarker} That's the curve .\nUser Interface:Five minutes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Here the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And then h the rest of the buttons over here .\nUser Interface:Yeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah still here\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:jus\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And I'd prefer the corners to be round .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . 'Kay .\nProject Manager:Should be more bit more friendly ,\nMarketing:Think that would be better .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:Friendly on the eye .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Supplements . That's okay . Where's my mouse ? Then {disfmarker} We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe . The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Which are {disfmarker} Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or {disfmarker} I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And then you'll get a message .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the folders group . Uh yes , it's here .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} SMARTboard , there it it . So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . Thank you .\nMarketing:Very good .\nUser Interface:Okay .\n",
        "summary": "The whole meeting was focused on the conceptual design of the new remote control product. After Project Manager briefly reaffirmed the agreements reached in previous meetings, Marketing, User Interface, and Industrial Designer each gave a presentation about trend-watching, interface design, and components design respectively. Then, Project Manager started a group discussion about important points just covered, including energy source, voice recognition, LCD screen, as well as case design, on which more emphasis was paid in the last half of the meeting. Finally, the group roughly drew out a specific case design.",

        "conversations": "Marketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Right . Okay . Alright . Is everyone here ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yep . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay . This is our conceptual design meeting . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um {vocalsound} and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um and that they often lose the {disfmarker} it's easy to lose a remote . Um which were all things we were thinking we would {disfmarker} wanna make it simple . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And uh some sort of locator . Either a button or tracking device . Um {disfmarker} And that it should look different than what's out there . Um {disfmarker} Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . Um the simple versus the um the complex . The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um {disfmarker} Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different . And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How that would power the remote and the lamp . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , {vocalsound} which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um {disfmarker} I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . {vocalsound} And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also . Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . So {disfmarker} Marketing ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:We're watching trends .\nMarketing:Yep . Can I have your cable please ?\nProject Manager:I suppose that you can have this .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thanks . Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . {vocalsound} Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and {disfmarker} Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} A banana shape ?\nUser Interface:Oh it was sort of banana shaped . {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . And then the spongy feel . I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . C and look at different types of material that {vocalsound} might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . So that's that .\nProject Manager:So possibly like a uh ,\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:sorry , just to butt in for a second . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?\nMarketing:That's what I was thinking yeah .\nUser Interface:Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones .\nProject Manager:You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So when you buy your remote you can buy\nProject Manager:feel to it . {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:various coverings .\nProject Manager:Mm various covers .\nUser Interface:What's it called ? Cust you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} personalised , yeah .\nMarketing:Personalise your remote . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We could leave that to the cover department . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} We all know they've got nothing to do all day .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay . Why can't I see the {disfmarker} crazy . Um yeah I {disfmarker} talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a {disfmarker} there is a picture {gap} . You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there {disfmarker} has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out . And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . That is a {vocalsound} possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know {gap} if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be {disfmarker} need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the {disfmarker} do it {disfmarker} or program all that on the control bit . And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . Um I don't {disfmarker} it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . Stuff like {gap} gets more and more compli complicated . And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . And that is it . Why am I {disfmarker} Oh yeah . Just {gap} . {gap} Where are we ? Uh . Just to sort of show you . M {gap} they've even got things like that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Huge things . Which is just {gap} for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Notice the giant dog bone shape ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:Makes sense , makes sense .\nUser Interface:And that {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Also good for animals .\nUser Interface:Yeah . See . {gap} things {gap} . {gap} . Why's my screen crazy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do . Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . Okay . The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . {vocalsound} The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really {gap} top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um {disfmarker} So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . {vocalsound} Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . Right . Pretty clear . Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . This is the circuit board from the other side . Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . Um you can see the circuit board itself . That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . These are the actual keys that are being pressed . They close the electric circuit . That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . That would be behind here . Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . {vocalsound} Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . And thus gives on the signal . Now this is the simple version . {vocalsound} Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . And not only that . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . Um {vocalsound} I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . So it's pretty squishy . That would that would serve that purpose .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Spongy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um {vocalsound} we could also use wood , or titanium .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh fya\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't have an information on that . However our company {vocalsound} obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It certainly is an expensive material ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm aware of that , but I was given an okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . Right ? Uh a dynamo . Interestingly enough .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um we could use solar cells . Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? Um solar cell is interesting . {vocalsound} May fail though , every here and there .\nUser Interface:Would you have to leave it by the window ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah\nUser Interface:{gap} yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:. Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker} yeah mm .\nProject Manager:Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Always the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Y probably not yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:exactly .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . We don't need that then . Um {disfmarker} However our interface options are push-buttons . In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . Um {disfmarker} However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . And they are possible . We have an okay for scroll wheels . Okay . Um however {vocalsound} when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . This however may exclude certain um materials . If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . Hence we might not be able to put it in there . So um {disfmarker} There's also restrictions {vocalsound} to , when it comes to the chip . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . {vocalsound} So that's for the for the scroll wheel . Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . Let's see now . Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right ? Or is anybody still {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go .\nIndustrial Designer:alright .\nMarketing:No . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Alright .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . Um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Would the sort of {vocalsound} spongy and the the plasticky thing {disfmarker} y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a {disfmarker} it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff .\nMarketing:Mm . Like a covering . Yeah .\nUser Interface:So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know {gap} in plastic . But then where do people hold it ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Just all be sort of spongy .\nMarketing:The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} So you {vocalsound} as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? Like the iPod ?\nIndustrial Designer:You can have an L_C_D_ screen . Um but therefore no rubber will be used .\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright ? So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . Um latex is tricky . Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . Or wood even .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or make it just push-buttons . Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . Maybe not the nicest feel . Or not much originality really .\nProject Manager:So the ru wait the rubbery {disfmarker} we can shape it however we want ? Or the rubbery we cannot ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it ,\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's the tricky thing .\nUser Interface:Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . So that's {gap} thing if we did it yellow .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any {disfmarker} they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing .\nProject Manager:Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?\nIndustrial Designer:S Certainly can be done yes . Um yeah . if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . I assume . Yeah . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The fruit design um {disfmarker} How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . You name it .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:What about a smell ?\nIndustrial Designer:Just design-wise .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:T {vocalsound} to the remote ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Nice one .\nUser Interface:You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . In different ye yellows .\nMarketing:Bright citrus colours yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:I don't suppose we have to stick to co\nIndustrial Designer:Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though ,\nUser Interface:Stick to the colours yeah .\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that's yellow and grey .\nMarketing:Yellow and grey .\nProject Manager:Yellow and grey .\nIndustrial Designer:So what have we , lemon , banana , is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm grapefruit . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Grapefruit .\nIndustrial Designer:Grapefruit\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . But {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager:I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well we kinda do yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {gap} {vocalsound} and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And if it's yellow ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:It's it's yellow . It's curved .\nIndustrial Designer:I it's yellow .\nMarketing:Grey buttons yeah .\nProject Manager:It's sort of {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:couple of couple of grey stripes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over .\nUser Interface:On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey .\nProject Manager:It would look like a banana just sitting on their table .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:There you go .\nProject Manager:Rather than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} rather th {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It could {disfmarker} and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table ,\nMarketing:Oh .\nUser Interface:and then people would always know where it was .\nProject Manager:Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit .\nMarketing:Nice . Could look like a fruit bowl .\nIndustrial Designer:It could be an ape . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Could be ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . we could have a variety of options here .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Do you have more to your presentation ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's pretty much it . I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} there you go .\nProject Manager:Okay . I'm gonna plug in here real quick . If I could .\nIndustrial Designer:Sure . Hang on . There you go .\nProject Manager:Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . Um {disfmarker} ow . Ow .\nMarketing:So is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ?\nUser Interface:Well we sort of {disfmarker} {gap} rid of that because {gap} gonna use a battery . And the base station might not be necessary .\nMarketing:Oh right okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:We can still do that . However {vocalsound} of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:design which we saw there .\nMarketing:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But could be done , of course .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . Probably case um material . And probably a shape also . Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . And what kind of supplements we'll have . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:And we have five minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:a cheap one .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Right ?\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} Um I guess we should pick the case then . If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well what about what you said , like putting the\nUser Interface:Just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:just maybe {disfmarker}\nMarketing:finger grips just on top of the plastic ?\nUser Interface:yeah . Just a little bit of {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay . So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes .\nProject Manager:'Kay . So I guess the case would be plastic , with {disfmarker} Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:M more of a l lamination perhaps . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ?\nUser Interface:Yeah I think so . I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah ? Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . It does .\nProject Manager:'Kay . So {disfmarker} I guess that , is that , is that about it ? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ?\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Here's what's gonna be going on . Um {disfmarker} Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um {disfmarker} Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:maybe and and get us a prototype . Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So that {vocalsound} basically {gap} just be working on the prototype , {vocalsound} uh we'll accomplish your other two actions .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright . {vocalsound} Okay . Let's do it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\n",

        "conversations": "Industrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . Um {vocalsound} I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally ,\nUser Interface:Sorry .\nProject Manager:so uh . Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . Um and that people might want it as as {disfmarker} in addition to their existing remote controls . Um {vocalsound} and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it . And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost . Um . {gap} Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um {disfmarker} the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . Um and and then we'll {disfmarker} as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh {disfmarker} Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh {disfmarker} I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer {disfmarker} they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um {vocalsound} the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . Um now this doesn't {vocalsound} necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . Um it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that {disfmarker} we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway . Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um mm {vocalsound} uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . Um okay , so uh after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um notes sent out and uh etcetera . Okay , so {vocalsound} we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . Um again I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to {disfmarker} who who who thinks they would like to go go first ?\nMarketing:Uh I don't mind . {gap}\nProject Manager:P fine .\nMarketing:Uh can I steal the cable ?\nProject Manager:Oh sorry , you can indeed .\nMarketing:Cheers .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I got a {disfmarker} how do I start there ?\nProject Manager:Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . That one .\nMarketing:That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the {disfmarker} our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um {vocalsound} everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are {disfmarker} how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um {vocalsound} they they don't uh {disfmarker} they , yeah , they only use {disfmarker} they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh {disfmarker} I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . {vocalsound} Uh again , seventy five percent is {disfmarker} seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just {disfmarker} they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume {gap} . {vocalsound} And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use {disfmarker} have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice {disfmarker} the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Maybe don't even have to hold it as such .\nProject Manager:Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would {disfmarker} if people would pay more for speech recognition\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap}\nMarketing:and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our {disfmarker} on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were ,\nProject Manager:Mm . Right . Mm .\nMarketing:so . {vocalsound} May be incrementally emitting , but yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I must say that um the uh {disfmarker} I c can't remember what {vocalsound} um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought\nMarketing:And uh {vocalsound} it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and it it cuts out uh {disfmarker} I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , um {disfmarker} oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost {disfmarker} no ? It's {disfmarker} sorry it's a bit {gap} . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on {disfmarker} or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:which are low relevance\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I mean {disfmarker}\nMarketing:and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It could be {disfmarker} oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Have you seen the new mo mobile phones\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side ,\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nUser Interface:so\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:you could have the most {vocalsound} used buttons on top and flip it out or something .\nProject Manager:Hmm , hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , like the one that like slides back\nProject Manager:Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ?\nMarketing:and the buttons are concealed underneath .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um {vocalsound} remove them altogether .\nMarketing:Just remove them completely ?\nProject Manager:We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That might be the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um now the the age structure we were looking at {disfmarker} um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh yeah .\nProject Manager:Forty {disfmarker} no sorry {disfmarker} for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes we {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um no this is for {disfmarker} pay more for speech recognition .\nProject Manager:That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at {disfmarker} um well again , we don't know the relative proportion {disfmarker} the relative numbers in the age groups .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager:If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it .\nIndustrial Designer:P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change .\nProject Manager:But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It might {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Or even {disfmarker} I mean you could even just have it left on .\nUser Interface:Maybe i\nMarketing:You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:you won't lose it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It c well it {disfmarker} I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} B_B_C_ one . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so it probably needs to be um {disfmarker} possibly actually need a button on it\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's true .\nProject Manager:just to activate it .\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ?\nMarketing:Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer:But look at the importance of them . The volume settings .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Relevance of two out of ten ,\nProject Manager:Vol volume ,\nMarketing:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:yes um\nIndustrial Designer:They're not used often\nProject Manager:th {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but they are quite important when they're used .\nProject Manager:w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} uh would appear to be essential .\nMarketing:Stand out .\nProject Manager:Um . So {disfmarker} if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's {gap} the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option .\nMarketing:Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt .\nProject Manager:Do , please .\nMarketing:Uh you were saying about um it could {disfmarker} technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:we could maybe have like an activation word .\nProject Manager:You cer certainly could .\nMarketing:'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just {disfmarker} you address the remote ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Depe uh i depends whether um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:you address the computer , and then give it a command .\nProject Manager:if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say\nMarketing:Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see .\nProject Manager:B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print {disfmarker} actually print it on the uh\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah .\nProject Manager:device itself . Um .\nMarketing:I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .\nProject Manager:S th this I th {vocalsound} that's always gonna be a problem I think .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um and I I I s so I suppose one um {disfmarker} could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh no\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I I interrupted you ,\nProject Manager:no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:sorry {vocalsound} . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Mm okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the {disfmarker} or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . {gap} alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since {disfmarker} if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd {disfmarker} it would be fashion and fashion over practicality .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . S s we could {disfmarker} we could make it dual function {gap} voice recognition and {gap} still have buttons on it um\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah ,\nProject Manager:'cause we're {disfmarker}\nMarketing:we could even have it as like a {disfmarker} yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Certainly could . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:So uh yeah , if we could uh {disfmarker} power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} The {disfmarker} I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper .\nMarketing:Yeah and probably it would look better as well .\nProject Manager:No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive .\nMarketing:Yeah . yeah .\nProject Manager:Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Lined with numbered buttons and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm , yeah . Okay , who {disfmarker} sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ?\nMarketing:Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything .\nProject Manager:Yep , yep . Um {vocalsound} given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay well , I can do mine .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Do you want the cable ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:F_ eight .\nIndustrial Designer:F_ eight .\nUser Interface:Is it doing {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Dunno .\nMarketing:Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Ah , there we go . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , it's going .\nUser Interface:Oh okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so this is just about the technical functions .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So these are the two different ones . This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top ,\nProject Manager:Mm , yeah .\nUser Interface:then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker} when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , can I um {disfmarker} I'm actually gonna use the um {disfmarker} it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . I'm actually gonna use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:F they probably clip to you .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , they might be movable .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , they're all {disfmarker} they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , rather than the uh the the traditional {disfmarker} in fact , um I won't even go that far . Um something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can {disfmarker} that's sort of a more vertical shape , um that you you sort of hold in your hand , um , well I'm trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as {disfmarker} I mean um something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the uh the infrared or whatever source .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh so that you know , it's flying off in all directions ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:so that uh um uh {vocalsound} again the {disfmarker} n need to look at the the the technicalities of um actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh {disfmarker} such a source , um you know , compromise the {disfmarker} our our need for uh you know , it it being um mm permanently uh you know , available .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh whether whether different technology {disfmarker} um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . Um\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for {disfmarker} i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else . {vocalsound} Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , but again , except that um {disfmarker} you know the risk of losing it . Um anyway okay um so Kate , wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , mm . {gap}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Which one does this plug into ?\nUser Interface:Hmm I think it's all there .\nIndustrial Designer:That one .\nUser Interface:H\nIndustrial Designer:I can't {disfmarker} did you {gap} {disfmarker} could you see it on you screen when it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's not cool . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's kind of strange .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh well . Anyways . Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh . {vocalsound} Oh there we go . Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um and it does this uh by {disfmarker} well , you need {disfmarker} to start off you need an energy source {vocalsound} and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is {disfmarker} that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um {disfmarker} Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , {vocalsound} uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . And um {disfmarker} oops . Uh-huh . This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . Uh this just kinda represents the energy source\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um {vocalsound} a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between {disfmarker} so it'll light up once we start {disfmarker} once you start pressing buttons . Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what ? Sends signals to the the television . And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And so my personal preferences {disfmarker} I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface {vocalsound} um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . And that's pretty much it .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {gap}\nProject Manager:I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . Um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one {disfmarker} some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . By which time {disfmarker} I mean when all's said and done , the digital television {vocalsound} will be taking over in that time scale . Um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , cool . {vocalsound} Yeah , fair enough .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um it's , you know , it's {disfmarker} what it saves in cost and you know there there's a {disfmarker} well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It could have like uh {disfmarker} know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , mm .\nProject Manager:Are are people really gonna use it though ? Um .\nUser Interface:Yeah , people are pro\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I suppose , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I would think that people might forget {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I I th I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there ,\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-mm .\nUser Interface:so .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um {disfmarker} I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . {vocalsound} And that's pretty much {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:When it {disfmarker} yeah , wh when it's died is a problem .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , yeah , {gap} so uh um\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , think that's a good idea .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:Uh . That sounds pretty good , yeah .\nProject Manager:Is the uh {disfmarker} you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here .\nUser Interface:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective .\nUser Interface:Do they make batteries that last that long ?\nProject Manager:I mean th th certainly . Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} They usually have the little light uh {vocalsound} source ,\nProject Manager:but there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno what the heck they're called ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , they have that little solar {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:the {disfmarker} but\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Som well some do ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , the little cells that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I mean th th but there are battery ones\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:that um are you know , sort of permanently sealed .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:In in fact I'd {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light ,\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery ,\nProject Manager:uh uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . Um . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , it depend if it's {disfmarker} uh depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , some people are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:If , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Yeah , {vocalsound} then they're clicking a lot , yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} W\nProject Manager:n\nMarketing:like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Per hour ?\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:times per hour .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Wow . {vocalsound} That's a lot . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh , I must admit I hadn't um {disfmarker} I'd I'd missed that . That does sound excessive .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:But then again , if you think it {disfmarker} of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:That's {disfmarker} it's less than a second , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:or whether it's just a\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . Um .\nUser Interface:Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:channels that way instead of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . Um 'cause we're we're getting\nUser Interface:Uh-oh .\nProject Manager:um {disfmarker} right , so I'd {disfmarker} I need to sum up very quickly here um . {vocalsound} We're looking at extreme simplicity . We're looking at a radically different shape . Possibly no buttons at all um , but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . Um in the {disfmarker} I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if {disfmarker} clearly only need the main functions . Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and {vocalsound} there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . {vocalsound} Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep . Hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . We are doing just the television .\nUser Interface:Oh I just have one question . So are we doing just the television or are we doing {disfmarker} so not D_V_D_ players ,\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:we okay , okay .\nProject Manager:I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:no ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , like in the email of television only . In fact they're {gap} in the constraints email that I got .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ?\nProject Manager:Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh {disfmarker} what came down from from head office . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh {vocalsound} okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's {vocalsound} that that that that's their uh their view .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "This is the second meeting of the design group. Project Manager went through the notes of the last meeting and informed the team of the management's requirements. They expected the remote control to cover television only and asked the team to incorporate the company logo and colours. As the team is looking at extreme simplicity, the buttons should be reduced to the absolute minimum. Voice recognition can also be added to reach this point. In addition, the remote control can be powered by a rechargeable or permanent battery.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh {vocalsound} uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh {vocalsound} just as vital to this project\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:um {vocalsound} I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um {disfmarker} designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um . {vocalsound} What's uh {disfmarker} the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh {vocalsound} everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um {gap} everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh {disfmarker} uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you {disfmarker} you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew .\nMarketing:Oh my name's Andrew I'm a {disfmarker} I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to {gap} like {disfmarker} and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .\nProject Manager:Right {vocalsound} Kendra .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um {vocalsound} I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be {vocalsound} working on the design .\nProject Manager:Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so .\nUser Interface:Right . Yep , I'm just open to being creative .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh I'm Katie ,\nProject Manager:Yep , good .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , very very quickly , um {vocalsound} this {disfmarker} I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . Everybody says what they {gap} what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and think oh yes that's {disfmarker} it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that {disfmarker} I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh {vocalsound} let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um {disfmarker} In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um So I I {disfmarker} everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal .\nMarketing:Um , badger . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm and why ?\nMarketing:Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black {vocalsound} and white and uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:I feel they're {gap} underdog kind of status\nProject Manager:Oh right\nMarketing:and they're , the\nProject Manager:uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um probably a duck\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Kendra .\nUser Interface:I just {disfmarker} I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . Right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh 's horses , no particular reason why {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh , {gap} fair enough yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:because of their {disfmarker} their uh overall ability to uh uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:to make T_V_ remotes {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Indeed absolutely yes ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:tha that's um {disfmarker} Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh {disfmarker} we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . {vocalsound} It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . Um , okay , um {vocalsound} would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls .\nUser Interface:Well I think {disfmarker} I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . Um , but that {disfmarker} it's easy to {gap} if you can switch back and forth instead of having to {vocalsound} press a bunch of different buttons\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker} so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know .\nProject Manager:Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's important that you should be able to {disfmarker} when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it {disfmarker} the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and {gap} T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Like it's very {disfmarker} a very {disfmarker} like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like {disfmarker} Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .\nProject Manager:Um what so wh what's in in {disfmarker} what particular style features are you thinking about ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um . Something that looks looks {disfmarker} doesn't look like remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So if you want , {vocalsound} something that looks like uh {disfmarker} something that makes you think oh what's this ? Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen ,\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:but it makes you think oh .\nProject Manager:{gap} . Yeah\nMarketing:So , sorry that's a bit vague {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , {vocalsound} people won't see it as a remote control um and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a {disfmarker} of remote controls ?\nUser Interface:I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better .\nProject Manager:I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:some from personal experience which look nice\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but {vocalsound} aren't particularly comfortable . Um {vocalsound} any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well from the mouse idea you could , {gap} remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want {gap} {disfmarker} could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button .\nProject Manager:Yes , I mean {vocalsound} the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:I suppose .\nProject Manager:fi find the button buttons easily .\nMarketing:Easily , yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them {disfmarker} be kind of down so you could feel them\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:better .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh {disfmarker} certainly be different . Um do we need it to uh {disfmarker} I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:Do we do we want uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm that would be good .\nUser Interface:Like a like a mobile phone ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm , yeah that would be good .\nProject Manager:Okay . So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um {disfmarker} the planet with ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , um {vocalsound} especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . Oh sorry , four million of 'em , but uh {disfmarker} I think if w if we market it as as not as not {disfmarker} well this {disfmarker} you c you could either market it as the point of view {disfmarker} we could have the two {disfmarker} we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:and like you just {disfmarker} it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:but that might {disfmarker} considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , therefore they want it so {disfmarker} make it practical at the same time . I think it's {disfmarker} this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:uh but also a device that uh is practically sound .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay , yeah , yeah , well\nMarketing:So um , I dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . If you {gap} .\nProject Manager:I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim {disfmarker} need to aim for for all of . Um okay well\nMarketing:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:first thoughts on um the the industrial design side .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh I think it's it's {disfmarker} remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's {disfmarker} you depend on them so much , but you don't {disfmarker} i i it's {disfmarker} you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna {disfmarker} something's gonna get messed up eventually . They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's {gap} {disfmarker} God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Indeed .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it just {disfmarker} it needs to be very effective , very {disfmarker} always dependable . Uh I don't think we should make it too small I {disfmarker} 'cause I think it needs to {gap} it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} so yes dependable , and have a {gap} good medium range size .\nProject Manager:Okay , and um colours , materials ? Kendra , anyone ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well , most {disfmarker} I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface:so maybe we should go with something different or be able to {disfmarker} I was just thinking of um {vocalsound} what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um {disfmarker} what are they called ? Like the face-plates\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:that you change so we could have maybe {disfmarker} I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:so people can get different different things . Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:probably just plastic because that's always the lightest .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay that's uh {disfmarker} Again I don't think that's ever been done before ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it's uh the sort of {gap} the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh might need so . Uh Andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ?\nMarketing:Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with {disfmarker} like you buy it with several uh like you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh {vocalsound} maybe thinking of that , it's {disfmarker} considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing {disfmarker} like a second campaign to market new facials for your {disfmarker} to your {disfmarker} might go a bit astray\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Unless you were trying to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh\nIndustrial Designer:and sorta stagger the release of them\nMarketing:it's {disfmarker} that's a that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Right , okay\nMarketing:Yeah true .\nProject Manager:I think we've got um a good idea now . We uh {disfmarker} meeting is uh {disfmarker} Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . So uh um we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . Uh thank you very much indeed .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {gap} .\n",
        "summary": "This is the first Real Reaction's development meeting for the new remote control. The team members got acquainted with each other and Project Manager introduced the financial target. Each product would be priced at 25 Euros and a 50% profit is made, aiming at making an overall profit of 50 million Euros. In terms of style and design, the remote control should be stylish to stay competitive. Also, it should be made dependable and of medium size and the user interface can be made into face-plates. The material should be plastic as it is the lightest. To market the remote control, the project team can launch parallel marketing schemes to fit both customers who value the remote control's appearance and those who value its practicability. To market interchangeable fronts, the team can either get control in a set of colours or with face-plates.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} Good to see you all again . Let's see if that comes up . This is our functional design meeting . Um . Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up . Et voila . Okay . Mm um we put the fashion in electronics . Let's start . Okay , our agenda today um {disfmarker} just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . Um . I'm gonna do an opening , talk about um {disfmarker} did you all get the minutes ? I e-mailed them to you . I'm also putting 'em {disfmarker} them in the shared folder .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:So um then I {disfmarker} we'll talk about our general objectives\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:and have your three presentations . Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . Finally we'll just close . We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . So {disfmarker} First of all the functional design objectives . Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the {gap} functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um .\nMarketing:{gap} Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ?\nProject Manager:Sure , please do .\nMarketing:I dunno . How do I hook my screen up ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think , you might have to disconnect Rose .\nProject Manager:Yes I do . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there\nMarketing:Where does it go ? Mm-hmm . Hmm , I'm not supposed to move this ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ah that's it , yep .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:And then you have to press function F_ eight\nProject Manager:Function , F_ eight , yeah .\nUser Interface:I think it is on your laptop .\nProject Manager:The blue one , F_N_ .\nMarketing:Where's function ? No signal .\nProject Manager:Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Ah , wait , 's screw in .\nIndustrial Designer:I I think you just have to push it in really hard .\nMarketing:Push the screw .\nUser Interface:That's it .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , got it .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:Mm alright\nProject Manager:It's taking it a little bit {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I've never attached to anything .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , neither have I .\nProject Manager:'Kay there you go .\nMarketing:Alright , so ,\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is . But , I don't even know how to play this . No .\nProject Manager:Press the little presentation . It's the um {disfmarker} it looks like a Y_ kind of {disfmarker} over there above Draw . There , that one , there you go .\nMarketing:Alright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly {vocalsound} , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they {disfmarker} more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . I don't know anything beyond what fancy means ,\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:but that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:Um people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is ,\nUser Interface:Repetitive strain injury .\nMarketing:because I don't know .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Repetitive strain injury .\nMarketing:What ? Ah . There we go .\nUser Interface:So if you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Wow . People do not like that . So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on . So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly {vocalsound} and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Thank you very much . That was that was great .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} 's move on to the next presentation um on effects . Was that you ?\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Great .\nMarketing:Yeah , have I unscrewed it ?\nProject Manager:Push . User interface , right . Interface .\nMarketing:Here we go .\nUser Interface:Cheers .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay , thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , great .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Here we go . Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . Um . Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:and different different people sort of prefer different things . Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:So I had a look on the {disfmarker} on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things {disfmarker} what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can {disfmarker} you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . The one on the right is a lot more basic . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . So we've got to to find our {disfmarker} find a way of striking a balance between the two . Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . It it does everything that I need it to uh , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay . Thank you very much . That was very useful . {vocalsound} It's funny to see the {vocalsound} drastic difference between those two remotes . {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:And neither of them were very pretty , you know ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:I think that could be our selling point .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:A fashion fashion remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You {disfmarker} there it is .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already .\nProject Manager:Lovely .\nMarketing:So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ?\nUser Interface:Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . 'Cause I was like googling\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and then I'm like wait {vocalsound} it won't let me google . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright um {disfmarker} No , how do I play again ?\nProject Manager:Um the {disfmarker} it's right above Draw . There are three thingy if {disfmarker} it's way at the bottom . Under three icons\nIndustrial Designer:Ah .\nProject Manager:and it's the one that looks like a desk . Yeah , that one . There are Y_s {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So this is our working design presentation . Um I had a bit of {disfmarker} some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's {disfmarker} we're still in early stages . Um so , yeah , this is this . Though th the thing about working design is the {disfmarker} what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but {disfmarker} how do I get to the next s ah . So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . So um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You just press {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . Uh .\nProject Manager:yeah , just click . That'll be fine .\nIndustrial Designer:So the findings that I got uh very {disfmarker} just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . So that's one thing we're gonna work on . Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls {disfmarker} that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip {disfmarker} ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh .\nProject Manager:Um yeah use that thing {gap} you can go back , previous .\nIndustrial Designer:Previous . Sorry about that , guys .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Pardon .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:Oh , well .\nIndustrial Designer:No , no , no , no , no .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , let's just get back to my schematic here .\nProject Manager:Ye Double click on it . With the right {disfmarker} with the left hand one .\nIndustrial Designer:W yeah , yeah . I think it's frozen . Here . Don't show me that tip again .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} There we are .\nIndustrial Designer:There we are . Sorry about this , guys .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm kind of pathetic with things like this . Um alright . So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . And {vocalsound} personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated . We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . So that's pretty much it for the working design .\nProject Manager:Excellent . {gap} So , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ?\nProject Manager:Yes , absolutely . Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Lefty loosey , righty tighty , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What's up ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Lefty loosey , righty tighty .\nUser Interface:Lefty loosey . Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Never heard that before ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh yes .\nUser Interface:that's good . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'll think of that every time now .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's gonna stick in your head .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , that's a good one it'll stick with you .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay . Um I have nothing on my screen . Just a sec . Here we are .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Ooh ,\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah , it's fine .\nIndustrial Designer:no signal .\nProject Manager:Okay , requirements . We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um {disfmarker} well it {disfmarker} that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about um {disfmarker} we're not gonna worry about that .\nMarketing:What's teletext ?\nProject Manager:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , it's a British thing .\nMarketing:Oh . Oh ,\nUser Interface:You don't have it in the States ?\nMarketing:so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:no . W d could {disfmarker} would you care to explain it ?\nUser Interface:Oh , I didn't realise . Um yeah , it's like a {disfmarker} I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , uh y and you type in the page number you want ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:S {vocalsound} Lottery numbers and sport scores .\nUser Interface:Yep , news headlines .\nIndustrial Designer:But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about .\nProject Manager:How ?\nUser Interface:It's earl it's pretty old technology .\nMarketing:Oh .\nUser Interface:It's like nineteen eighties .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:That explains a lot .\nIndustrial Designer:I have no idea why we don't have it , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's good .\nProject Manager:Interesting . Okay um , well , we're not gonna {disfmarker} the management has decided we're not gonna work with that . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Um otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out um very quickly . We only have a a short amount of time .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:So what's our corporate image like ? It's {disfmarker} It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics .\nProject Manager:Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that {disfmarker} the emphasis on the R_s in um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's like double R_ .\nProject Manager:mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But it's , yeah , we put the um fashion in electronics . So we gotta keep that in that in mind .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so we want something that looks good\nProject Manager:Yep . Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:and is yellow .\nProject Manager:Yeah , or {vocalsound} ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um . Okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . We need to decide who our target group is . You um in your analysis of different market um {disfmarker} of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:or had certain preferences , for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition , but younger people did .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um and so who are we aiming this at ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion {disfmarker} we put the fashion in in electronics then you {disfmarker} automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that {disfmarker} that's {disfmarker} who's gonna be attracted to this .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Is it {disfmarker} is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it .\nProject Manager:Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself .\nUser Interface:Right . Right , okay .\nMarketing:The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Now , those are {disfmarker} that's all specific for speech recognition . Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?\nUser Interface:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:uh , well , uh we've got a price limit of {disfmarker} was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for {disfmarker} to produce it ?\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:To produce it , yeah .\nProject Manager:To produce it , yes .\nUser Interface:And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:But what else are we gonna put , I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . So like other than just making it look good , how is it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} right .\nMarketing:and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That's a good thing to keep in mind .\nIndustrial Designer:in fact it could use {disfmarker} it could mean , not . If {vocalsound} {disfmarker} they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .\nMarketing:If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? I dunno .\nProject Manager:Upgrade ? Well , we can look for {disfmarker} we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , simplification .\nProject Manager:Simplification ,\nIndustrial Designer:They could have a crap remote\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh , mm . And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Can you like {disfmarker} I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons ,\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh .\nMarketing:but the rest of them like went in .\nUser Interface:The remote {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Do you know what I'm saying ?\nProject Manager:Kind of pull out of the side .\nUser Interface:There are remote controls like that , yeah . Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:that hides all the complicated buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh .\nUser Interface:So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and there's all the {disfmarker} all the special buttons .\nMarketing:'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's a good idea .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:more complicated ones ,\nUser Interface:I think that's a good idea , yeah .\nMarketing:but 's all still in one .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information , but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing . Um .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Good point .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay um , so what are we emphasising ? I {disfmarker} what in this project ?\nUser Interface:Si simplicity and fashion .\nProject Manager:Simplicity and fashion .\nMarketing:I think simplicity , fashion .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah mm .\nProject Manager:Okay , those are very good goals , I think , um that we have to keep in mind in {disfmarker} with everything we do . Simplicity and fashion and , yeah , {disfmarker} or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around a lot .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? I'm just wondering .\nProject Manager:I think it's a lot {vocalsound} to do with battery , but that's just my {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The battery and that {disfmarker} I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So 's just the quality of the chip .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I think so .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The quality {vocalsound} uh quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything {disfmarker} shoddy work , 'cause it's\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:gonna be visible down the line .\nProject Manager:So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?\nMarketing:Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:S voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah . I don't .\nProject Manager:like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know .\nUser Interface:It's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-mm .\nProject Manager:Seems a little bit {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and it might be too expensive .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I\nMarketing:Maybe {disfmarker} I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:which isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something .\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:Under sixty five , okay ,\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:that's a good start . Um . I'd say we're {disfmarker} uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? 'Cause that would go up to like fifty ?\nIndustrial Designer:Or like single professionals or something .\nProject Manager:Okay , single {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Twenty to like fifty five .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I dunno .\nProject Manager:It's it's hard to narrow it down .\nIndustrial Designer:It's really hard to figure out right now .\nUser Interface:I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:and that might be older people ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah aim for a {disfmarker} an income group .\nIndustrial Designer:That's a good point .\nMarketing:like , well\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:obviously it has to be someone who owns a television ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , t probably .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but {disfmarker} Okay . Um oh , there're a couple functions {disfmarker} do we want something so that {disfmarker} do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? Like a button on a T_V_ you can press\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and it'll ring or something , I don't know like {disfmarker} or beep ?\nMarketing:H I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that'll probably be good .\nMarketing:so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , we have to {disfmarker} we have about four minutes left to define our functions . So let's do that quickly . Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:And {vocalsound} we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . Large , accessible buttons for the essentials .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Um , yeah , hidden way . And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap} on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager:Okay , do it . Any other essential functions that we need ? Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ?\nIndustrial Designer:Battery battery use . Yeah , but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But we might as well .\nMarketing:So you never have to change the battery .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . I suspect the remote control does need a battery ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , I would imagine .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but I dunno if you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It {disfmarker} I think it does . I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one .\nUser Interface:Yeah , without the energy , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You could {disfmarker} we could maybe do that instead .\nProject Manager:Charging .\nIndustrial Designer:So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it {vocalsound} it stays in one place .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:We have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:I mean , would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? I don't know , just think {disfmarker} okay , that's {vocalsound} that's a good idea , we'll keep it . Think it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That's just off the top of my head .\nProject Manager:And maybe fun . Okay . Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions and {disfmarker} 'kay .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries {disfmarker} summary . I don't know what summarisation . Um and then we'll have our lunch break . After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great . Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could . It's kinda frustrating ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , who knows .\nProject Manager:but um {disfmarker} Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Sounds good .\nProject Manager:Great seeing y'all . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Did you um {disfmarker} were you able to like put yours in the group folder ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , I just did that .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Hopefully it is there for people .\nMarketing:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nProject Manager:Looks like there are um {disfmarker} looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's {disfmarker} that I didn't do ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it's from like an earlier project , I think so um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Where is that ? Yours is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Under the shared folder , I don't know it might not even be under yours as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Technical . So\nProject Manager:Projects .\nIndustrial Designer:in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . At least that's what I have in .\nMarketing:I only have three , I just have like our three . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's what I have as well , R Rose {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . You don't have mine ?\nIndustrial Designer:So .\nMarketing:No , but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server .\nProject Manager:S\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there . Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . Well I'll figure that out in the meantime .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\n",
        "summary": "This was the second meeting with functional design discussion purpose. Firstly, the group gave three individual presentations on working design, technical functions and functional requirements. They mentioned the importance of the fancy appeal, the practicality and the quality of components. Then, the group had a discussion about general requirements on the remote control. The group decided to market the remote as a separate product and focused on the user-friendly as well as simplicity, instead of too much technological advancement. Also, they agreed to target on income group and would add extra functionalities like keep lost and rechargeable stations for the remote control.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:So uh good morning .\nUser Interface:Morning .\nMarketing:Morning .\nProject Manager:I see you all find your places .\nIndustrial Designer:Morning .\nProject Manager:Is everybody sitting on the right place ? Yeah ?\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:I guess so . So {disfmarker} Let's see . First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh {disfmarker} if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart ,\nMarketing:My name's Frank .\nProject Manager:hello . Hello .\nUser Interface:I'm {gap} .\nProject Manager:Bart . Hello . Hello . Bart .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Welcome .\nMarketing:Thank you .\nProject Manager:Uh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation . Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . You can see there are a few cameras here . They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off . Is being modified by the administrator . Uh okay {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Hmm , that's interesting .\nProject Manager:Let's do it read only . Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart {gap} the project manager so I'll direct you through the project . This is our agenda . {vocalsound} Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or {disfmarker} Let's see . Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while .\nMarketing:Sure .\nProject Manager:I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Yep . Visit it .\nProject Manager:Have you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one . {vocalsound} No ?\nUser Interface:Hmm ?\nMarketing:Can't say I paid much attention to it ,\nProject Manager:I can see if it works this way . No , it doesn't work here .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay no problem . But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh {disfmarker} there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction .\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:Real Remote is not really the company we're {disfmarker} we are , but it's just a little {gap} fault .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um okay , what are we going to do ? {vocalsound} Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . {vocalsound} We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original . {vocalsound} And we've got our User Interface Designer .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:He's also uh {disfmarker} That's about the new remote control . Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . {vocalsound} I had some role indications on here . But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . {vocalsound} And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project {disfmarker} uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Then we've got our first tool training . {vocalsound} We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the {disfmarker} think it is form of .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:You can also select the current colour and the line width . But then first you have to select the pen function .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:But we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . {vocalsound} Uh then a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , project {gap} project {disfmarker} what was it ? Project documents {gap} I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings . And then we're going to try out the white board .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So as you can see we g all {vocalsound} going to draw a animal . {vocalsound} Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mouse wasn't running away . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That was interesting .\nProject Manager:Is everybody {disfmarker} is anybody playing with the mouse ? No .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Innocent .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We're going to uh draw animal . {vocalsound} And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh there's {disfmarker} I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . Then the line width . I think seven will be nice . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:These are not very much , but uh {disfmarker} Uh , see you have to do it real slow . {vocalsound} Oh {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Sure .\nProject Manager:Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but I think his nose has to be a little bit {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But it's close .\nMarketing:I'm thinking about a swordfish .\nProject Manager:So what {disfmarker} yeah it's {disfmarker} this is bit of the swordfish .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , he hasn't got an eye .\nUser Interface:{gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Woah . {vocalsound} Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And then you can undo this easily .\nMarketing:Meat .\nProject Manager:Ah it's okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . Uh is {disfmarker} They've got no text tool , no . Uh . {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This is typically a undo action , I think . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Pen . Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . But I don't know , I'm just trying . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} This is not my work ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Maybe you have to use {disfmarker} Oh .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh . I think it's a {disfmarker} it wants to draw a {disfmarker} another animal ? I don't know . It lives for the fun . So {disfmarker} It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Go ahead .\nMarketing:Thank you . Okay . Gonna use a different line width . And I'm gonna draw in black . There . 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go .\nProject Manager:Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Because this is going a lot better than uh I did .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A sheep .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:This is my um {disfmarker} Hmm . Sheep .\nProject Manager:It's nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:With of course\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh .\nMarketing:little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's a real dead sheep ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:There .\nProject Manager:yeah . {vocalsound} For recognition ,\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:yeah , I see . {vocalsound} Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:On just a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:They are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Come on . You have to go really slow when you're writing .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:They're brilliant animal animals .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:And that's just a little me thingy . So . Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer .\nProject Manager:Nice .\nUser Interface:Okay . Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head , but mm {disfmarker} Let's see . Mm . Uh . {gap} Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Sweet . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Interesting .\nUser Interface:You know what that is ? Or who ?\nIndustrial Designer:Garfield .\nMarketing:A rabbit ?\nUser Interface:Ah okay , yeah .\nMarketing:Garfield . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Just a {disfmarker} Mm . Guess . So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . That's enough . {vocalsound} Um , you say a blank ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , just a blank sheet .\nUser Interface:or {disfmarker} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll just try something else .\nProject Manager:No . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Something different than Garfield .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mine is a bit more skinny . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's pretty skinny cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And the most interesting tail .\nProject Manager:Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , it's supposed to be a cat . I like cats because uh they are uh independent .\nProject Manager:Ah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The pen . So .\nProject Manager:Okay . That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:The pen . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and go ahead . It's pretty uh easy .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:S {gap}\nMarketing:We're being haunted .\nProject Manager:haunted white board . {vocalsound} So we've got the tool uh introduction . We move along to the project finance .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium . Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . It won't work . So just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros . So that's leads us to our little discussion . We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . So I'm gonna sit down , I think . It's easier .\nMarketing:Yeah , you got a message .\nProject Manager:I've got a message . Five minutes . Okay ,\nUser Interface:Five minutes , okay .\nProject Manager:that's uh good timing . {vocalsound} {gap}\nMarketing:So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?\nUser Interface:Mm ?\nProject Manager:Uh maybe you have to say the magic word . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Right .\nProject Manager:Does it do anything ?\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Maybe you have to just clap it down ? Mm back up again . No slide show . Hmm .\nMarketing:It's off now .\nProject Manager:It's off . Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah . You'll be okay , I think .\nMarketing:Well , it was on , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well it's those laptops . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ah , there we are .\nProject Manager:Nice . Okay . {vocalsound} But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm . Oh really ?\nProject Manager:No ?\nUser Interface:Huh .\nProject Manager:You ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No , me neither .\nMarketing:Well , we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player .\nProject Manager:Ah yeah .\nMarketing:And I think it's {disfmarker} it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .\nProject Manager:Yep . Yeah\nUser Interface:Sure . Yeah .\nProject Manager:I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor .\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah .\nMarketing:Oh\nProject Manager:So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um\nMarketing:really .\nUser Interface:Hmm . Oh . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:thing . {vocalsound} Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nProject Manager:That's good to remember .\nMarketing:So I think you can take minutes again .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's nice , I think . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Since it's your job .\nProject Manager:So we've {disfmarker} we want different functions\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah . But that would be really good if we could do that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And other functions for a remote control ? Maybe we can make it uh uh\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um . Think it has to be shock proof\nUser Interface:Sure , yeah .\nMarketing:'cause\nProject Manager:Shock proof .\nMarketing:my remote control tends to fall a lot .\nUser Interface:Waterproof , or uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Sure .\nUser Interface:Uh , you never no know uh ,\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I w I mean uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Waterproof . Okay . So these are our um a few things we can think of . Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nMarketing:Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .\nProject Manager:That's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So you can see\nProject Manager:battery stays .\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah .\nMarketing:how much is left in the battery . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh .\nMarketing:But maybe just a little LED , I don't know .\nProject Manager:That's an idea as well . Other ideas ? Quick ideas .\nIndustrial Designer:Nope .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:They were all mentioned ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Any questions about this uh presentation ? Kick off presentation .\nMarketing:Um . Nope , don't think so .\nProject Manager:No ?\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . Finish meeting now . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:And we can all work uh on our own projects . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Aye sir .\nProject Manager:Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think .\nMarketing:Half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So good luck . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yep .\n",
        "summary": "The whole meeting was the initial meeting of a new remote control project. Firstly, Project Manager introduced the scope and agenda of the project, and the team got acquainted with each other and technical devices. Then Project Manager made clear that remote control would be priced at 25 Euros and a production cost of 12.5 Euros, in order to achieve a profit aim of 50 million Euros. After an accident, Marketing suggested that remote control should be made multipurpose and the consensus was reached on this point. Finally, the group brainstormed some other functions for the remote control despite a potential increase in production cost.",

There 's two sheets of paper in front of us .\nPhD A:What are these ?\nPhD E:Yeah . So .\nProfessor B:This is the arm wrestling ?\nPhD C:Uh . Yeah , we formed a coalition actually .\nPhD E:Yeah . Almost .\nPhD C:We already made it into one .\nProfessor B:Oh , good .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Excellent .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor B:That 's the best thing .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:So , tell me about it .\nPhD E:So it 's {disfmarker} well , it 's {pause} spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , um , depending on if we put {disfmarker} if we square the transfer function or not .\nProfessor B:Right .\nPhD E:And then with over - estimation of the noise , depending on the , uh {disfmarker} the SNR , with smoothing along time , um , smoothing along frequency .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:It 's very simple , smoothing things .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:And , um , {vocalsound} the best result is {vocalsound} when we apply this procedure on FFT bins , uh , with a Wiener filter .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:And there is no noise addition after {disfmarker} after that .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD E:So it 's good because {vocalsound} {vocalsound} it 's difficult when we have to add noise to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to find the right level .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD A:Are you looking at one in {disfmarker} in particular of these two ?\nPhD E:Yeah . So the sh it 's the sheet that gives fifty - f three point sixty - six .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:Um , {vocalsound} the second sheet is abo uh , about the same . It 's the same , um , idea but it 's working on mel bands , {vocalsound} and it 's a spectral subtraction instead of Wiener filter , and there is also a noise addition after , uh , cleaning up the mel bins . Mmm . Well , the results are similar .\nProfessor B:Yeah . I mean , {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} {comment} it 's actually , uh , very similar .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:I mean , {vocalsound} if you look at databases , uh , the , uh , one that has the smallest {disfmarker} smaller overall number is actually better on the Finnish and Spanish , uh , but it is , uh , worse on the , uh , Aurora {disfmarker}\nPhD E:It 's worse on {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:I mean on the , uh , TI - TI - digits ,\nPhD E:on the multi - condition in TI - digits . Yeah .\nProfessor B:uh , uh . Um .\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor B:So , it probably doesn't matter that much either way . But , um , when you say u uh , unified do you mean , uh , it 's one piece of software now , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD E:So now we are , yeah , setting up the software .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:Um , it should be ready , uh , very soon . Um , and we\nPhD A:So what 's {disfmarker} what 's happened ? I think I 've missed something .\nProfessor B:OK . So a week ago {disfmarker} maybe you weren't around when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when Hynek and Guenther and I {disfmarker} ?\nPhD C:Hynek was here .\nPhD A:Yeah . I didn't .\nProfessor B:Oh , OK . So {disfmarker} Yeah , let 's summarize . Um {disfmarker} And then if I summarize somebody can tell me if I 'm wrong , which will also be possibly helpful . What did I just press here ? I hope this is still working .\nPhD E:p - p - p\nProfessor B:We , uh {disfmarker} we looked at , {nonvocalsound} uh {disfmarker} anyway we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} after coming back from QualComm we had , you know , very strong feedback and , uh , I think it was {vocalsound} Hynek and Guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . But given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to {pause} choose one .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . Mmm .\nProfessor B:Uh , and so , uh , th the vector Taylor series hadn't really worked out that much . Uh , the subspace stuff , uh , had not been worked with so much . Um , so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus Wiener filtering .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nProfessor B:Uh , we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d uh , completely different .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:And , uh , I mean , fundamentally they 're the same sort of thing but the math is a little different so that there 's a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's an exponent difference in the index {disfmarker} you know , what 's the ideal filtering , and depending on how you construct the problem .\nPhD A:Uh - huh .\nProfessor B:And , uh , I guess it 's sort {disfmarker} you know , after {disfmarker} after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me because {vocalsound} um , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gonna choose your error ? And typically you 'll do {disfmarker} choose something like a variance . And so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra . Whereas when you 're {disfmarker} when you 're doing the {disfmarker} the , uh , um , {vocalsound} looking at it the other way , you 're gonna be dealing with signals\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:and you 're gonna end up looking at power {disfmarker} uh , noise power that you 're trying to reduce . And so , eh {disfmarker} so there should be a difference {vocalsound} of {disfmarker} you know , conceptually of {disfmarker} of , uh , a factor of two in the exponent .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of {disfmarker} of , uh , {vocalsound} uh , over - subtraction and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and so forth , um , that {vocalsound} arguably , you 're c and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and the choice of do you {disfmarker} do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the FFT beforehand . There 're so many other choices to make that are {disfmarker} are almost {disfmarker} well , if not independent , certainly in addition to {pause} the choice of whether you , uh , do spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , that , um , {vocalsound} @ @ again we sort of felt the gang should just sort of figure out which it is they wanna do and then let 's pick it , go forward with it . So that 's {disfmarker} that was {disfmarker} that was last week . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and , uh , we said , uh , take a week , go arm wrestle , you know ,\nGrad D:Oh .\nProfessor B:figure it out . I mean , and th the joke there was that each of them had specialized in one of them .\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nProfessor B:And {disfmarker} and so they {disfmarker} so instead they went to Yosemite and bonded , and {disfmarker} and they came out with a single {disfmarker} single piece of software . So it 's {vocalsound} another {disfmarker} another victory for international collaboration . So .\nPhD A:So {disfmarker} so you guys have combined {disfmarker} or you 're going to be combining the software ?\nProfessor B:Uh .\nPhD C:Well , the piece of software has , like , plenty of options ,\nPhD E:Oh boy .\nPhD C:like you can parse command - line arguments . So depending on that , it {disfmarker} it becomes either spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering .\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nPhD C:So , ye\nPhD A:They 're close enough .\nProfessor B:Well , that 's fine , but the thing is {disfmarker} the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you {disfmarker} that we all will be using now .\nPhD C:Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B:Yes .\nPhD C:There 's just one piece of software .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD E:I need to allow it to do everything and even more {disfmarker} more than this .\nPhD C:Right .\nPhD E:Well , if we want to , like , optimize different parameters of {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Parameters . Yeah .\nProfessor B:Sure .\nPhD E:Yeah , we can do it later . But , still {disfmarker} so , there will be a piece of software with , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , will give this system , the fifty - three point sixty - six , by default and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:How {disfmarker} how is {disfmarker} how good is that ?\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't have a sense of {disfmarker}\nPhD E:It 's just one percent off of the {pause} best proposal .\nPhD C:Best system .\nPhD E:It 's between {disfmarker} i we are second actually if we take this system .\nPhD A:OK .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD E:Right ?\nPhD A:Compared to the last evaluation numbers ? Yeah .\nProfessor B:But , uh {disfmarker} w which we sort of were before\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B:but we were considerably far behind . And the thing is , this doesn't have neural net in yet for instance . You know ?\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nProfessor B:So it {disfmarker} so , um , it 's {disfmarker} it it 's not using our full bal bag of tricks , if you will .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:And , uh , and it {disfmarker} it is , uh , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before . Uh , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , uh , {vocalsound} we didn't have any explicit noise , uh , handling {disfmarker} stationary {disfmarker} dealing with {disfmarker} e e we didn't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:And now we do .\nPhD A:So will the {pause} neural net operate on the output from either the Wiener filtering or the spectral subtraction ? Or will it operate on the original ?\nProfessor B:Well , so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so argu arguably , I mean , what we should do {disfmarker} I mean , I gather you have {disfmarker} it sounds like you have a few more days of {disfmarker} of nailing things down with the software and so on . But {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} but , um , {vocalsound} arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things , th these things I would guess , and not change that .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:And then focus on {pause} everything that 's left . And I think , you know , that our goal should be by next week , when Hynek comes back , {vocalsound} uh , to {disfmarker} uh , really just to have a firm path , uh , for the {disfmarker} you know , for the time he 's gone , of {disfmarker} of , uh , what things will be attacked . But I would {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} I would thought think that what we would wanna do is not futz with this stuff for a while because what 'll happen is we 'll change many other things in the system ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:and then we 'll probably wanna come back to this and possibly make some other choices . But , um .\nPhD A:But just conceptually , where does the neural net go ? Do {disfmarker} do you wanna h run it on the output of the spectrally subtracted {disfmarker} ?\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor B:Well , depending on its size {disfmarker} Well , one question is , is it on the , um , server side or is it on the terminal side ? Uh , if it 's on the server side , it {disfmarker} you probably don't have to worry too much about size .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:So that 's kind of an argument for that . We do still , however , have to consider its latency . So the issue is {disfmarker} is , um , {vocalsound} for instance , could we have a neural net that only looked at the past ?\nPhD A:Right .\nProfessor B:Um , what we 've done in uh {disfmarker} in the past is to use the neural net , uh , to transform , {vocalsound} um , all of the features that we use . So this is done early on . This is essentially , {vocalsound} um , um {disfmarker} I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's more or less like a spee a speech enhancement technique here {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:right ? {disfmarker} where we 're just kind of creating {vocalsound} new {disfmarker} if not new speech at least new {disfmarker} new FFT 's that {disfmarker} that have {disfmarker} you know , which could be turned into speech {disfmarker} uh , that {disfmarker} that have some of the noise removed .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Um , after that we still do a mess of other things to {disfmarker} to produce a bunch of features .\nPhD A:Right .\nProfessor B:And then those features are not now currently transformed {vocalsound} by the neural net . And then the {disfmarker} the way that we had it in our proposal - two before , we had the neural net transformed features and we had {vocalsound} the untransformed features , which I guess you {disfmarker} you actually did linearly transform with the KLT ,\nPhD E:Yeah . Yeah . Right .\nProfessor B:but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} uh , to orthogonalize them {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but they were not , uh , processed through a neural net . And Stephane 's idea with that , as I recall , was that {vocalsound} you 'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:uh , which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when , uh , the testing set was quite different than what you 'd trained your discriminant features for . So , um , all of that is {disfmarker} is , uh {disfmarker} still seems like a good idea . The thing is now we know some other constraints . We can't have unlimited amounts of latency . Uh , y you know , that 's still being debated by the {disfmarker} by people in Europe but , {vocalsound} uh , no matter how they end up there , it 's not going to be unlimited amounts ,\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:so we have to be a little conscious of that . Um . So there 's the neural net issue . There 's the VAD issue . And , uh , there 's the second stream {pause} thing . And I think those that we {disfmarker} last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get , uh , focused on .\nPhD A:What was the issue with the VAD ?\nProfessor B:Well , better {comment} ones are good .\nPhD A:And so the w the default , uh , boundaries that they provide are {disfmarker} they 're OK , but they 're not all that great ?\nProfessor B:I guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some ? Is that what the deal is ?\nPhD E:Mm - hmm . Uh , so th um , they keep two hundred milliseconds at the beginning and end of speech . And they keep all the {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Outside the beginnings and end .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nPhD A:Uh - huh .\nPhD E:And all the speech pauses , which is {disfmarker} Sometimes on the SpeechDat - Car you have pauses that are more than one or two seconds .\nPhD A:Wow .\nPhD E:More than one second for sure . Um .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nPhD E:Yeah . And , yeah , it seems to us that this way of just dropping the beginning and end is not {disfmarker} We cou we can do better , I think ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:because , um , {vocalsound} with this way of dropping the frames they improve {pause} over the baseline by fourteen percent and {vocalsound} Sunil already showed that with our current VAD we can improve by more than twenty percent .\nPhD A:On top of the VAD that they provide ?\nPhD C:No .\nPhD E:Just using either their VAD or our current VAD .\nPhD C:Our way .\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nPhD E:So , our current VAD is {disfmarker} is more than twenty percent , while their is fourteen .\nPhD A:Theirs is fourteen ? I see .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nPhD A:Huh .\nPhD E:So . Yeah . And {pause} another thing that we did also is that we have all this training data for {disfmarker} let 's say , for SpeechDat - Car . We have channel zero which is clean , channel one which is far - field microphone . And if we just take only the , um , VAD probabilities computed on the clean signal and apply them on the far - field , uh , test utterances , {vocalsound} then results are much better .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:In some cases it divides the error rate by two .\nPhD A:Wow .\nPhD E:So it means that there are stim {comment} still {disfmarker}\nPhD A:How {disfmarker} how much latency does the , uh {disfmarker} does our VAD add ?\nPhD E:If {disfmarker} if we can have a good VAD , well , it would be great .\nPhD A:Is it significant ,\nPhD E:Uh , right now it 's , um , a neural net with nine frames .\nPhD A:or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD E:So it 's forty milliseconds plus , um , the rank ordering , which , uh , should be\nPhD C:Like another ten frames .\nPhD E:ten {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad D:Rank . Oh .\nPhD E:So , right now it 's one hundred and forty {pause} milliseconds .\nProfessor B:With the rank ordering {disfmarker} ? I 'm sorry .\nPhD C:The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the smoothing {disfmarker} the m the {disfmarker} the filtering of the probabilities .\nPhD E:The {disfmarker} The , um {disfmarker}\nPhD C:on the R .\nPhD E:Yeah . It 's not a median filtering . It 's just {disfmarker} We don't take the median value . We take something {disfmarker} Um , so we have eleven , um , frames .\nProfessor B:Oh , this is for the VAD .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD E:And {disfmarker} for the VAD , yeah {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Oh , OK .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD E:and we take th the third .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nGrad D:Dar\nPhD E:Um .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Um . So {disfmarker} {comment} Yeah , I was just noticing on this that it makes reference to delay .\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor B:So what 's the {disfmarker} ? If you ignore {disfmarker} Um , the VAD is sort of in {disfmarker} in parallel , isn't i isn't it , with {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} ? I mean , it isn't additive with the {disfmarker} the , uh , LDA and the Wiener filtering , and so forth .\nPhD C:The LDA ?\nProfessor B:Right ?\nPhD C:Yeah . So {disfmarker} so what happened right now , we removed the delay of the LDA .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD C:So we {disfmarker} I mean , if {disfmarker} so if we {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} so which is like if we reduce the delay of VA So , the f the final delay 's now ba is f determined by the delay of the VAD , because the LDA doesn't have any delay . So if we re if we reduce the delay of the VAD , I mean , it 's like effectively reducing the delay .\nPhD A:How {disfmarker} how much , uh , delay was there on the LDA ?\nPhD C:So the LDA and the VAD both had a hundred millisecond delay . So and they were in parallel , so which means you pick either one of them {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Mmm .\nPhD C:the {disfmarker} the biggest , whatever .\nPhD A:I see .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:So , right now the LDA delays are more .\nProfessor B:And there {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nProfessor B:And there didn't seem to be any , uh , penalty for that ? There didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal ?\nPhD C:Pardon ? Oh , no . It actually made it , like , point one percent better or something , actually .\nProfessor B:OK . Well , may as well , then .\nPhD C:Or something like that\nProfessor B:And he says Wiener filter is {disfmarker} is forty milliseconds delay .\nPhD C:and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:So is it {disfmarker} ?\nPhD C:Yeah . So that 's the one which Stephane was discussing , like {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor B:The smoothing ?\nPhD C:Yeah . The {disfmarker} you smooth it and then delay the decision by {disfmarker} So .\nProfessor B:Right . OK . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's really not {disfmarker} not bad . So we may in fact {disfmarker} we 'll see what they decide . We may in fact have , {vocalsound} um , the {disfmarker} the , uh , latency time available for {disfmarker} to have a neural net . I mean , sounds like we probably will . So .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:That 'd be good . Cuz I {disfmarker} cuz it certainly always helped us before . So .\nPhD A:What amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that ?\nProfessor B:Uh . Well , they 're {disfmarker} you know , they 're disputing it .\nPhD A:Mmm .\nProfessor B:You know , they 're saying , uh {disfmarker} one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds . Two hundred and fifty is what it was before actually . So ,\nPhD A:Oh .\nProfessor B:uh , some people are lobbying {disfmarker} lobbying {comment} to make it shorter .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nProfessor B:Um . And , um .\nPhD A:Were you thinking of the two - fifty or the one - thirty when you said we should {pause} have enough for the neural net ?\nProfessor B:Well , it just {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it , is all .\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nProfessor B:I mean , how much effort do we put into making it causal ? I mean , {vocalsound} I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:But , um , it will probably work to some extent to look only at the past . And we ha you know , limited machine and human time , and {vocalsound} effort . And , you know , how {disfmarker} how much time should we put into {disfmarker} into that ? So it 'd be helpful if we find out from the {disfmarker} the standards folks whether , you know , they 're gonna restrict that or not .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Um . But I think , you know , at this point our major concern is making the performance better and {disfmarker} and , um , {vocalsound} if , uh , something has to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that 's {pause} you know , a secondary issue .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:But if we get told otherwise then , you know , we may have to c clamp down a bit more .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nPhD C:So , the one {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one difference is that {disfmarker} was there is like we tried computing the delta and then doing the frame - dropping .\nGrad D:S\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:The earlier system was do the frame - dropping and then compute the delta on the {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:So this {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Which could be a kind of a funny delta . Right ?\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Oh , oh . So that 's fixed in this . Yeah , we talked about that .\nPhD C:Yeah . So we have no delta . And then {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Yeah . Uh - huh .\nProfessor B:Good .\nPhD C:So the frame - dropping is the last thing that we do . So , yeah , what we do is we compute the silence probability , convert it to that binary flag ,\nProfessor B:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:and then in the end you c up upsample it to {vocalsound} match the final features number of {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:Did that help then ?\nPhD C:It seems to be helping on the well - matched condition . So that 's why this improvement I got from the last result . So . And it actually r reduced a little bit on the high mismatch , so in the final weightage it 's b b better because the well - matched is still weighted more than {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:So , @ @ I mean , you were doing a lot of changes . Did you happen to notice how much , {vocalsound} uh , the change was due to just this frame - dropping problem ? What about this ?\nPhD C:Uh , y you had something on it . Right ?\nPhD E:Just the frame - dropping problem . Yeah . But it 's {disfmarker} it 's difficult . Sometime we {disfmarker} we change two {disfmarker} two things together and {disfmarker} But it 's around {pause} maybe {disfmarker} it 's less than one percent .\nProfessor B:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD E:It {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Well . {vocalsound} But like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then {vocalsound} pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement .\nPhD E:Yeah . Yeah . And it {disfmarker} Yeah . And then we have to be careful with that also {disfmarker} with the neural net\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD E:because in {comment} the proposal the neural net was also , uh , working on {disfmarker} after frame - dropping .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:Um .\nProfessor B:Oh , that 's a real good point .\nPhD E:So . Well , we 'll have to be {disfmarker} to do the same kind of correction .\nProfessor B:It might be hard if it 's at the server side . Right ?\nPhD E:Mmm . Well , we can do the frame - dropping on the server side or we can just be careful at the terminal side to send a couple of more frames before and after , and {disfmarker} So . I think it 's OK .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD A:You have , um {disfmarker} So when you {disfmarker} Uh , maybe I don't quite understand how this works , but , um , couldn't you just send all of the frames , but mark the ones that are supposed to be dropped ? Cuz you have a bunch more bandwidth . Right ?\nProfessor B:Well , you could . Yeah . I mean , it {disfmarker} it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to {disfmarker} in addition to , uh , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth .\nPhD A:Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B:But nobody seems to have {vocalsound} cared about that in this {pause} evaluation .\nPhD A:And that way the net could use {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:So .\nPhD A:If the net 's on the server side then it could use all of the {pause} frames .\nPhD C:Yes , it could be . It 's , like , you mean you just transferred everything and then finally drop the frames after the neural net .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:Right ? Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} that 's one thing which {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:But you could even mark them , before they get to the server .\nPhD C:Yeah . Right now we are {disfmarker} Uh , ri Right now what {disfmarker} wha what we did is , like , we just mark {disfmarker} we just have this additional bit which goes around the features , {vocalsound} saying it 's currently a {disfmarker} it 's a speech or a nonspeech .\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nPhD C:So there is no frame - dropping till the final features , like , including the deltas are computed .\nPhD A:I see .\nPhD C:And after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . I see . I see .\nProfessor B:So it would be more or less the same thing with the neural net , I guess , actually .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:So . Yeah , that 's what {disfmarker} that 's what {disfmarker} that 's what , uh , this is doing right now .\nPhD A:I see . OK .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Um . OK . So , uh , what 's , uh {disfmarker} ? That 's {disfmarker} that 's a good set of work that {disfmarker} that , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Just one more thing . Like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation , because we still {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B:Yeah . I was wondering about that . That was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I had written that down there .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Um {disfmarker}\nPhD E:So , we , uh {disfmarker} actually I did the first experiment . This is {pause} with just fifteen frames . Um . We take the first fifteen frame of each utterance to it ,\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD E:and average their power spectra . Um . I tried just plugging the , um , {vocalsound} uh , Guenter noise estimation on this system , and it {disfmarker} uh , it got worse . Um , but of course I didn't play {pause} with it .\nProfessor B:Uh - huh .\nPhD E:But {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Uh , I didn't {pause} do much more {pause} for noise estimation . I just tried this ,\nProfessor B:Hmm . Yeah . Well , it 's not surprising it 'd be worse the first time .\nPhD E:and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:But , um ,\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:it does seem like , you know , i i i i some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and a a always depending on a {disfmarker} a pause is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is a good idea . Uh , maybe you have to weight the estimate from the first - teen {disfmarker} fifteen frames more heavily than {disfmarker} than was done in your first attempt . But {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:but {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Yeah , I guess .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Um . No , I mean {disfmarker} Um , do you have any way of assessing how well or how poorly the noise estimation is currently doing ?\nPhD E:Mmm . No , we don't .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD E:We don't have nothing {pause} that {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Is there {disfmarker} was there any experiment with {disfmarker} ? Well , I {disfmarker} I did {disfmarker} The only experiment where I tried was I used the channel zero VAD for the noise estimation and frame - dropping . So I don't have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't have a split , like which one helped more .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nPhD C:So . It {disfmarker} it was the best result I could get .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:So , that 's the {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:So that 's something you could do with , um , this final system . Right ? Just do this {disfmarker} everything that is in this final system except , {vocalsound} uh , use the channel zero .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm . For the noise estimation .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD C:Yeah . We can try something .\nProfessor B:And then see how much better it gets .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm . Sure .\nProfessor B:If it 's , you know , essentially not better , then {pause} it 's probably not worth\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor B:any more .\nPhD C:Yeah . But the Guenter 's argument is slightly different . It 's , like , ev even {disfmarker} even if I use a channel zero VAD , I 'm just averaging the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the s power spectrum . But the Guenter 's argument is , like , if it is a non - stationary {pause} segment , then he doesn't update the noise spectrum . So he 's , like {disfmarker} he tries to capture only the stationary part in it . So the averaging is , like , {vocalsound} different from {pause} updating the noise spectrum only during stationary segments . So , th the Guenter was arguing that , I mean , even if you have a very good VAD , averaging it , like , over the whole thing is not a good idea .\nProfessor B:I see .\nPhD C:Because you 're averaging the stationary and the non - stationary , and finally you end up getting something which is not really the s because , you {disfmarker} anyway , you can't remove the stationary part fr I mean , non - stationary part from {vocalsound} the signal .\nProfessor B:Not using these methods anyway . Yeah .\nPhD C:So {disfmarker} Yeah . So you just {pause} update only doing {disfmarker} or update only the stationary components . Yeah . So , that 's {disfmarker} so that 's still a slight difference from what Guenter is trying \nProfessor B:Well , yeah . And {disfmarker} and also there 's just the fact that , um , eh , uh , although we 're trying to do very well on this evaluation , um , we actually would like to have something that worked well in general . And , um , relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is {disfmarker} is pretty {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor B:I mean , you might , you might not .\nPhD C:Mmm .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:So , um . Um , it 'd certainly be more robust to different kinds of input if you had at least some updates . Um .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:But , um . Well , I don't know . What {disfmarker} what do you , uh {disfmarker} what do you guys see as {disfmarker} as being what you would be doing in the next week , given wha what 's {pause} happened ?\nPhD C:Cure the VAD ?\nPhD E:Yeah .\nPhD A:What was that ?\nPhD C:VAD .\nPhD A:Oh .\nPhD C:And {disfmarker} \nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD E:So , should we keep the same {disfmarker} ? I think we might try to keep the same idea of having a neural network , but {vocalsound} training it on more data and adding better features , I think , but {disfmarker} because the current network is just PLP features . Well , it 's trained on noisy {pause} PLP {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Just the cepstra . Yeah .\nPhD E:PLP features computed on noisy speech . But {vocalsound} {vocalsound} there is no nothing particularly robust in these features .\nPhD A:So , I I uh {disfmarker}\nPhD C:No .\nPhD E:There 's no RASTA , no {disfmarker}\nPhD A:So , uh , I {disfmarker} I don't remember what you said {vocalsound} the answer to my , uh , question earlier . Will you {disfmarker} will you train the net on {disfmarker} after you 've done the spectral subtraction or the Wiener filtering ?\nProfessor B:This is a different net .\nPhD A:Oh .\nPhD C:So we have a VAD which is like neur that 's a neural net .\nPhD E:Oh , yeah . Hmm .\nPhD A:Oh , you 're talking about the VAD net . OK .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:I see .\nPhD C:So that {disfmarker} that VAD was trained on the noisy features .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:So , right now we have , like , uh {disfmarker} we have the cleaned - up features , so we can have a better VAD by training the net on {pause} the cleaned - up speech .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . I see . I see .\nPhD C:Yeah , but we need a VAD for uh noise estimation also . So it 's , like , where do we want to put the VAD ? Uh , it 's like {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Can you use the same net to do both , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD C:For {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Can you use the same net that you {disfmarker} that I was talking about to do the VAD ?\nPhD C:Mm - hmm . Uh , it actually comes at v at the very end .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:So the net {disfmarker} the final net {disfmarker} I mean , which is the feature net {disfmarker} so that actually comes after a chain of , like , LDA plus everything . So it 's , like , it takes a long time to get a decision out of it . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and you can actually do it for final frame - dropping , but not for the VA - f noise estimation .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:You see , the idea is that the , um , initial decision to {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that you 're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly .\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nPhD C:Hmm .\nPhD A:Cuz that 's used by some of these other {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B:And that {disfmarker} Yeah . And that 's sort of fed forward , and {disfmarker} and you say \" well , flush everything , it 's not speech anymore \" .\nPhD A:Oh , OK . I see .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD A:I thought that was only used for doing frame - dropping later on .\nProfessor B:Um , it is used , uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's only used f Well , it 's used for frame - dropping . Um , it 's used for end of utterance\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor B:because , you know , there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you have {pause} more than five hundred milliseconds of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of nonspeech then you figure it 's end of utterance or something like that .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:So , um .\nPhD E:And it seems important for , like , the on - line normalization . Um . We don't want to update the mean and variance during silen long silence portions . Um . So it {disfmarker} it has to be done before\nPhD A:Oh . I see .\nPhD E:this mean and variance normalization . Um .\nProfessor B:Um . Yeah . So probably the VAD and {disfmarker} and maybe testing out the noise {pause} estimation a little bit . I mean , keeping the same method but {disfmarker} but , uh , {vocalsound} seeing if you cou but , um noise estimation could be improved . Those are sort of related issues .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:It probably makes sense to move from there . And then , uh , {vocalsound} later on in the month I think we wanna start including the {pause} neural net at the end . Um . OK . Anything else ?\nPhD E:The Half Dome was great .\nProfessor B:Good . Yeah . You didn't {disfmarker} didn't fall . That 's good .\nPhD C:Well , yeah .\nProfessor B:Our e our effort would have been devastated if you guys had {comment} {vocalsound} run into problems .\nPhD A:So , Hynek is coming back next week , you said ?\nProfessor B:Yeah , that 's the plan .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nProfessor B:I guess the week after he 'll be , uh , going back to Europe , and so we wanna {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Is he in Europe right now or is he up at {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B:No , no . He 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's dropped into the US . Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A:Oh . Hmm .\nProfessor B:So . Uh . {vocalsound} So , uh . Uh , the idea was that , uh , we 'd {disfmarker} we 'd sort out where we were going next with this {disfmarker} with this work before he , uh , left on this next trip . Good . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh , Barry , you just got through your {vocalsound} quals , so I don't know if you {vocalsound} have much to say . But , uh .\nGrad D:Mmm . No , just , uh , looking into some {disfmarker} some of the things that , um , {vocalsound} uh , John Ohala and Hynek , um , gave as feedback , um , as {disfmarker} as a starting point for the project . Um . In {disfmarker} in my proposal , I {disfmarker} I was thinking about starting from a set of , uh , phonological features , {vocalsound} or a subset of them . Um , but that might not be necessarily a good idea according to , um , John .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:He said , uh , um , these {disfmarker} these phonological features are {disfmarker} are sort of figments of imagination also .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:Um . S\nProfessor B:In conversational speech in particular . I think you can {disfmarker} you can put them in pretty reliably in synthetic speech .\nGrad D:Ye\nProfessor B:But {vocalsound} we don't have too much trouble recognizing synthetic speech since we create it in the first place . So , it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Right . Yeah . So , um , a better way would be something more {disfmarker} more data - driven ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:just looking at the data and seeing what 's similar and what 's not similar .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:So , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm , um , taking a look at some of , um , {vocalsound} Sangita 's work on {disfmarker} on TRAPS . She did something where , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} w where the TRAPS learn She clustered the {disfmarker} the temporal patterns of , um , certain {disfmarker} certain phonemes in {disfmarker} in m averaged over many , many contexts . And , uh , some things tended to cluster .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:Right ? You know , like stop {disfmarker} stop consonants clustered really well .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nGrad D:Um , silence was by its own self .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:And , uh , um , {vocalsound} v vocalic was clustered .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:And , {vocalsound} um , so , {vocalsound} those are {pause} interesting things to {disfmarker}\nPhD A:So you 're {disfmarker} now you 're sort of looking to try to gather a set of these types of features ?\nGrad D:Right .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:Yeah . Just to see where {disfmarker} where I could start off from ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:uh , you know ? A {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a set of small features and continue to iterate and find , uh , a better set .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:OK . Well , short meeting . That 's OK .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:OK . So next week hopefully we 'll {disfmarker} can get Hynek here to {disfmarker} to join us and , uh , uh .\nPhD A:Should we do digits ?\nProfessor B:Digits , digits . OK , now .\nPhD A:Go ahead , Morgan . You can start .\nProfessor B:Alright . Let me get my glasses on so I can {pause} see them . OK .\nPhD A:OK . And we 're off .\nProfessor B:Mm\n",
        "summary": "The group discussed the current state of their work, which was coming close to a conclusion. They were putting together their final model, including the various techniques they had explored. Their performance on the Aurora tasks was second and very close to those in first place. The professor thought that further tweaking and incorporation of a neural network would improve their scores. The team discussed which method to use for noise suppression, which had not been decided yet. They also delved into a more detailed discussion of the VAD and latency. Their method for noise estimation would add a notable delay to the model. Finally, the team delved further into how to finish up the model.",

Um the agenda for this meeting {vocalsound} is um {disfmarker} we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:And um {disfmarker} So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you . Do you want to present it ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , here we are .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} This is what we came up with . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . And {vocalsound} we {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:On ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Mango shape .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} A mango . Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here\nIndustrial Designer:The L_E_D_ .\nUser Interface:and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh . Okay .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:I'm sorry .\nProject Manager:Oops .\nMarketing:What was the {disfmarker} where's the L_E_D_ ?\nUser Interface:It's in the middle of one of the little R_s .\nMarketing:Oh . Okay .\nUser Interface:And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be\nIndustrial Designer:So it's palm-held .\nUser Interface:accessible from your thumb\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} yeah palm-held\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb .\nProject Manager:Notice you have a number ten button .\nUser Interface:So you don't have to {disfmarker} Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You just need the nought . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Right no , that's a zero .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Take that one off . {vocalsound} Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No problem .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Ah .\nUser Interface:And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus .\nIndustrial Designer:So one plus one would be eleven ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} You can go one , three or something .\nIndustrial Designer:or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh . You press a plus button ?\nUser Interface:You press that first and then you go one three yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before .\nUser Interface:Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah because if you {disfmarker} on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to {disfmarker} um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Oh , there's no e\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .\nUser Interface:So the plus and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing:okay .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:I\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker} Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?\nUser Interface:No no , th all {disfmarker} that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine .\nProject Manager:Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?\nMarketing:Sixty .\nUser Interface:You p Oh . No you press the plus first .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nUser Interface:I I {disfmarker} well it doesn't {disfmarker} we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but she says plus {disfmarker} {vocalsound} press {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I don't mind , we can further define that .\nUser Interface:what do you think is simpler ?\nProject Manager:I th Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering\nIndustrial Designer:But I suppose it's not as snappy .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .\nMarketing:Well the there is a {disfmarker} there's a delay on remotes I think .\nUser Interface:Oops . Yeah .\nMarketing:Where you can have it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:it's like a five second input time .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . If you don't put it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So as long as you hit them dada\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} it should be fine .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Was there {disfmarker} so on the top there is volume and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And channel ,\nUser Interface:A channel .\nIndustrial Designer:which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Channel up volume up . Okay cool .\nProject Manager:C_ and V_ .\nUser Interface:Just so we can flick {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right , where um where's the power button ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's the bigger R_ .\nMarketing:It's the R_ .\nProject Manager:Oh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's just like {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote .\nIndustrial Designer:We deci\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .\nProject Manager:Oh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh e ergonomics are all considered .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic .\nUser Interface:And {vocalsound} it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The spon yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and it just feels feels different .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Bit of a stress ball feel .\nIndustrial Designer:Would you like to feel it yourselves ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . I would .\nIndustrial Designer:How it fits in the palm of your hand ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:My goodness .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Thanks .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} There you go .\nIndustrial Designer:And you ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Genevieve ?\nMarketing:Yes\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:.

Oh god . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype .\nUser Interface:Of Play Doh yeah .\nMarketing:Oh it smells good . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination . Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green ,\nProject Manager:Oh right .\nIndustrial Designer:or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in\nUser Interface:'Cause it'd be quite subtle and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It looks more {disfmarker} Think like vanilla and banana would .\nIndustrial Designer:Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company {disfmarker} the yellow and black .\nProject Manager:Okay yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So that {disfmarker} for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Kinda Christmas , you know .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , seasonal .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of ,\nProject Manager:Cool .\nUser Interface:and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated {vocalsound} customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it .\nProject Manager:Alright , thank you very much .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Good work everyone .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Bravo {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So , I have something I'm going to {disfmarker} Oh wait a minute .\nMarketing:You want the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you need to do a presentation first ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I don't know what order it goes in .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second .\nMarketing:I have one .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm go {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What time is it anyw\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line .\nMarketing:Evaluation cri Okay . That's me .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Hello . Oh there we go . Okay . Come on my computer . Come on . {vocalsound} Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties .\nProject Manager:Just press um function eight again .\nMarketing:Should I press it again ? Last time I did that it sh Okay . You're right .\nProject Manager:And then again I think . One more time .\nMarketing:Oh . Still not there .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay now I think for this one I could {disfmarker} Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on {disfmarker} right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . Um and looking looking back at my notes from our {disfmarker} both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . {vocalsound} Okay so question number one . Does the remote {disfmarker} whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able {disfmarker} um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:I'll write down our scores up on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ooh .\nMarketing:Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?\nIndustrial Designer:Feel I think .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:We've been quite successful with the rubber coating\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The look is a little bit more playful .\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different .\nProject Manager:Oh definitely different yeah .\nMarketing:It's not your traditional {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean {vocalsound} th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not the kind of {disfmarker} ooh uh at all sleek\nProject Manager:Oh you were only given red and black ?\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} red , black and yellow , and orange .\nProject Manager:Oh okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound} so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But if you can imagine that in like a s just a {disfmarker} maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well I know know it's for rubber .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Polished . Okay {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . I kinda {disfmarker} I like the potato look .\nProject Manager:It's mango . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We we were {vocalsound} we were thinking about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's very different . It's what ?\nProject Manager:It's mango . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh sorry the mango the mango look .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Potato's fine . Potato's fine .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable .\nMarketing:So I myself would say a one or a two .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I would say two . Personally .\nUser Interface:I w I'd say two I think .\nMarketing:It's a two ?\nIndustrial Designer:For the\nMarketing:Okay ,\nUser Interface:Fanciness .\nMarketing:and p\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:fancy {disfmarker}\nMarketing:One being true . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker} uh two , three . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Two .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was {vocalsound} is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and the use of the rubber .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:For the anti-R_S_I_ .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative\nMarketing:Isn't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:In some aspects it is , like we said .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I'd say maybe three .\nUser Interface:I'll go for three as well .\nMarketing:Yeah . And I think {disfmarker} I mean it it's tough to say because we were {disfmarker} we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose .\nProject Manager:Yeah we want it simple .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Though it was our specification .\nUser Interface:No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah .\nMarketing:So I mean I {disfmarker} we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ?\nProject Manager:I think so . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah very .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think one for that .\nMarketing:Yeah . S Yeah\nProject Manager:Yeah . One .\nMarketing:I think it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:you can't really get confused with that .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:Th\nMarketing:I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number {disfmarker} the plus system .\nProject Manager:The plus number thing .\nUser Interface:Yeah that's the only thing yeah .\nMarketing:But once that's figured out , it should be fine .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and perhaps the turning on but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's definitely {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Again I think the colour comes into this .\nProject Manager:Yeah colour will definitely be a factor .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:I think that the logo could be smaller .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:And maybe not such a prominent way .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe like at the bottom , kind of .\nUser Interface:But the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Not in {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .\nProject Manager:Oh it just had to be on there I guess .\nMarketing:Whoops .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Should just not touch it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Don't worry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} This time it's the three I killed . {vocalsound} I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . Or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I suppose I've got quite big hands .\nProject Manager:I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But you know what I've just thought of there now . What {disfmarker} where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ?\nProject Manager:Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like\nMarketing:Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:round .\nUser Interface:But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Oh . That's true .\nProject Manager:It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe , it could {disfmarker} it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Like that .\nUser Interface:Oh that would be nice . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I g If it's weighted maybe .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay we're done designing .\nIndustrial Designer:H it's got higher centre of gravity like that .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Details , details . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Come on .\nMarketing:Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? {vocalsound} Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit {disfmarker} it's more interesting than other remotes .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think , it was another colour and it was like {disfmarker} I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that ,\nMarketing:I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours .\nMarketing:Okay , so should we say two for that ?\nProject Manager:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um {disfmarker} will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy .\nUser Interface:I think we have to market it in the right way , that um {disfmarker} to say that it is simplistic .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:We have to market it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah it {disfmarker} the marketing will have a lot to do with it .\nIndustrial Designer:And {vocalsound} the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo ,\nUser Interface:And the kinetic energy part . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} Durable . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:ooh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Shake it and the buttons fall off . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} But you know , those'll be firmly on .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Don't shake {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh no the plus . {vocalsound} You're\nMarketing:No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for ,\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} use the zero .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Make a new one .\nProject Manager:But you're our Marketing Expert . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:but {disfmarker} I know I am , aren't I ?\nUser Interface:I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ?\nMarketing:But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , yeah , that's true .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh . Exactly . Exactly .\nMarketing:So we'll market it that way too .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Good point .\nMarketing:So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . I would give it a two still though .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .\nMarketing:Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think it does very well .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Because {disfmarker}\nMarketing:we said {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing .\nUser Interface:The zap {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it's just {disfmarker} you won't have to think about it .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:You don't have to look down to find them .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:They're clearly there , easy to use .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Simple .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:But they're not you and I really .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So . Okay so one ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly .\nProject Manager:We have the alarm system .\nMarketing:Now is there the {disfmarker} is the alarm system still {disfmarker} was it implemented ?\nUser Interface:Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the {vocalsound} lights {vocalsound} behind the {disfmarker} and it'll vibra {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It {disfmarker} Yeah\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm .\nUser Interface:It'll be again in the marketing .\nProject Manager:I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .\nUser Interface:Yeah . The light {disfmarker} it will .\nProject Manager:Or or was it gonna make a noise ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . But when the alarm's not {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . If you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But both {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You press the button it makes a noise right ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It turns into a duck and starts quacking .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You could s {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Awesome . Awesome .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh , that would be brilliant .\nMarketing:Here I am .\nUser Interface:I'd be tempted to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well the thing is , if it was {disfmarker} had an alarm system ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up .\nUser Interface:It would have to be in the market\nProject Manager:I though w it was gonna make a noise .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Alarm ,\nUser Interface:Yeah but you still couldn't see it .\nIndustrial Designer:but you can't see an alarm inside uh {disfmarker} the alarm system itself .\nUser Interface:It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:We {disfmarker} oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah .\nMarketing:But yeah , it'll be there .\nProject Manager:Oh okay .\nMarketing:So we can {disfmarker} we could say that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Whoo . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find .\nProject Manager:Yeah , totally .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sorry Heather .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No problem , mm .\nIndustrial Designer:That wasn't very clear .\nMarketing:Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult .\nProject Manager:Totally .\nMarketing:So it has to be {disfmarker} yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do .\nUser Interface:So the plu the plus {disfmarker} w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple ,\nMarketing:The plus thing needs to be worked on .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nUser Interface:won't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:just because it's {disfmarker} we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use .\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Do {disfmarker} Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an {disfmarker} just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter .\nUser Interface:That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah but you don't have to press zeros .\nUser Interface:I don't know why . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:You could just press six enter ,\nUser Interface:Oh okay . Right .\nProject Manager:And then like twelve , enter .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker} or sixty six enter , y\nMarketing:or one two enter .\nUser Interface:Alright , aye .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , okay so we can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I'd say w yeah one .\nMarketing:we'll say yes it's uh one ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh . Mm .\nMarketing:Question number nine .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nMarketing:Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ?\nIndustrial Designer:Injury .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , which affected over a quarter of users .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Hmm .\nMarketing:S\nProject Manager:I think so . It's like right in the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But if you're zapping {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Your thumb might get a little bit uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's what I was thinking .\nUser Interface:yeah . I don't think it will f\nIndustrial Designer:We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:the biology .\nProject Manager:But it is soft .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:It's soft ,\nProject Manager:And that's kind of what the um\nMarketing:and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ ,\nMarketing:And people could {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker} maybe it is but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't know what other options there are .\nIndustrial Designer:I think we're getting {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that's true .\nMarketing:Could {disfmarker} I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So , one or two do you think ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I I'd say t\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , I think too .\nUser Interface:two . Yeah\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Two okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ?\nProject Manager:Yes we did .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} N We we can't really do that\nMarketing:Is the yellow {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It won't stand out .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So n it's not always gonna be the same colour .\nMarketing:It sounds like the colour's something that we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Gray , yeah .\nProject Manager:So it could be grey on the banana one .\nUser Interface:Yeah , could be grey .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though ,\nUser Interface:Yeah that's right ,\nMarketing:depending on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:we didn't even rea\nMarketing:So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah . I think this is the\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Perhaps a metallic\nProject Manager:Mm , yeah .\nUser Interface:or or {disfmarker} like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:That isn't rubber .\nMarketing:And the buttons in the middle .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ?\nIndustrial Designer:Four I think . Well I don't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Four ?\nIndustrial Designer:what do {disfmarker} what {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hum .\nMarketing:Well we have good reasons for it , so we {disfmarker} but we can still put a a four ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , and final question . {vocalsound} Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I would say so .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Following that briefing we did .\nProject Manager:But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:With the with the colours .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like um the colour scheme names and stuff .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think I missed a few {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:they are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:okay . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:It is .\nUser Interface:I think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief .\nIndustrial Designer:The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango .\nUser Interface:Well we haven't got a big banana but {disfmarker} Oh yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Be like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe if it was scented .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh that would be class . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah . There we go . That would be great .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah we have money for that . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yes we do . So I {disfmarker} wh what was I gonna put for that ?\nProject Manager:Oh .\nMarketing:A two for fashion ?\nProject Manager:I would say two .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Two .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven\nProject Manager:One point nine or something ?\nUser Interface:It's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I don't know these things . Um , between one and two .\nIndustrial Designer:Between one and two .\nMarketing:Between {disfmarker} okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's pretty fantastic .\nUser Interface:Close to two .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:I got {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Does that seem right then ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh , aye .\nIndustrial Designer:It seems like it should be more around two .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Uh , should've added five .\nIndustrial Designer:Do we have an online calculator ?\nProject Manager:I'm attempting to do that {vocalsound} right now .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} This is {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh wow . Well done .\nUser Interface:Yay .\nProject Manager:Go Heather Pauls .\nIndustrial Designer:Well that's excellent .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . And um my computer's frozen . And now it's not . Okay . So um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um I'm going to um steal a cable .\nMarketing:Sorry . Are you gonna do that ? Okay .\nProject Manager:Um it's it's um\nUser Interface:Is that the project document ?\nProject Manager:it's an Excel file . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Production costs .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay there we go . Um , production costs . And um I have to access that as well . One moment . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It says it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:'Kay so far I've added what I think {disfmarker} or what is going on ? Great . It's blinking at me . It's locked for editing . Read only . I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . I have the original in my um my email account .\nMarketing:Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ?\nProject Manager:I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now .\nMarketing:Or {disfmarker} okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Have you have you completed it ?\nProject Manager:No . No , I was hoping that you guys could .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right . Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:Um , there we go .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um we're using a regular chip .\nUser Interface:Oh right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around .\nIndustrial Designer:Double double-curved yeah .\nProject Manager:That's another three . We're already at five . Um , we're using plastic and rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker} Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . Um {disfmarker} S\nUser Interface:What about a special colour ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Are we using that ?\nProject Manager:I guess we should do it just for one kind . So it's like special colour {disfmarker} well we'll have two colours\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:right ? Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . And a special material .\nUser Interface:And a special material . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Which puts us just barely under budget .\nIndustrial Designer:Oof .\nProject Manager:Hurray .\nIndustrial Designer:Congratulations guys .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Good work guys .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . 'S good . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros .\nUser Interface:That's good .\nProject Manager:Awesome . And back to our PowerPoint . So we've {disfmarker} 'Kay . Yes we are . So we need to do a product evaluation , again ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:which is probably um {disfmarker} I dunno . A different extension of a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Of the actual project rather than the product ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:A project ? Is is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Alright so um {disfmarker} Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think we were pushed .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Pushed for creativity ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task .\nUser Interface:The ma Or materials . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So I think we could've done with a bit more time .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Ye Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So it'd be like need more time and materials . But you were allowed m creativity ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think so as like {disfmarker} but you were supposed to have creativ\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that .\nMarketing:When we can down to it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So that did limit creativity .\nUser Interface:Creativity .\nProject Manager:Right\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Just resources .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay\nIndustrial Designer:But yeah . The fruit and veg idea . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Great .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Leadership ? Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? Um . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Good leadership , I think we stayed on task .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah we did . We've , uh {disfmarker} seeing as we've come out with what we intended . A pro um a product within the budget . I think that's a sign of good leadership\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and also our personal coach helped us along the way ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so you know {disfmarker} I think it's been fine .\nMarketing:And the timing was good . We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Good timing .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oop {gap} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Teamwork ?\nIndustrial Designer:And project manager of course .\nProject Manager:I think we worked great as a team . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Was good teamwork . I think we are well-suited to our roles .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright how were our means ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We needed more Play Doh colours .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and more Play Doh ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'cause that was all the red we had .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it c it might've been bigger . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh really ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But ever everything else was satisfactory ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Is that good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . The computer programmes are good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . It could be really straightforward for the computer .\nMarketing:The {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays\nMarketing:Yeah . I don't think there was anything {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Uh me too .\nMarketing:They'll probably still be there .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:New ideas found . I don't really know what that means .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other ,\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:like the n um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Through discussion .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Just about each different {gap} . Got new ideas from each other . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'm not sure , new ideas found .\nProject Manager:Hmm ?\nMarketing:Yeah well I guess we really {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} we bounced off of each other , which was cool .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah , worked well .\nUser Interface:And we were a able to modify each other's ideas\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:to fit in with our areas of expertise . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Each other's {gap}\nMarketing:Oh does it have smart materials by the way ?\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry ?\nMarketing:Does it have smart materials ?\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well mm , did it come into the into {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:If if it if it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno if we counted that in the costs . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:If it can be afforded .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay ? Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes our costs are within budget . It's evaluated generally positively .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Then we celebrate\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . Fantastic .\nUser Interface:Yay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} By watching T_V_ ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:in such a way that I have no idea .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , brilliant .\nProject Manager:Alright ?\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you very much . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , bye . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Conclusion ? Dadada .\n",
        "summary": "Firstly, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and innovative functions like the plus button. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of both the conceptual as well as functional meetings and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals. Thirdly, the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that the most expensive part was the use of kinetic. But the team decided to use regular chips and cheap materials, which made the budget under control. Lastly, the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process.",

You ready back there ? {vocalsound} Uh okay . Welcome everyone . Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . Okay . The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . The originality um is gonna take all of us . Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at {disfmarker} for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . Um and we'll get on with it . Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . Okay ? Right . Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on .\nProject Manager:And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh I do not think so ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Are we all gonna draw a cat ?\nProject Manager:I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Only animal I could thin I could draw {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:I know .\nIndustrial Designer:Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , yeah .\nProject Manager:Great . And the characteristics ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um {disfmarker} the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:In fact , I'll give it some more {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh , and the tail\nProject Manager:Fantastic . Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph . I think it's to get us used to using the pen .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yes . Um sure it's not to test our artistic {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh no . {vocalsound} A mouse-y ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's a mouse .\nUser Interface:That's not a mouse-y , no .\nIndustrial Designer:No it's not a mouse . It's a wombat .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:It's a ratty .\nProject Manager:Argh .\nIndustrial Designer:A what ?\nProject Manager:Rat .\nUser Interface:A ratty .\nProject Manager:Not a mouse , a rat .\nIndustrial Designer:A webbed foot . Webbed f {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's clothes . That's it's clothes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail .\nProject Manager:And your favourite characteristics of that animal .\nUser Interface:I love whiskers . Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky {vocalsound} and uh fantastic pets\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:and very friendly .\nProject Manager:Okay . Kate ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thanks .\nProject Manager:Oh , a fish .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Gosh ,\nUser Interface:A shark ?\nIndustrial Designer:why didn't I think of fish ? That's even easier to draw than cat . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm {vocalsound} this is very representational fish . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Fine .\nMarketing:Um I like them because they're sleek\nProject Manager:Favourite characteristics ?\nMarketing:and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups ,\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:so .\nProject Manager:So they have team elements . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Do you have a favourite one ?\nProject Manager:I'm afraid I'm with Steph . And I think your pen's running out of whatever . But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:He's hiding .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um cats are sometimes very independent . My parents had cats . Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . Okay . Now um {vocalsound} we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold {disfmarker} um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh {disfmarker} can you do the maths and how many are we selling ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh yeah . {vocalsound} I was just wondering if that's the um {disfmarker} If fifty percent is normal {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mark-up ?\nMarketing:B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . But um let me {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:I have two thoughts . One hundred , fifty percent .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:And and your question is how many do we have to sell ?\nProject Manager:Yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is {disfmarker} has to do with marketing of {disfmarker} you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that .\nMarketing:At twenty five . Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking .\nMarketing:So that's four million of them ?\nProject Manager:Something like that ? Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's fifty million Euros . In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And if we make {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That's a lot of selling . Two four {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Four million .\nProject Manager:To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay ? Right . Experience with a remote control . Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? You're both nodding ,\nIndustrial Designer:That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a {disfmarker} in a home environment , for a T_V_s and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:all three . Well I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another .\nUser Interface:It is true that you always sit around {disfmarker} you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Y yeah .\nProject Manager:And they don't always talk to each other .\nUser Interface:But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television .\nProject Manager:Don't know . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Are there any um ideas for the remote ? What would it be for and what group would be be for ? We have to think about that one .\nMarketing:We could make a Hello Kitty\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:themed remote .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think one in b bright colours would be good . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think one that works would be good . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great {vocalsound} products . Electrical {disfmarker} their industrial design is very good .\nUser Interface:I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . Like I've got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , that's a really good point ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:because I think one of the things that {disfmarker} being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus .\nUser Interface:Ooh , closing the meeting .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Um I know this sounds like it was very quick ,\nUser Interface:That was quick .\nProject Manager:but the I think that's the industrial design is the first one ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:that's Kate , for the working design .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . I think there's going to be a lot of {disfmarker} we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , {vocalsound} we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . Do you all agree ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Alright . Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Thank you all .\n",

        "conversations": "Industrial Designer:'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so in that sense {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , sure .\nIndustrial Designer:so it does kind of make sense , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of {vocalsound} talking about action and design as opposed to background .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Everything I have is kinda background .\nProject Manager:Okay we all ready to go ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Well how um on the {disfmarker} in this meeting then if we um {disfmarker} I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . And we uh decided on\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um {vocalsound} . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . Um so that was the last meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Is there anything {disfmarker} have I forgotten anything ?\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:Is that everything ?\nMarketing:Uh that sounds {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of {disfmarker} that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . That might be a better idea this time .\nMarketing:Sure .\nProject Manager:And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:if that's alright .\nMarketing:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah , cool .\nProject Manager:So if you wanna take this .\nMarketing:Why don't I get that {vocalsound} ? Hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Screwed in quite tightly . Uh what did {disfmarker} uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? We {disfmarker} did we say we were gonna try {disfmarker} maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Right . Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So um {vocalsound} that's kind of the end result hopefully .\nMarketing:Okay . Um alright so c is it function F_ eight ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh-huh . Hopefully appear in a wee second .\nMarketing:Hmm . Come on . I think it's working .\nProject Manager:Up there we go .\nMarketing:Okay great s so let me just start this . {vocalsound} Okay great . So um {vocalsound} uh s move on . Uh-huh {disfmarker} oh where'd it all go ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh no .\nMarketing:It's not good . Okay lemme just see where I can find it . This looks more like it . I think I just opened up the template .\nProject Manager:Oh right .\nMarketing:Sorry about that . Okay alright so let's have a look here .\nProject Manager:Here we go .\nMarketing:Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see {disfmarker} sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this .\nProject Manager:Aye a fair point definitely .\nMarketing:Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Number two was that it be innovative . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um {vocalsound} quite user friendly while still having technology . So it {disfmarker} I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um {vocalsound} what we should think about is how the um {vocalsound} about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Aye right .\nMarketing:For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:because obviously the thing that {disfmarker} the message here is ease of use . So how do you make innovation make something more {vocalsound} more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . Uh top European fashion trend um {vocalsound} that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it ,\nProject Manager:Okay okay .\nMarketing:do you know what I mean ? So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um {vocalsound} so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think that would be pushing it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is {disfmarker} which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . Um {disfmarker} So these this is the summary of everything . Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen {disfmarker} it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . That was like the number three thing . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons .\nProject Manager:Mm that's true , yeah .\nMarketing:You know what a Mac iPod is ? I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of {disfmarker} or more of like a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um {vocalsound} techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a {disfmarker} I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . Um {disfmarker} Does that make sense ? Yeah . So {vocalsound} so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their {disfmarker} what people associate this {disfmarker} them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay . Great .\nMarketing:Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So anyway it's just just an idea .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} into something which is {disfmarker} which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up .\nProject Manager:Ah .\nMarketing:How can we build on that ? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Anyway those are {disfmarker} that's all I have ,\nProject Manager:That's great .\nMarketing:but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . Okay great .\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:Um thank you for that . Uh Craig do you wanna\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:uh plug yours in then ?\nUser Interface:Is it working ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm . Not quite .\nMarketing:Did you press F_ eight ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's probably not sending . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh something coming now , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yep , there it is .\nProject Manager:There we go .\nUser Interface:And so think of this concept . Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um {disfmarker} So then this {disfmarker} we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . Um they're not very attractive to look at , {vocalsound} and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're {disfmarker} I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . Um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , uh it really should be . It's uh something the user then uh identify with . This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control {vocalsound} um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The buttons should be large . They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . They should be easy to press , very comfortable . {vocalsound} Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um {vocalsound} there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . Um should avoid s things like that . Um {vocalsound} if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think it's yellow\nMarketing:I didn't know .\nProject Manager:because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And the Play-Doh 's yellow {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Fantastic . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but keep going\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:and we'll discuss it after .\nUser Interface:Um\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um if we did decide to go for voice activation {vocalsound} there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} we should definitely avoid the big square block look . That's just wrong .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department , {vocalsound} and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take\nProject Manager:Aye that's a good idea , yeah .\nUser Interface:and {gap} possibility . Right and these are problems I've had with it . Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . I think it's um , fashion into electronics .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nUser Interface:That's it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Great . {vocalsound} Lots of good information there .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah that that was very good ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay um .\nProject Manager:and uh now with David .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think I'm cool .\nMarketing:It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle {gap} {vocalsound} of the table ,\nProject Manager:I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:huh ? Just um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oops .\nProject Manager:Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah okay . Let me just get this going first .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah there it is . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It takes a second , doesn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay , that should be it . Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . Um the components are exactly the same .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . And the power is basically a factor of that . Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said {disfmarker} we've defined , like we only want the basic things that {disfmarker} to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . So um you know it's just a matter of working out space .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . So just go through it in the components . Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe if you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:well I could see the other email that they sent you , um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements {vocalsound} , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:okay there's an L_C_D_ display ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} um I think these are quite standard things .\nMarketing:They're standard , aren't they ?\nIndustrial Designer:No um they're {disfmarker} well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , um but um\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination .\nProject Manager:We {disfmarker} you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't {disfmarker} I'm not very sure about the titanium .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use ,\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so I think that there is some restriction on um {disfmarker} I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:You know as opposed to two .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost . Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Power consumption should be about the same . Um I think the main impact is complexity ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:um and the other thing is um the power options . Um the first one is a standard battery . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up {vocalsound} you know , a crank {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I'll clear one of these things for you . Just by moving it yeah .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but that that might be something {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:which may not be a great idea in Europe or {vocalsound} any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their {disfmarker} and it's a nice sales gimmick I think .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:it's a shake it {vocalsound} it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . You know\nProject Manager:W yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you know\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:you have {disfmarker} you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes ,\nProject Manager:Uh yeah yeah , I see .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:You know just to {disfmarker} if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:kind of {vocalsound} you know just uh you know um {disfmarker} so . Um okay\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I know what you mean yeah .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:my {disfmarker} from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think um something comfortable to hold , um small and slim\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I guess that's more in the sense of {disfmarker} small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it {disfmarker} um so .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . {vocalsound} Um the case {disfmarker} okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that um ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and\nMarketing:It can't be curved .\nIndustrial Designer:it can't be curved on the wood .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , um especially the titanium\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:So um {vocalsound} mixing them may not be a good idea um yep . That's it .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right can I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh question on {disfmarker} can I ask a question ?\nProject Manager:Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so {disfmarker} but yeah you c ask away .\nMarketing:Okay . Can we uh power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery .\nProject Manager:Why what kind of light do you want {disfmarker} are you thinking of ?\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker} I mean I'm thinking it might be {disfmarker} That {disfmarker} for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . Yeah .\nMarketing:and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive .\nMarketing:Illuminate the buttons . Yeah it glows . Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:and that's what everybody does . Oh where's the volume button in the dark ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing:and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something .\nProject Manager:Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Like a phone , yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay cool .\nMarketing:Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days .\nIndustrial Designer:Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ?\nIndustrial Designer:um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:So you could trigger that to a light ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:as opposed to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Right\nIndustrial Designer:glowingness .\nProject Manager:okay um well {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay , great .\nProject Manager:let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an {gap} decision on the the the concepts of the product .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um I mean what does everybody think about {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Does anybody have any ideas of {disfmarker} about how we can fit all that in together ? I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ?\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} I think we could go for like um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit .\nProject Manager:So maybe {disfmarker} do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand .\nProject Manager:So something quite curvy ? Okay um right okay . Colour-wise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think he made that .\nProject Manager:Whose {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What's that ?\nProject Manager:about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And then obviously the uh the materials {disfmarker} when it {disfmarker} has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? That's all .\nMarketing:Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um {vocalsound} the look and feel .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the {disfmarker} on the um {vocalsound} the colour ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:you said company colour yellow . I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:what {disfmarker} can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:shapes and things .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? Like does marketing have any research on {disfmarker} does it need to be long ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Does it need {disfmarker} with a square thing wha\nProject Manager:Oh you know like in circular in shape or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Choice of material yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like fruit . {vocalsound} I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky .\nProject Manager:'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well {disfmarker} you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones ,\nUser Interface:See I'm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels {disfmarker} it feels kind of warmer to the touch . It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . And then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well I'm {disfmarker} do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No no no not at all .\nProject Manager:no I don't think we do either {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with .\nProject Manager:Okay right well um\nMarketing:Do you know what I mean ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing .\nUser Interface:I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape .\nProject Manager:A snowman shape ?\nUser Interface:Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . That's quite a distinctive shape ,\nMarketing:Right ,\nProject Manager:that would be good\nMarketing:sure .\nProject Manager:wouldn't it . Yeah\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so yeah should we go with that ?\nMarketing:Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you wanna draw it on the board ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Can you like {disfmarker} yeah just t we can visualize it .\nUser Interface:Um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside\nProject Manager:Ooh that'd be good .\nUser Interface:or uh you have volume controls about there .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay . Yep .\nProject Manager:So call it the snowman-shape trademark {vocalsound} . Yeah that's cool . Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white {disfmarker} do you want something {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this {gap} here , had a sorta background yellow ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons .\nProject Manager:Okay cool . Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . Or when you like {disfmarker} or if you turn it off or something {disfmarker} if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere .\nUser Interface:I think that might scare me .\nProject Manager:I d I d any thoughts on that at all ?\nUser Interface:I think that'd probably scare me . You turn it on your control possessed s {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I know . Um unless an a I mean if you {disfmarker} also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? Would we put that on the inside or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Do we need an L_C_D_ display ?\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:What what's the functionality of that ?\nProject Manager:It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but the question is what are we using it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What would it achieve ?\nIndustrial Designer:what would we what would we achieve from it ? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker} L_C_ well I'd {disfmarker} when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it ,\nMarketing:Right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so um it's a bit nuts to get the {gap} Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know .\nProject Manager:Mm oh yeah that's true . Yeah . So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but um it's {disfmarker} what's what what would it tell the user ,\nProject Manager:I think that would make it very complex .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm not real\nIndustrial Designer:We have the option of the speaker as well {disfmarker} the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't know if there is really ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Nah .\nProject Manager:no um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I would say no need for a talk-back . Uh does anybody disagree with that ?\nIndustrial Designer:You could put a game on it {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:No ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Easy {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Okay um right\nMarketing:Mm mm .\nProject Manager:so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ?\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:B um I think the {gap} we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere .\nProject Manager:Okay right um what else do you need to talk about ?\nMarketing:Well i I was just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Where would you physically position the buttons ? Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things .\nMarketing:Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Um maybe you wanna draw onto the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Oh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go . Um energy what {disfmarker} do you think that's suggesting we're {disfmarker} how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power ,\nMarketing:Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:I mean what does anybody think about that ?\nMarketing:Um I've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it ,\nIndustrial Designer:No , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:and watches yeah {disfmarker} Sure , okay , right , okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Support for it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I mean just {disfmarker} it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . I've also known people to have {vocalsound} things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either .\nMarketing:So we should think about {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So you'd have the battery as the kind of {disfmarker} to keep it ticking over idea {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Chip on print , is that {disfmarker} that's an industrial design thing , is it David ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes yes .\nProject Manager:Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small .\nProject Manager:Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of {disfmarker} Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah I think so yeah .\nMarketing:Um just a a lot of the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme {disfmarker} like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that .\nMarketing:Like {disfmarker} Okay so so backlighting , that would be good .\nIndustrial Designer:Or even a clear case . Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable ,\nMarketing:Yeah clear ,\nProject Manager:Aye that would be a good idea .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but in the dark it sort of , it's alive {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Um in in a slight subtle way .\nProject Manager:S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it .\nMarketing:Yeah that'd be really good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse .\nProject Manager:Is that what you mean ?\nIndustrial Designer:You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right .\nMarketing:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:So the power {disfmarker} the battery in that sense ,\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that sort of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sure . Yeah they they emanate a light through it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky .\nProject Manager:Lights .\nMarketing:'Kay . Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:mm-hmm . Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?\nIndustrial Designer:The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ?\nMarketing:Or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ?\nMarketing:Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ?\nProject Manager:If you're holding it in your hand you could {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's a very unnatural motion to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you think ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . Um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but not for channels right .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Yeah\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:okay okay\nIndustrial Designer:Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:um {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno . But users tend to tend to want to use that\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and once they lose out on the user experience they're like {disfmarker} Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:But that's not a bad thing is it ?\nProject Manager:Just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Jog dials are much easier than that .\nProject Manager:Okay um right well wouldn't it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You just roll .\nProject Manager:we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . Um I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite {disfmarker} you know th very quick to m to use .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? No . And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ?\nMarketing:Yeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here ,\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up\nMarketing:I dunno .\nProject Manager:so yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side ,\nProject Manager:Okay well if we can do that , great .\nMarketing:and that yeah {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah okay .\nMarketing:well I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ?\nProject Manager:Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um , and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So you wanna expand the shape of the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in .\nMarketing:It would get bumped , it's {disfmarker} doesn't really fit with your hand .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here .\nIndustrial Designer:Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ?\nProject Manager:Okay . Right I'm gonna have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:A jog di\nProject Manager:I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time .\nMarketing:Yeah\nProject Manager:Um is there anything anybody's unsure about ?\nMarketing:. It's kind of yeah {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Just for {disfmarker} in closing just {disfmarker} the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So um {vocalsound} that'll be that'll be good .\nMarketing:Huh .\nProject Manager:Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ?\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's what I was thinking the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:that'd be great .\nIndustrial Designer:a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:There's lots of space for it um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sure , yeah ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard .\nProject Manager:To make something flush with the case ?\nMarketing:Something a bit more flush , yeah ,\nProject Manager:Okay right .\nMarketing:or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:so that it has {disfmarker} and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .\nProject Manager:Sp kinda grippy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Feel like fruit .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Fruits kids {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:They feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not ,\nIndustrial Designer:No like {disfmarker} Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:they're actually just plastic that's textured ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah .\nMarketing:kind of a little bit like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . So um that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So off you go and design stuff\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:wooh {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Play-doh time .\nProject Manager:Yeah quite jealous actually .\nIndustrial Designer:You got to choose first . {vocalsound} No , we're kidding .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters . {vocalsound} Okay lemme {disfmarker} okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . It's you . Argh . This is a real hassle and a {disfmarker} oops . I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's {disfmarker} too lazy t take them off again . Cool .\n",
        "summary": "This meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control. Firstly, Marketing presented on the market trend and suggested a remote control with a fancy look and feel, technology innovation, and spongy material. Next, User Interface presented on conceptual design and recommended the control itself should use an inconsistent colour scheme. Then, Industrial Designer presented on the component design and that the cost, the complexity, and the size would have an impact on their remote design and reminded there would be a restriction on grouping plastic and rubber cases together. Lastly, the group discussed remote concepts and decided to have a small size remote with the speaker, the chip on print for the power, and a rubber case.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group\nMarketing:Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ?\nProject Manager:Um , yeah ,\nMarketing:S\nProject Manager:go for it mate .\nMarketing:Um , N_E_Z_\nProject Manager:N_ E_ Z_ .\nMarketing:E_R_ .\nProject Manager:Ebenezer . And your role is ?\nMarketing:I'm the Marketing Expert .\nProject Manager:You're the Marketing Expert , okay . Next we have ?\nIndustrial Designer:Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ .\nProject Manager:T_ R_ I_ K_ . And your role in this is ?\nIndustrial Designer:Industrial Designer .\nProject Manager:Industrial Designer . And , lastly we have ?\nUser Interface:Uh , Dave Cochrane .\nProject Manager:And you're going to be the User Interface ,\nUser Interface:User Interface Defin Designer , yes .\nProject Manager:is it ? Designer . Okay . Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh {vocalsound} personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . This is how today seems to be going to work . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um {disfmarker} First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right . {vocalsound} What can I say ? Ebenezer , you wanna have a {disfmarker} you wanna draw your favourite animal {vocalsound} ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sure . {vocalsound} Whiteboard . 'Kay . S okay . I will make this quick , since we don't have much time . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} 'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Here we have an elephant . First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant . So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer .\nProject Manager:Brilliantly done . Thank you . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thank you .\nProject Manager:Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Oh , um ,\nMarketing:Oh . Oh {vocalsound} oh\nProject Manager:you can clip them to your belt .\nIndustrial Designer:Do we take them off ?\nMarketing:I think you ga\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right ,\nProject Manager:You should also l um have your {disfmarker} the lapel mic on as well .\nIndustrial Designer:okay .\nMarketing:The little {disfmarker} The the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Ah-ha .\nMarketing:Oh that's good , we can clip them on . Okay . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Now where do I put the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Just um somewhere {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yep , the {gap} , it's just across there , that's it . Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Is this supposed to be clipped as well ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think so .\nProject Manager:It'll follow you if you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . There you go .\nProject Manager:You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . Should have good range .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh , destroying your elephant here .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh , here we have a tiger . Uh {disfmarker} I've always loved tigers . They're just {disfmarker} they're big , they're biggest cats , uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was {disfmarker} looks the best , the stripes , orange . My dad used to talk about {disfmarker} he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was {disfmarker} when I was a kid . And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . So uh that's why I like them . Didn't say an anything about me really but {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Excellent , thank you very much . Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um , the monkey , um . The one f uh {disfmarker} in fact this is a {gap} somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh {disfmarker} well my {disfmarker} I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . Um , monkeys have attitude . Which I think is a good thing . And I mean fr {vocalsound} and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . Um , so I like monkeys . And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Cheers . Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .\nMarketing:Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made ,\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:okay .\nProject Manager:Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?\nUser Interface:Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you {vocalsound} you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of {vocalsound} three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Absolutely prohibitive ,\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g {vocalsound} I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some {gap} and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for {vocalsound} um running macros .\nProject Manager:Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um\nProject Manager:Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Kay\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Any takes on this ?\nMarketing:Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and {vocalsound} the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television . They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah I've heard {disfmarker} I've seen the bar-code design before ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , it's it's taken out the {disfmarker} Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that .\nProject Manager:Okay , well\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:we can {disfmarker} we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so {vocalsound} we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out\nMarketing:What the user wants uh .\nProject Manager:what the user wants , yes .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um , right . Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ?\nMarketing:Oh . Okay , {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Like uh control pads , you know of games , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:or is that a bit ridiculous ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits {vocalsound} fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course , uh al al also allows for {gap} the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Okay . So ,\nUser Interface:A curve ,\nProject Manager:small , stylish , and something that's just a little different .\nUser Interface:mm-hmm . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , {vocalsound} uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway .\nProject Manager:Okay . That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . I would I would have hoped so anyway . Um , right . I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody . Yeah ?\nMarketing:'Kay . So .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .\n",
        "summary": "The team members introduced themselves and their positions respectively. Project Manager announced the plan for the three-phase remote control project. The team members drew their favourite animals to get more familiar with each other. Project Manager informed the team of their financial target, which was 50 million Euros. Each 25-Euro remote control would make a profit of 12.5 Euros. The team members had many ideas on the remote control design. User Interface recommended an integrating remote control for several different devices, as well as an ergonomic curve design. Marketing spotted a niche in the game market and thus suggested adopting a bar-code design. Industrial Designer added that the team could consider incorporating a keypad for the better game experience.",

She told me {disfmarker} she told me like two weeks ago .\nGrad A:Oh , well , it doesn't matter what time .\nGrad B:OK . You know how to toggle the display width {pause} function {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet .\nGrad D:Wow .\nGrad A:Anyway .\nGrad D:What is it ?\nGrad E:Let me explain something to you .\nGrad D:Um ,\nGrad E:My laugh is better than yours .\nGrad D:there .\nGrad A:I beg to differ .\nGrad B:Yo .\nGrad D:Um , OK .\nGrad A:But you have to say something genuinely funny before you 'll get an example .\nGrad E:Yeah .\nGrad D:The thing is I don't know how to get to the next page . Here .\nGrad E:No . You should be {disfmarker} at least be self - satisfied enough to laugh at your own jokes .\nGrad D:Actually I thought {disfmarker}\nGrad A:No , it 's a different laugh .\nGrad D:There .\nGrad A:Ooh , wow !\nGrad D:How weird .\nGrad E:Oh ! Holy mackerel .\nGrad A:Wow . Whoa !\nGrad D:What ? ! Oh . OK . I wasn't even doing anything . {vocalsound} OK .\nGrad A:Uh .\nGrad E:Eva 's got a laptop , she 's trying to show it off .\nGrad D:That was r actually Robert 's idea . But anyhow . Um\nProfessor F:O K . So , here we are .\nGrad E:Once again .\nProfessor F:Once again , right , together . Um , so we haven't had a meeting for a while , and {disfmarker} and probably won't have one next week , I think a number of people are gone . Um , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with EDU ?\nGrad B:Um , uh in a {disfmarker} in a smaller group we had uh , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection . So Fey 's time with us is almost officially over , and she brought us some thirty subjects and , t collected the data , and ten dialogues have been transcribed and can be looked at . If you 're interested in that , talk to me . Um , and we found another uh , cogsci student who 's interested in playing wizard for us . Here we 're gonna make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects , uh this round . She 's actually suggested to look um , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements . So they have to be subjected , {vocalsound} {comment} before they can actually graduate . And um , we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time , two days , for example , to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time , and , um , sort of package the whole thing in a {disfmarker} in a re in a few more complicated um , structure . That 's for the data collection . As for SmartKom , I 'm {disfmarker} the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which as of this morning should be resolved . And , so ,\nProfessor F:Good .\nGrad B:\" should be \" means they aren't yet , but {disfmarker} but I think I have the info now that I need . Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , so maybe uh uh , when tomorrow is over , we 're done . And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again Maybe it 'll take some more time , to be realistic , but at least we 're {disfmarker} we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there . That was that . Um , the uh , uh I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that 'll be done officially s once we 're done . Um , something happened , in {disfmarker} on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna look at today , and um , we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . Andreas , I think you 've met everyone except Nancy .\nGrad A:Sorry . Hi . Hi .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nGrad B:Hi . Hi .\nGrad A:So when you said \" Andreas \" I thought you were talking about Stolcke .\nGrad B:And , um ,\nGrad A:Now I know that we aren't , OK .\nGrad B:Andy , you actually go by Andy , right ? Oh , OK .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nGrad B:Eh {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Cuz there is another Andreas around ,\nGrad A:Hmm .\nGrad C:so , to avoid some confusion .\nGrad B:That will be {pause} Reuter ? Oh , OK .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nGrad B:So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University , one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied . And , um , the {disfmarker} um , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , and why it is s somewhat related , and {disfmarker} by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using . And um . Was that enough of an update ?\nProfessor F:I think so .\nGrad B:In what order shall we proceed ?\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad B:Maybe you have your on - line {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Uh , yeah , sure . Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah . OK . Um , I 've been looking at the PRM stuff . Um , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and {disfmarker} and you know , a time , a route , and then {disfmarker} and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually um , look at it more . It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time . Um , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to {disfmarker} The red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know um , reference slots to its preferences , um , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And {disfmarker} So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do , um {disfmarker} put in the computational nodes in between . And what that would look like in a PRM . And so I ended up making several classes {disfmarker} Actually , you know , a class of {disfmarker} with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are {disfmarker} s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , um , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the um , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in {disfmarker} in mind . And so for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a {disfmarker} I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would {disfmarker} c well , it 's probably the same . But um , No , you would definitely have {disfmarker} be able to re - use , like , {vocalsound} um , all the user stuff , and not {disfmarker} not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . So if you changed sites , you {disfmarker} you can , you know , save some work on that . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how um , using the PRM will help . Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this {disfmarker} this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would {disfmarker} basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this {disfmarker} no the dependencies would {disfmarker} of the queries would be reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all . Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff .\nProfessor F:Well\nGrad D:Right .\nProfessor F:No . So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is .\nGrad D:The output .\nProfessor F:So what decisions does this make ?\nGrad D:OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , um , how good it matches the needs of a user . And the other is the mode of the visit , whether th It 's the EVA decision . Um , so , instead of um , {vocalsound} doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of {disfmarker} the user wants to visit , I 'll come {disfmarker} well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . And for each site , you know , where {disfmarker} h how {disfmarker} how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . So . Anything else I missed ?\nProfessor F:So that was pretty quick . She 's ac uh uh Eva 's got a little write - up on it that uh , probably gives the {disfmarker} the details to anybody who needs them . Um , so the {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation .\nGrad D:No , not yet , um {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:OK . So one {disfmarker} so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:uh , we aren't gonna build our own interpreter , so if {disfmarker} if we can't find one , then we uh , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears . Uh , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . Uh , the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one , but , um , we 'll see . So w Anyway . So that 's a {disfmarker} a major open issue . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it . Uh , and we 'll see . Uh , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression . Whether the inference gets any faster or not I don't know . Uh , it wouldn't surprise me if it {disfmarker} if it doesn't .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:You know , it 's the same kind of information . I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net , uh , without going to some incredible hacking of {disfmarker} sort of rebuilding it on the fly . I mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net . So that was one of the main reasons for doing it . Um . I don't know . So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if {comment} Eva were able to come up with a {vocalsound} you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . And {disfmarker} you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever , and then plan a route .\nGrad B:Um - hmm , um , {vocalsound} well , first of all uh , uh , great looks , mu much cleaner , nnn , nnn , Certain {disfmarker} certain beauty in it , so , um , if beauty is truth , then , uh we 're in good shape . But , the um , as , uh , mentioned before we probably should look at t the details . So if you have a write - up then uh , I 'd love to read it\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:and uh {disfmarker} because , um , i Can you go all the way back to the {disfmarker} the very top ?\nGrad D:Yeah .\nGrad B:Um , {vocalsound} uh these {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} these {disfmarker} w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ?\nGrad D:I can't really see the whole thing .\nGrad B:or are they {disfmarker} have they changed , in a sense ?\nGrad D:Well I think I basically leave them to similar things .\nGrad B:Uh - huh .\nGrad D:Some of the things might {disfmarker} that might be different , maybe like {disfmarker} are that the hours for the site .\nGrad B:Hmm .\nGrad D:And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not .\nGrad B:Uh - huh .\nGrad D:And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} or stuff like that .\nGrad B:And the , uh , other question I would have is that presumably , from the way the Stanford people talk about it , you can put the probabilities also on the relations . If {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Which is the structural uncertainty ?\nProfessor F:Yeah . Yeah , I {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} That I think was actually in the previous {disfmarker} the Ubenth stuff . I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not ,\nGrad A:Mmm .\nProfessor F:uh , structural uncertainty .\nGrad B:It 's sort of in the definition or {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in Daphne 's definition of a PRM is that classes and relations ,\nProfessor F:OK .\nGrad B:and you 're gonna have CPT 's over the classes and their relations .\nProfessor F:Alright .\nGrad B:More uncertainty , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Uh ,\nGrad B:I should say .\nGrad D:I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure ,\nProfessor F:Yeah .\nGrad D:but I don't remember reading how you specify\nGrad B:Yeah , that would be exactly my question .\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad D:wh to start with . Yeah .\nGrad B:Well {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Yeah .\nProfessor F:Yeah . So , uh , the {disfmarker} the plan is {disfmarker} is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch and supposedly , um , we 'll actually get s deep {disfmarker} seriously connected to {disfmarker} to their work and\nGrad B:Yep .\nProfessor F:somebody 'll {disfmarker} Uh , you know {disfmarker} If it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever . So , we 'll actually figure all this out .\nGrad B:OK . OK . Then I think the w {vocalsound} long term perspective is {disfmarker} is pretty clear . We get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , if , when , and how , then this becomes foregrounded\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:profiled , focused , again .\nGrad E:Designated ?\nGrad A:Of course .\nGrad B:And um , until then we 'll come up with a something that 's {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} that 's way more complicated for you . Right ?\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad B:Because this was laughingly easy , right ?\nGrad D:Actually I had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff , cuz I {disfmarker} I made it really complicated in the beginning , and Jerry was like , {vocalsound} \" this is just too much \" .\nProfessor F:Yeah . So , um , you could , from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together and you wanted to plan something that somehow , with some Pareto optimal uh , {vocalsound} uh , thing for {disfmarker}\nGrad A:That 's good . That 's definitely a job for artificial intelligence .\nProfessor F:uh , or {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Except for humans can't really solve it either , so .\nGrad B:Well that 's not {disfmarker} not even something humans {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor F:Right . Right . Well that 's the {disfmarker} that would {disfmarker} that would be a {disfmarker} uh , you could sell it , as a {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Yeah .\nProfessor F:OK , eh you don't have to fight about this , just give your preferences to the {disfmarker}\nGrad A:And then you can blame the computer .\nProfessor F:w Exactly .\nGrad A:So .\nGrad B:Hmm . But what does it {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Would a pote potential result be to {disfmarker} to split up and never talk to each other again ? You know .\nGrad A:That should be one of them .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nProfessor F:Yeah . Right .\nGrad E:That 'd be nice .\nGrad A:Mmm .\nProfessor F:Anyway . So . So there i there are some {disfmarker} some u uh , you know , uh , elaborations of this that you could try to put in to this structure , but I don't think it 's worth it now . Because we 're gonna see what {disfmarker} what else uh {disfmarker} what else we 're gonna do . Anyway . But uh , it 's good , yeah and {disfmarker} and there were a couple other ideas of {disfmarker} of uh , things for Eva to look at in {disfmarker} in the interim .\nGrad B:Good . Then , we can move on and see what Andreas has got out his sleeve . Or Andy , for that matter ?\nGrad C:OK . So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . Um , so maybe just a {disfmarker} a little background on {disfmarker} on my visit . So , uh , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , uh , the {disfmarker} the reason is really for me uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And {disfmarker} and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and um , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and {disfmarker} and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you and {disfmarker} and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more and {disfmarker} and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and and then {disfmarker} and ask some {disfmarker} some questions , uh , in a couple days . So I 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week . OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . So um , uh what 's uh {disfmarker} Sort of the state of the art there is to um {disfmarker} uh you have a bunch of {disfmarker} of uh documents or learning units or learning objects , um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E , uh {disfmarker} There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on . Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh {disfmarker} with the document , and one is uh , you have sort of a , um , well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} of the units . Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh , I think that 's a {disfmarker} that 's a very {disfmarker} that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and uh {disfmarker} As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then {disfmarker} But that 's really all that we have at the moment . So I think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there . Now , what this uh {disfmarker} a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really {disfmarker} Um , so what I 'm {disfmarker} what I try to do is um , to have um , uh {disfmarker} So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , what {disfmarker} what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not {disfmarker} it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what I want to build is basically a {disfmarker} a smart F A Q system . Now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than \" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . \" So . And I think that I don't need to tell you this . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure you have the same {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context it , and {disfmarker} and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the {disfmarker} in the context of {disfmarker} in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered . So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . Now , um , basically giving this um {disfmarker} Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of {disfmarker} of certain terms and keywords comes in again . And , using this and some {disfmarker} some uh , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some {disfmarker} some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about {disfmarker} uh , working on {disfmarker} on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used {disfmarker} are written in Java . So some {disfmarker} some inferences like that , now , um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um {disfmarker} off the documents you 're {disfmarker} you 're searching against . So , uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um {disfmarker} given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh {disfmarker} uh {pause} try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um {disfmarker} steepest descent approach . So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And {disfmarker} and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , and find out which um {disfmarker} which questions are worth um , asking . And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and {disfmarker} and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that {disfmarker} that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . And so , uh what I 'm {disfmarker} What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources , and {disfmarker} and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with . Trying to {disfmarker} to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh {disfmarker} representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , um , what you can do with those . Um . What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model . That {disfmarker} that probably isn't expressive enough . So . So that 's another thing , um , which I think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now . And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository {disfmarker} depending on which {disfmarker} um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it {disfmarker} it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results . So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a {disfmarker} a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's {disfmarker} probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine . So these are some of the {disfmarker} just in a nutshell , some of the ideas . And I think a lot of the {disfmarker} even though it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are {disfmarker} are fairly similar . So . OK .\nGrad A:And so some of the {disfmarker} I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I {disfmarker} Are you {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it .\nGrad A:So it seems like a lot of {disfmarker} some of the issues are the same . It 's like , um , you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret ,\nGrad C:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:um , s how to interpret . In {disfmarker} in this case , infer in in knowing {disfmarker} wanting to know what kinds of things to ask . We - we 've kind of talked about that , but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:But maybe you guys had that in the previous models .\nGrad B:Well , in a {disfmarker} in one {disfmarker} t one s mmm , small difference in a {disfmarker} in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer , but he wants to point to the places w w\nGrad A:Documents that have the answers .\nGrad C:Yeah , so . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not building an expert {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:Uh , I want to build a smart librarian , basically\nGrad A:Right . Right .\nGrad C:that can point you to the right reference . I don't wanna compute the answer , so it 's a little bit easier for me .\nGrad B:Well . Uh , you have to s still m understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to what you think the informational needs {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:So you also don't have to figure out what the content is . You 're just taking the keywords as a topic text , as {disfmarker}\nGrad C:I {disfmarker} I assume that {disfmarker} that the there will be learning systems that {disfmarker} that tag their {disfmarker} their content .\nGrad A:OK . Right .\nGrad C:And um , um , m @ @ and basically what I {disfmarker} what I envision is that you {disfmarker} rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . So \" this document explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux \" or something like this .\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:So . So something {disfmarker} something very specific that you can then {disfmarker} But the {disfmarker} I think that the key point with these uh , learning systems is that uh , a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it {disfmarker} it carries .\nGrad A:Mmm , mm - hmm .\nGrad C:You can have the best learning system with the best search interface , if there 's no content inside of it , it 's not very useful . So I think ultimately because um , uh developing these {disfmarker} these rules and these inference uh {disfmarker} inferences I think is very costly , so um , uh I think you must be able to reuse some {disfmarker} some existing um , domain {disfmarker} domain information , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or ontologies that {disfmarker} that uh other people wrote and then try to integrate them , and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small uh , content management system .\nGrad A:OK . Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:So I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's crucial for {disfmarker} for the success of {disfmarker} or @ @ {disfmarker}\nGrad A:So , you 're not {disfmarker} I guess I 'm trying to figure out how {disfmarker} how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups ,\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , and I 'm guessing that you {disfmarker} you won't be doing that ? OK .\nGrad C:No .\nGrad A:Just checking . So , {vocalsound} OK .\nGrad B:Hmm .\nGrad C:No .\nGrad A:So , you take the query , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:On the other hand , uh , FrameNet could well be useful . So do you know the FrameNet story ?\nGrad C:Um , yeah . Uh , not {disfmarker} not too much ,\nProfessor F:OK .\nGrad C:but uh ,\nProfessor F:Oh . Th - that 's another thing you might wanna look into while you 're here .\nGrad C:I have a rough overview .\nProfessor F:Because , um , you know , the standard story is that keyworks {disfmarker} keywords evoke frames , and the frames may well give you additional keywords or uh , if you know that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that a {disfmarker} a bunch of keywords uh , indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just uh , individual {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Mmm . Mmm .\nProfessor F:So there 's a lot of stuff , and people are looking at that . Most of the work here is just trying to get the frames right . There 's linguists and stuff and there 's a lot of it and they 're {disfmarker} they 're busily working away . But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it . And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that .\nGrad C:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about um , yeah , just how to {disfmarker} how to come up with these structures ,\nGrad A:Mmm .\nGrad C:cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's very easy to whip up something quickly , but it maybe then makes sense to {disfmarker} to me , but not to anybody else , and {disfmarker} and if we want to share and integrate things , they must {disfmarker} well , they must be well designed really .\nGrad B:Remember the uh , Prashant story ?\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad B:The absolutely no {disfmarker} no linguistic background person that the IU sent over here .\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad B:And Andreas and I tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh {disfmarker} with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would p do some of the work for this machine ,\nProfessor F:Right . Yeah .\nGrad B:which uh , never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation\nProfessor F:W yeah , I know , I mean it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} w he did w what {disfmarker} what he did was much more s sensible for him .\nGrad B:which in the {disfmarker} Absolutely . Yeah .\nProfessor F:I think uh ,\nGrad B:But so {disfmarker} I 'm just saying , the uh , we had that idea\nProfessor F:you know {disfmarker} Yeah . The idea was there . Yeah , OK .\nGrad B:uh to {disfmarker} to exploit FrameNet there as well .\nProfessor F:Yeah .\nGrad A:Hmm .\nGrad B:And um .\nProfessor F:Yeah , actually you guys never {disfmarker}\nGrad B:And Srini 's doing information extraction also , right ?\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad B:with that FrameNet base .\nGrad C:Mmm .\nProfessor F:Yeah .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:So you {disfmarker} you guys never sent anybody else from I U .\nGrad C:Except {disfmarker} except Prashant ?\nProfessor F:You were y no {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad C:Um ,\nProfessor F:Uh , this was supposedly an exchange program , and {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} you know , it 's fine . We don't care , but it just {disfmarker} I 'm a little surprised that uh , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send .\nGrad A:Hmm .\nGrad C:Uh I don't know , I mean the uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Alright . I mean I had forgotten a I {disfmarker} To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program .\nGrad B:Uh it 's in the program ?\nGrad C:Uh I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's really the lack of students uh , at IU at the moment .\nProfessor F:Yeah . Yeah . No , no . There was a whole co There was a little contract signed . It was {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad C:Yeah , yeah . I think it 's ju it 's more the lack of {disfmarker} of students , really , and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams .\nProfessor F:Yeah , I know .\nGrad A:Mmm .\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad C:But {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad C:Well I mean if {disfmarker} if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than work for some German {vocalsound} {nonvocalsound} company , or {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Yeah . Right .\nGrad B:You are being recorded right now , so beware .\nProfessor F:Oh , right !\nGrad C:Well , I didn't say anybody to {disfmarker} anything to offend {disfmarker} well , except for the sponsors maybe , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Right . Anyway . Right . So I thi tha that 's {disfmarker} that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:Uh , unfortunately , Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm . Well I 'll go to the uh , Semantic Web Workshop , uh , in two weeks .\nProfessor F:Right , and {disfmarker} Yeah , for {disfmarker} for some reason he 's not doing that .\nGrad A:Yeah . Well , he had other things to do .\nProfessor F:I don't know why he @ @ {disfmarker} oh , I , who knows ?\nGrad A:The uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Anyway , s yeah , you 'll see {disfmarker} you 'll certainly see a lot of the people there .\nGrad A:The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? because he did some work on topic spotting\nProfessor F:Yeah . St - statistical stuff . That would be a very good idea .\nGrad A:w um , which is , I mean , you {disfmarker} I mean . I don't {disfmarker} Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end ,\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:you know , like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that figure out {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} There 's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on {disfmarker} has worked on that kinda stuff , and he 's worked with frame net , so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:So . And he just finished writing a draft of his thesis . So . I u {vocalsound} Dan Gildea , GILDEA .\nGrad C:So , uh , who is that again ?\nGrad A:And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff ,\nGrad B:Who ? I can take you to his office .\nGrad A:and {disfmarker}\nGrad B:It 's just around the corner .\nGrad C:OK , great .\nGrad A:Hmm . Well , if you fal solve the problem , {vocalsound} hope you can do one for us too .\nProfessor F:Alright , was there anything else for this ? One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal .\nGrad B:Yeah . I 'm sure . I have um {disfmarker} I think it was November two thousand three or some {disfmarker} No . Wh - I had something in my calendar .\nProfessor F:Oh , OK . Right .\nGrad B:Um ,\nGrad E:Wait a second . That 's a long way away .\nProfessor F:Good thinking !\nGrad B:Uh well , maybe I can {disfmarker} I can bribe my way out of this . So . So I did some double checking and it seems like spring break in two thousand {vocalsound} one .\nGrad A:Talk about changing the topic .\nGrad B:No .\nProfessor F:Well , no , but he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes .\nGrad A:At least this is a private meeting . Right , exactly , OK , that 's the link .\nGrad B:This uh {disfmarker} Oh , they refused the budget again ? Is it {disfmarker} so about CITRIS ? Yeah , still nothing .\nProfessor F:Uh , this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} t the s we 're , uh , involved in a literally three hundred million dollar uh , program . Uh , with the State of California . And , the State of California is now a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget . So the budget has not been approved . And two days ago {disfmarker} There 's two l you know , so , two branches of legislature . One branch approved it ,\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:and , um , yesterdayday {comment} there was this uh {disfmarker} uh I thought that the other branch would just approve it , but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who {disfmarker} who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So , um {disfmarker} Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ? And then we 'll go . So , I {disfmarker} it turns out I wound up having lunch today with a guy named Tom Kalil . KILL {disfmarker} KALIL . And , uh , he now works at Berkeley . In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they {disfmarker} So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , uh , they think the money 's coming . So {disfmarker} and he was , I think , the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters . He was in the White House , I don't remember what he was saying . A anyway , like that . And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in uh , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . So that 's s interesting to me but maybe not to you . But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , \" for example \" , this was his only example , \" if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , and as compelling as a video game , then that would have a huge social impact \" . I said , \" Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . \" Anyway . So it was nice that uh , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , uh , language would be a good way to do it .\nGrad A:Mmm . Definitely .\nProfessor F:So that 's {disfmarker} So anyway , that 's the end of the story .\nGrad A:But for adults and not for the children .\nProfessor F:This was {disfmarker} Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing ,\nGrad A:Uh - huh .\nProfessor F:but , uh , you know , a again , if {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if you\nGrad A:Oh .\nProfessor F:um , and this was {disfmarker} this was literacy , which actually is somewhat different problem .\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:Maybe easier . I don't know . So this is reading , rather than teaching {disfmarker} Another project we started on , and {disfmarker} and didn't get funded for was , uh , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English . Which is like half the school population in California . Something like that ,\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:isn't it ? Yeah . So , enormous problem in California , and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build {vocalsound} uh , programs that would be tutors for the kids . We think we could . Anyway . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} But this is a slightly different problem ,\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:and um , I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , but it i it 's {disfmarker} it 's interesting and I may um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that . So anyway , that was {disfmarker} that was today 's little story .\nGrad E:Hmm .\nGrad B:OK . So I {disfmarker} I did manage to get {disfmarker} pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS ,\nProfessor F:No , no .\nGrad B:but uh or {disfmarker} a temporarily putting it out of the sling\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad B:but , I {disfmarker} I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings ,\nProfessor F:Yeah .\nGrad B:and also revising , thanks for all the comments , the c the original construal proposal . And , if I put one and one together , I may end up with a number that 's greater than one and that I {disfmarker} I can potentially present once you get back .\nGrad A:Greater than two ?\nProfessor F:You 're good .\nGrad B:Nnn . {comment} s sometimes , you know the sum is not uh less than the {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Uh , right , right .\nProfessor F:Right . Right . Anyway . Yeah , so {disfmarker} OK , so that 'd be great , but I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's time again , right ?\nGrad B:Absolutely . Yeah .\nProfessor F:Yeah . OK .\nGrad B:But um , and hopefully all sidetracking um , other things will have disappeared , soon .\nProfessor F:Good . Yep . Done ?\n",

An alternative representation of the Bayes-net, it depicts context features as classes, and dependencies as relations between them. Following this, a visiting researcher presented an overview of a parallel project at the International University. It attempts to build a smart tutoring system for a computer science course. The assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results, if they take into account contextual parameters (user, situation).

No , that's okay . Joost , your mouse .\nMarketing:What ?\nUser Interface:No mouse needed ?\nMarketing:I've got a touch-pad .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Do you know how how I can wake it up ?\nUser Interface:A touch-pad ?\nMarketing:No , my laptop .\nUser Interface:Slap it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You with your brilliant ideas . I don't know if I can touch the power button . Do you know how how I can wake it up ?\nUser Interface:Is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No . Yeah . Try the power button .\nMarketing:Oh .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Come on , move it .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Now , wake up , bitch .\nProject Manager:Huh .\nUser Interface:F_ five . F_ five {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:I've lost my screen . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , so did I .\nUser Interface:I don't .\nMarketing:I closed it . That wasn that wasn't very smart , I guess .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Come on . Get back to me . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I closed the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I closed it .\nUser Interface:You've got your name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , my name is name .\nMarketing:No , I didn't restart it , I just closed it . Yes .\nUser Interface:Hope it working .\nMarketing:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:Never close your laptop .\nProject Manager:Yeah ? Everybody's ready ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Great . Thanks .\nProject Manager:Great . Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . I uh forgot to put my name over here , it's uh {vocalsound} it's Martin . Uh , so you all know .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , this is the agenda for today . Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes . Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Uh , some of the {vocalsound} oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . So now we all know what our\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:goal is . Um , I {disfmarker} oh forget {disfmarker} I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Joost , Guido , Antek .\nUser Interface:What is your name ?\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Antek .\nUser Interface:Antek Ahmet . And Joost . {gap}\nProject Manager:Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um {disfmarker} there's a document folder called um the sh {vocalsound} shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th\nUser Interface:Can we see the white-board on our laptops ?\nProject Manager:No , no . Just on the on the screen over there .\nUser Interface:No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop {gap} . Is is {disfmarker} if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's {disfmarker} I don't know if it's important .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here . It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we {disfmarker} well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this . Oh . {vocalsound} If pen is selected , yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh , no no .\nUser Interface:With that pen ?\nProject Manager:It's not {disfmarker} But it is pen . It's not working like a pen yet .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Huh . Huh .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen .\nUser Interface:Little bit slower .\nProject Manager:You can use an eraser . And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . So , it's quite easy . Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright . Oh , let me think . Different colours . Oh .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} piranha . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . I'm gonna use some different colour {gap} now .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Some {disfmarker} a little white . Looks like a fish . Think it is . Oh .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh . {vocalsound} Uh , colour . This is black ? I think so .\nUser Interface:Yellow {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh . Oh , this is just uh {vocalsound} useless uh drawings but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh teeth . I need teeth . {vocalsound} Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . What was uh {disfmarker} I have su to sum up its favourite characteris\nUser Interface:Different .\nProject Manager:Well , I like its uh sharp {disfmarker} razor sharp teeth . {vocalsound} Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . And I like its overall uh aggressive look and {disfmarker} Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Well , who wants to be next ?\nMarketing:Nobody , I guess . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You go , Guido ? Okay . Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank .\nUser Interface:Blank ?\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:Okay . Then pen again ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:And uh {disfmarker} so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths .\nUser Interface:Okay , um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Format .\nUser Interface:{gap} control . Uh {disfmarker} Ah , purple . Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh I will {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You know , I thought of that actually .\nUser Interface:That's my bird . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Isn't it quite {disfmarker} it's a little bit light .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh , another colour maybe . A red one .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A small one . Uh , line width . Two ? Three . Oh that's okay . That's another one .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Ano {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} it's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Its simplicity . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that .\nProject Manager:Oh , okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:Maybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know .\nProject Manager:Okay . No , uh it's clear .\nUser Interface:So {gap} more uh birds ?\nProject Manager:N no {vocalsound} no .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We get your point . Okay . Who wants to be next ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} Okay , {vocalsound} okay , {vocalsound} okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , whatever . I'll go next .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thanks .\nUser Interface:M\nMarketing:I haven't got a favourite animal too , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Pictionary . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh . {vocalsound} What should I draw ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:A cow .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Thank you ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'll draw a penguin . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I'll draw a penguin . Whatever . I can't draw , so you can start to laugh already .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I'll do so . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Whatever . Something like that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Come on .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's little bit hard .\nMarketing:Mm hmm hmm , orange .\nUser Interface:Orange , of course .\nMarketing:Whatever .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh , {vocalsound} it's better than your bird .\nUser Interface:{gap} Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Everything's better than your bird .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} True .\nMarketing:Whatever .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hey , it's blue . No . Whatever . Um , I like its ugliness {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , whatever . The way it walks or whatever .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Your turn .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Drawing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm going to draw a cat . I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And you can have them at home .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well , you can have a piranha at home .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ye yes , {vocalsound} yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Huh .\nMarketing:Or a line .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A little bit . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I mean a bird . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Don't mess with my birds , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not very uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm . It's a handicapped cat .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} cat .\nProject Manager:I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ah , it's not scared . He's crying but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} . Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} What do you like about it then ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh it's i most cats are small .\nProject Manager:Oh , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:You can handle them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Okay ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I wouldn't call it training , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager:Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when {disfmarker} well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh {disfmarker} know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ?\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever .\nUser Interface:Different .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Different functions of of uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this {vocalsound} {disfmarker} or whatever o o other functions {vocalsound} totally somewhere else .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah .\nMarketing:I think we should group them .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t\nProject Manager:And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um {disfmarker} what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ?\nMarketing:Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's what , from my experience .\nUser Interface:But isn't it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television .\nProject Manager:Okay . But we gonna {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's only for television , I thought . Not {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes .\nProject Manager:Oh , it is only for televis\nUser Interface:{gap} I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .\nMarketing:Yes , it is only for television , but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So wha what {disfmarker} What wha {vocalsound} what uh what document {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker} well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it .\nProject Manager:But , where where did it uh {disfmarker} Where did you find that ?\nUser Interface:Uh , in the email .\nProject Manager:Oh , okay .\nUser Interface:I thought it said uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's right . It's a television remote control .\nUser Interface:Yeah , television remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . So we can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , that's uh something extras .\nProject Manager:No , we have to think about that .\nUser Interface:True . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:True .\nMarketing:Yep .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . True .\nIndustrial Designer:Only the experts . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I guess .\nProject Manager:Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the {disfmarker} uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh my God . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , to go with to go with fashion and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Maybe a can opener underneath it ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} For the bear . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I I uh , no I think it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably .\nUser Interface:Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market .\nMarketing:Yeah , way too high . Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's international , so we have to use a standard .\nProject Manager:Well , m has to be something {vocalsound} spectacular or uh one which makes it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well that's an idea of course , yeah .\nProject Manager:We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:original , trendly , and user-friendly {disfmarker} Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:or we should make it combination of that . 'Kay , so you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it .\nUser Interface:Use friendly . Yep .\nProject Manager:Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . {vocalsound} Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some {disfmarker} {gap} Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yes , what the market wishes .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well , the closing . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh {disfmarker} Already s said that . The User Interface Designer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} is it a User Inter User Interface {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Interface d\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh {disfmarker} the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . I don't know how much time we have left .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh , not many I guess . We started at twelve .\nMarketing:You just got a message .\nProject Manager:Oh , and what does it said ?\nMarketing:And it said uh five minutes , so we got four and a half .\nUser Interface:Oh , I don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:W Okay , well um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I didn't get a message .\nMarketing:No . He's the whatever .\nUser Interface:Oh , the Project Manager .\nIndustrial Designer:Team Leader . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , we're uh ahead of schedule then .\nMarketing:Team Leader . {vocalsound} He is the whatever . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , close it . I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes .\nProject Manager:And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:You can all {disfmarker} Or we're all uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down\nMarketing:Alright .\nProject Manager:and then we're ready .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Or we can leave already {gap} I guess .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap} or uh or sh or should we uh {disfmarker} or is important that we leave at exact uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:No . I don't think so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I don't think {disfmarker} Oh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yes ?\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nMarketing:Great .\nProject Manager:We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Good luck .\nProject Manager:Yeah , good luck .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I will need it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I will need it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\n",

So we are here for the functional design meeting mm {vocalsound} so first I will show the agenda so we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board . Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . Of the {disfmarker} of the process . So uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did ?\nIndustrial Designer:F do you want to start ?\nUser Interface:Make a start yeah .\nProject Manager:You can start .\nUser Interface:So . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Cable , camera .\nProject Manager:You have uh PowerPoint ?\nUser Interface:Should be in my {disfmarker} in their folder no ?\nProject Manager:Ah yeah maybe there . Okay .\nUser Interface:Up .\nProject Manager:Who are you ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um at three I think .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No ? {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager:Ouch . And {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We have a technical problem uh .\nUser Interface:Do we think w s in the {disfmarker} in the wrong folder maybe ? {vocalsound} It is possible .\nProject Manager:You put it on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:It was somewhere in something like this . I don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something .\nIndustrial Designer:What do you have in short cut ?\nUser Interface:Go up .\nIndustrial Designer:Participant two .\nUser Interface:Yeah go up .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Again . No . Go back .\nProject Manager:You have no {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh maybe messenger AMI . Messenger .\nProject Manager:Over . Okay .\nUser Interface:No . There is nothing .\nProject Manager:There's no {disfmarker} We have a technical problem .\nUser Interface:Let's go and check .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I'll go and check .\nIndustrial Designer:Otherwise , could you just describe by hand ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:With the the whiteboard ?\nProject Manager:If you remember yeah\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:but that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So uh . Basically {vocalsound} what we want here is a remote control right .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So um the question well first of all what to control . So {vocalsound} most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And {disfmarker} but other people want th also remotes for {vocalsound} controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . So {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:there is one {disfmarker} that is one thing . The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:uh at the same time as {disfmarker} and general voice commands if you want yeah . {vocalsound} So I think it should be a package in that case .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . {vocalsound} One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . {vocalsound} Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:a set of buttons for {vocalsound} linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:What do you mean by linear access then ?\nUser Interface:Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah .\nProject Manager:Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:and there's a fourth one no ?\nUser Interface:Mm ?\nProject Manager:So the better now for special navigation ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ?\nProject Manager:Okay . Then linear access\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:then random access .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah and also parameter changing .\nProject Manager:Ah yeah parameter okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and {vocalsound} basically this is most of the {disfmarker} almost everybody has this stuff .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay and and voice command did you uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Voice command w we could specify anything . We could assign any button {disfmarker} a command to any button , if we have enough processing power ,\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:I guess so . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So that's uh that close your investigations ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh yeah I think so .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Not so far .\nProject Manager:Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} Um I dunno if you can open the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I dunno if I can open it . Maybe you can s\nMarketing:uh m is not here .\nProject Manager:It's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh in {disfmarker} yeah okay .\nProject Manager:Messenger no ?\nMarketing:No . In document {gap} . Mm computer yeah .\nProject Manager:In which folder ?\nUser Interface:Where did you put it ?\nMarketing:Here . Here .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Short-cut to AMI shared folder ?\nUser Interface:{gap} mm .\nMarketing:But it's not {disfmarker} Um .\nProject Manager:Maybe you can send it to me by email . Just to participant one . At AMI .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah , I can do that .\nProject Manager:I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable .\nMarketing:Okay . Um .\nProject Manager:You send it ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's participant one ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Uh this is this email .\nUser Interface:I'm designing the user interface . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . You can uh .\nProject Manager:Okay . So maybe I can switch slides when you {disfmarker} whenever you ask ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:that will be more convenient . So okay , functional requirements .\nMarketing:Okay so you can {disfmarker} you can go . Okay so {vocalsound} in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:and the subjects also filled a questionnaire\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:okay ? And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more {vocalsound} more nice , more kind . Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . {vocalsound} Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:oh {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} it's not good . {vocalsound} So okay .\nProject Manager:We can just keep doing that ?\nMarketing:So it's not in theory {disfmarker} but I I can I can say yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . So mm {vocalsound} we have to have a remote control uh very um {vocalsound} out for that . {vocalsound} Uh the buttons have {disfmarker} are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh {vocalsound} ten per cents of but of the buttons in the {disfmarker} in the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So all the buttons we we have to put are {disfmarker} have to to have um a use a real use\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:and not only or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , so fewer buttons maybe would be good ?\nMarketing:Yeah . F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:But what kind of remote controls did you look at ?\nMarketing:Sorry ?\nUser Interface:What kind of task was it ? It was a T_V_ ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Uh {vocalsound} most for most is T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah but in fact we {disfmarker} it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management\nUser Interface:Huh .\nProject Manager:bo I will present them in the following .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh . Ah ! Good .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} 'Kay you can go so .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to {vocalsound} to\nProject Manager:Yeah . To find it .\nMarketing:to find it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um and um lot of the time they {disfmarker} it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And uh remote controls are bad for\nProject Manager:What is her other side ?\nMarketing:R_S_I_ {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Other side yeah , yo wa your wrist\nMarketing:I dunno .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It i can become painful you can have tendonditis .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I did not knew that .\nUser Interface:If you also {gap} up on a computer in a strange position .\nProject Manager:Okay so you {disfmarker} we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah .\nUser Interface:Ergonomic . But uh {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Have to say ha ha . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's your job {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh .\nProject Manager:Uh sorry {vocalsound} got a message from Microsoft . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay um before that I I have some some {vocalsound} some thing {vocalsound} uh to say before um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:and uh and not uh a lot for setting {disfmarker} for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . This function should be very uh accessible .\nMarketing:Very accessible yes .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay . This is the main function okay .\nMarketing:That's right . {vocalsound} So then we asked some questions to them\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and you can go {vocalsound} we have here the results of\nUser Interface:The first question .\nMarketing:of the questions . So you know that um\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} for the younger it's very important\nProject Manager:To have L_C_D_ and voice .\nMarketing:to have the s yes and speech recognition . And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in .\nProject Manager:Yeah maybe this this is important .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:we have to take care of that point of view I think or so .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} An I s no , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay these are the user requi\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I dunno if you see something else important or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm just thinking of some thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker} We want to have a {disfmarker} no , I don't know if this is a good idea . We want to have a a general remote control for everything .\nProject Manager:No no no . We {disfmarker} w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . From the management board I receive an email .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it's not true I think . The the second claim that you put .\nIndustrial Designer:No no . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That it would be too long to develop .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think that should be the same .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah . Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . So maybe it's a good decision . I dunno . What's your opinion ?\nUser Interface:I have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I don't think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Finish tonight .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation , it would be al you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but I think we have some technical problem or so . So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control .\nProject Manager:Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do\nIndustrial Designer:If fact {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Do I have {disfmarker} oh yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Now I have enough cables .\nUser Interface:Like a {disfmarker} you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay so I'm just going to describe {disfmarker} in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . We just have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:sorry , I'm going {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Are you okay ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Like that . I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that um something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . Push button or a L_C_D_ . After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared {disfmarker} um which is a an infrared um component . And so what we {disfmarker} for for myself this {disfmarker} for for us this is quite easy .\nProject Manager:U_C_ is the central unit ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Y it's a {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} this just a chip which does all the um numerical\nProject Manager:Computation .\nIndustrial Designer:numerical computation according to your display .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And so for us uh this is quite easy . We just need to take {disfmarker} to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the {disfmarker} not the {disfmarker} to the television .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So for us this is quite easy .\nProject Manager:Okay so this is quite easy . There is not that much constraints .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} This will {disfmarker} think this will take more time to develop also .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah of course of course .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And um but for a standard one this is really easy . It's a question of one month and so on s\nUser Interface:Soon .\nProject Manager:To have a {disfmarker} you s you speak about with voi voice control ?\nIndustrial Designer:No no no no ,\nProject Manager:Standard button one .\nIndustrial Designer:I say {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Definitely .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Ten years .\nIndustrial Designer:I would say {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I would say uh about eight months to have the first results .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay so i it's a bit long yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I can {disfmarker} Um .\nProject Manager:One month for the standard one with button .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah even . I mean that this is really standard devices now . Um eight . For uh speech recognition .\nProject Manager:Okay yeah . Okay so we can take this into account . So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ?\nUser Interface:But we don't have time to market .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah it will .\nIndustrial Designer:And also {disfmarker} how much uh I think\nUser Interface:I think we should contact management .\nIndustrial Designer:during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't {disfmarker} we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Euros . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so how many units should we sell to have a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but how many {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:How muc how much do you get {disfmarker} how much do you {disfmarker} if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Eh chips . We're gonna need chips right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Because we are {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah ? Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:we can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So .\nProject Manager:It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting .\nUser Interface:No it doesn't .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay . Four million . {gap}\nProject Manager:Okay . Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah I I will continue .\nIndustrial Designer:Is it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well ask your question if you want .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent\nMarketing:Mm ?\nIndustrial Designer:of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? To to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that .\nMarketing:Would j Uh {vocalsound} yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . It's not intuitive first .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? You say that I want , I have six button {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mh-hmm . A a lot of people are uh {disfmarker} if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But , but also it seems that {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so it's really something for the expert user . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:I mean there are markets and markets . I think the young people are th uh are uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Christine here said uh you have a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} uh it is yeah . {vocalsound} So for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . I guess . I don't know if there is study about that .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple {vocalsound} than creating a simple product .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:And there are {disfmarker} another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:All right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has {disfmarker} somebody has to learn to use it first .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But also we we see that that most people find it {disfmarker} find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . Losed lose it etcetera .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:These {disfmarker} these are {disfmarker} these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So but le let us see first the new requirement . So we don't have to {disfmarker} so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But teletext is just one button .\nProject Manager:Yeah but then you have to {disfmarker} you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff .\nUser Interface:You you just write the {disfmarker} write the numbers .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So will you add with the channel keys , right ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users ,\nUser Interface:So . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:they prefer to s\nUser Interface:I am . I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I dunno .\nUser Interface:So .\nProject Manager:If i one button is still one more button . If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Well anyway I have this point . We can discuss . Also um {disfmarker} so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the {disfmarker} on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . So this is the the key point .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the {disfmarker} o th of the control {disfmarker} of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .\nUser Interface:Capital .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , no ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah okay . So yeah the key point here is simple . Maybe . {vocalsound} So few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ?\nUser Interface:Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:really .\nProject Manager:Maybe switch T_V_ on and off {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can {disfmarker} revenue can come back to us .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Or something .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:And that's all ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of {disfmarker} a lot of zapping .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now ,\nUser Interface:It's a memory , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah this is cool . Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button . So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And uh and of course the channel changing buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . I I talk about that , yeah ?\nUser Interface:How should they how should we implement that ? Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Let's say that we can do something like that . This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five .\nProject Manager:We go faster ?\nIndustrial Designer:To go fa to go faster .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm . It's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . So if you you have your ten buttons for the {disfmarker} for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have {disfmarker} instead of having just one memory\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:you have if you press them for a long time {disfmarker} No . Doesn't work {vocalsound} does it .\nProject Manager:Maybe we should have also a digit button {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Change channel to eight .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental .\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I dunno bec because if you have the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot {disfmarker} you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental .\nProject Manager:Uh . Yeah . Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So I think we need also digits .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits .\nUser Interface:Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Or we can do something like that .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We can design the remote control to have access . You know some remote control have uh protection\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and so you you y\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Hey I just thought this thing {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:there is a {disfmarker} I mean you know there is are some {gap} with a wheel like this . Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , a kind of joystick .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} and uh yeah I think this is the basi\nUser Interface:On the lower side I think it {disfmarker} you have to turn it .\nProject Manager:And do we {disfmarker} do we have a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No ? If we do that .\nIndustrial Designer:Or a {disfmarker} or a ball , yeah , not a a wheel but a ball , and you say uh to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No , a wheel is better .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I would say the wheel is better .\nUser Interface:Because of that {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What is the expert of uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The channels change one by one .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's a good idea .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:'S quite {disfmarker} it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the {disfmarker} on the wheel .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Even if i L_E_D_ uh or a if if it's the L_C_D_ feature uh\nIndustrial Designer:A blue {disfmarker} a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:whatever , yeah .\nProject Manager:and do we put an L_C_D_ display ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Because it was important for young customers if you remember .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think it's only put on if cou have multi function . If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Just increase the cost .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The user does not have an advantage really .\nProject Manager:So no L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process\nUser Interface:Well if it's going to delay yeah\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:but uh {vocalsound} it will be cool . It would . Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That would be cool . But eight months is really long\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker} Maybe we can just uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ten years {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . So um I I will uh {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker} so I we will move to next meeting so in {disfmarker} after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you {disfmarker} if you want but well the instruction will be sent . So thank you for uh your suggestion\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided . Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether . That would be easier .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:What is the folder that you put yours in ? And did it it did work ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager:No it did not work .\nMarketing:No no .\nProject Manager:She send it to me by email .\nUser Interface:Ah yeah . Mm .\nMarketing:I dunno , I dunno it .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So maybe this is better , to send it by email . Okay ?\nUser Interface:Okay what is your email ?\nProject Manager:So yeah I I'm {disfmarker} it's in the first uh email so I'm participant one at AMI\nUser Interface:At participant one . Okay .\nProject Manager:uh where is that , it's here . Participant one at AMI . {vocalsound} Okay . So see you after lunch break .\nUser Interface:Well during lunch break actually . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:'Kay thank you .\nUser Interface:So next time we should have a fight .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:How about uh {gap} management or something . Who happens to be your friend .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap}\n",
        "summary": "As an extension to the previous discussion, this meeting basically dealt with the functional design of the remote control, for which User Interface, Marketing and Industrial Design respectively gave presentations on user requirement specification, subjects' main frustrations and expectations for remote controls and technical design. Subsequent to individual presentations, Project Manager then presented the new requirements from the management board, based on which the decisions on the needed functions of the remote control were made and the pre-arrangement of the next meeting was subsequently told.",

        "conversations": "Professor B:OK So uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it 's visual but um got tables in front of us . Um what is {disfmarker} what does combo mean ?\nPhD C:So combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the MSG features . And so these low - pass filtered goes through M eh {disfmarker} another MLP and then the linear output of these two MLP 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this KLT . Um the output is used as uh features as well .\nProfessor B:Um so let me try to restate this and see if I have it right . There is uh {disfmarker} there is the features uh there 's the OGI features and then um those features um go through a contextual {disfmarker} uh l l let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow . Um those features go through a contextualized KLT . Then these features also uh get um low - pass filtered\nPhD C:Yeah . Yeah so yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard\nProfessor B:Sure . Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD D:The graph , yeah another one .\nProfessor B:Yeah , that 's good .\nPhD C:\nProfessor B:So\nPhD C:So we have these features from OGI that goes through the three paths .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Three , OK .\nPhD C:The first is a KLT using several frames of the features .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C:The second path is uh MLP also using nine frames {disfmarker} several frames of features\nProfessor B:Yeah . Uh - huh .\nPhD C:The third path is this low - pass filter .\nProfessor B:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:Uh , MLP\nProfessor B:Aha ! aha !\nPhD C:Adding the outputs just like in the second propose the {disfmarker} the proposal from {disfmarker} for the first evaluation .\nProfessor B:Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C:And then the KLT and then the two together again .\nProfessor B:No , the KLT . And those two together . That 's it .\nPhD D:Two HTK .\nProfessor B:OK so that 's {disfmarker} that 's this bottom one .\nPhD C:Um . So this is {disfmarker} yeah\nProfessor B:And so uh and then the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the one at the top {disfmarker} and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they 're the best ?\nPhD C:Yeah that 's the reason , yeah .\nProfessor B:Oh let 's focus on them then so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ?\nPhD C:For the f the f first yellow line you mean ?\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD C:Yeah so it 's uh basically s the same except that we don't have this uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams .\nPhD D:Step .\nPhD C:Well . There 's {disfmarker} there 's no low {disfmarker} low - pass processing used as additional feature stream .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:Um\nProfessor B:Do you e um they mentioned {disfmarker} made some {disfmarker} uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they {disfmarker} they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers .\nPhD C:Yeah . Uh actually the way things seems to um well it 's uh forty percent for TI - digit , sixty for all the SpeechDat - Cars , well all these languages . Ehm the well match is forty , medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty - five . Yeah .\nProfessor B:Um and we don't have the TI - digits part yet ?\nPhD C:Uh , no .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD C:But yeah . Generally what you observe with TI - digits is that the result are very close whatever the {disfmarker} the system .\nProfessor B:OK . And so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that ?\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:I mean not {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Uh not yet .\nProfessor B:OK so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good {disfmarker}\nPhD C:No . Mmm yeah , yeah .\nProfessor B:then we could compare the two and say what was better .\nPhD C:Mmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B:Um and how does this compare to the numbers {disfmarker} oh so OGI two is just the top {disfmarker} top row ?\nPhD D:Yeah .\nPhD C:So yeah to {disfmarker} actually OGI two is the {disfmarker} the baseline with the OGI features but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've {disfmarker} they 're still made some changes in the features\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD C:and {disfmarker} well but uh actually our results are better than their results . Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD C:Uh\nProfessor B:Uh OK so the one {disfmarker} one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian .\nPhD C:Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B:An\nPhD C:Yeah there is something funny happening here because {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD C:But there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are {disfmarker} we are {disfmarker} we are around forty - two and\nProfessor B:Now up\nPhD C:but\nProfessor B:Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a {disfmarker} a second um silence detection .\nPhD C:Yeah . So there are some results here\nPhD D:For the Italian .\nPhD C:uh so the third and the fifth line of the table\nPhD D:For this one .\nProfessor B:So filt is what that is ?\nPhD C:Filt , yeah\nPhD D:Yeah .\nPhD C:Um yeah so it seems f for the {disfmarker} the well match and mismatched condition it 's uh it brings something . Uh but uh actually apparently there are {disfmarker} there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay . Uh well\nProfessor B:Oh we can't do it . Oh OK .\nPhD C:No .\nPhD D:For that {disfmarker} for that we {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Oh .\nPhD C:Uh\nProfessor B:Too bad . Good idea , but can't do it .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD C:Except I don't know because they {disfmarker} I think they are still working well .\nProfessor B:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:Uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector so but yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side . Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and {disfmarker} but well hmm For the moment they have this large delay on the {disfmarker} the feature computation and so we don't\nProfessor B:OK . So Alright so for now at least that 's not there you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum doesn't have a huge effect but it {disfmarker} but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places .\nPhD C:I th\nProfessor B:Uh little bit .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Um and um um Yeah and uh let 's see What else did we have in there ? Uh I guess it makes a l um at this point this is I {disfmarker} I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh And you {disfmarker} you yellowed these out uh but uh uh Oh I see yeah that {disfmarker} that one you can't use because of the delay . Those look pretty good . Um let 's see that one Well even the {disfmarker} just the {disfmarker} the second row doesn't look that bad right ? That 's just uh yeah ?\nPhD C:Yep .\nProfessor B:And {disfmarker} and that looks like an interesting one too .\nPhD D:Mmm yeah .\nProfessor B:Uh\nPhD C:Actually the {disfmarker} yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow except that we don't have this KLT on the first {disfmarker} on the left part of the diagram . We just have the features as they are .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:Um\nProfessor B:Yeah . Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better . And it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a little {disfmarker} slightly simpler .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B:So {disfmarker} so there 's {disfmarker} so I {disfmarker} I would put that one also as a {disfmarker} as a maybe . Uh and it {disfmarker} yeah and it 's actually {vocalsound} does {disfmarker} does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched Italian , so s and little worse on the mis on the MM case , but uh Well yeah it 's worse than a few things\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:so uh let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their {disfmarker} their measure and {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are we running this uh for TI - digits or uh\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Now is TI di {disfmarker} is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development {disfmarker} th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of {disfmarker} end of the month , the TI - digits are there also ?\nPhD C:Yeah . Yeah . It 's included , yeah .\nProfessor B:Oh OK . OK . And see what else there is here . Um Oh I see {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker} I was looking down here at the {disfmarker} the o the row below the lower yellowed one . Uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh KLT size {disfmarker} reduced dimensionality .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm ? Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B:What happens there is it 's around the same and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps .\nPhD C:Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's significantly worse well but {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:It 's significantly worse {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh it 's {disfmarker} it 's mostly worse .\nPhD C:Exc - except for the HM\nPhD D:For many a mismatch it 's worse .\nPhD C:but\nProfessor B:Yeah . But it is little . I mean not {disfmarker} not by a huge amount , I don't know . What are {disfmarker} what are the sizes of any of these sets , I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten . So {disfmarker} you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ?\nPhD C:Uh\nPhD D:I don't remember .\nProfessor B:About ?\nPhD C:Um it 's {disfmarker} it depends {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} the well matched is generally larger than the other sets and I think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least .\nPhD D:Ye But words {disfmarker} well word {disfmarker} I don't know .\nPhD C:Hmm ? The words , yeah . S sentences .\nPhD D:Sentences .\nPhD C:Some sets have five hundred sentences , so .\nPhD D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:So the {disfmarker} so the sets {disfmarker} so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say\nPhD C:Mmm .\nProfessor B:and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it {disfmarker} most of them longer or\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD D:Yeah for the Italian even seven digits y more or less\nPhD C:It {disfmarker} it d Seven digits .\nPhD D:but sometime the sentence have only one digit and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm . Right , so between one and sixteen . See the {disfmarker} I mean the reason I 'm asking is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them , right ?\nPhD C:Mm - hmm ?\nProfessor B:So uh i if {disfmarker} if you had uh just you know {disfmarker} to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a {disfmarker} a tenth of a percent would just be one word ,\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:right ? So {disfmarker} so it wouldn't mean anything .\nPhD D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Oh\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:um so um yeah it be kind of {disfmarker} I 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD D:The size that we have ?\nPhD C:We could {disfmarker} we could run {disfmarker} run some kind of significance tests\nProfessor B:Yeah since these {disfmarker} well also just to know the numbers ,\nPhD C:or\nPhD D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:right . So these {disfmarker} these are word error rates\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:so this is on how many words .\nPhD C:Yep .\nPhD D:Yeah we have the result that the output of the HTK\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD D:The number of {disfmarker} of sentences , no it 's the number isn't .\nPhD C:Yeah sure {disfmarker} sure . Yeah sure .\nProfessor B:Yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that be great .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Um {vocalsound} what else is there here ? Um see the second {disfmarker} second from the bottom it says SIL , but this is some different kind of silence or thing or {disfmarker} what was that ?\nPhD C:Uh\nPhD D:It the {disfmarker} the output silence of the MLP .\nPhD C:Oh yeah I see .\nPhD D:It 's only one small experiment to know what happened . To apply also to in include also the {disfmarker} the silence of the MLP we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those .\nProfessor B:Yes . Uh - huh , uh - huh . The silence plus the KLT output ? Oh so you 're only using the silence .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD D:Yeah , because when we apply the KLT\nPhD C:No they 're {disfmarker} I think there is this silence in addition to the um KLT outputs\nProfessor B:No .\nPhD D:in addition , yes .\nPhD C:it is because we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we just keep uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the KLT\nPhD D:In addition t\nPhD C:and {disfmarker} yeah .\nPhD D:and we not s we are not sure if we pick {disfmarker} we have the silence .\nPhD C:So we try to add the silence also in addition to the {disfmarker} these twenty - eight dimensions .\nProfessor B:I see . OK . And what {disfmarker} and what 's OGI forty - five ? The bottom one there ?\nPhD C:Uh it 's o it 's OGI two , it 's {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th it 's the features from the first line\nPhD D:It 's in fact OGI two .\nProfessor B:S\nPhD C:and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor B:Right , but I mean what 's the {disfmarker} what does the last row mean ?\nPhD C:So it 's uh basically this but without the KLT on the {disfmarker} from the left path .\nProfessor B:I thought that was the one {disfmarker} I thought that was the second row . So what 's the difference between the second\nPhD C:Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just\nProfessor B:Oh .\nPhD C:uh\nProfessor B:So this is like the second line but with {disfmarker} with the combo stuff .\nPhD C:Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D:And with the {disfmarker} all the output of the combo .\nProfessor B:OK . Yeah .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD D:Uh\nProfessor B:OK , so {disfmarker} alright so it looks to me {disfmarker} I guess the same {disfmarker} given that we have to take the filt ones out of the {disfmarker} the running because of this delay problem {disfmarker} so it looks to me like the ones you said I agree are {disfmarker} are the ones to look at\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:but I just would add the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the second row one\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:and then um if we can um\nPhD C:Mmm .\nProfessor B:oh yeah also when {disfmarker} when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ? I guess it 's probably on the percentages right ?\nPhD C:Uh {vocalsound} I guess , yeah .\nProfessor B:Yeah OK .\nPhD C:I guess , yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor B:Alright .\nPhD C:It 's not clear here .\nProfessor B:OK . Maybe {disfmarker} maybe they 'll argue about it . Um OK so if we can know what {disfmarker} how many words are in each and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten {vocalsound} Friday\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:and then we 'll operate with that\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:and uh how long did it I guess if we 're not doing all these things {disfmarker} if we 're only doing um um I guess since this is development data it 's legitimate to do more than one , right ? I mean ordinarily if {disfmarker} in final test data you don't want to do several and {disfmarker} and take the best\nPhD C:Yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor B:that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's not proper but if this is development data we could still look at a couple .\nPhD C:Yeah . We can {disfmarker} yeah . Sure . But we have to decide {disfmarker} I mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best\nProfessor B:Yeah . I Right .\nPhD C:and these\nProfessor B:But the question is when {disfmarker} when do we fix the system ,\nPhD C:But we could\nProfessor B:do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday ?\nPhD C:it d\nProfessor B:I {disfmarker} Yeah , OK except that we do have to write it up .\nPhD C:I think we fixed on Tuesday , yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Also , so\nPhD C:Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B:Um\nPhD C:Uh yeah well . Well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some {disfmarker} some other @ @ .\nProfessor B:Right so maybe what we do is we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth\nPhD C:Yeah but Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:but we start the write - up right away because as you say there {disfmarker} there 's only minor differences between these .\nPhD C:I think you {disfmarker} we could {disfmarker} we could start soon , yeah .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD C:Write up something .\nProfessor B:Yeah , and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} you know , I would {disfmarker} I 'd kind of like to see it\nPhD C:Um yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:maybe I can {disfmarker} I can edit it a bit uh sure . The {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is English .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Uh so\nPhD C:Mmm .\nProfessor B:uh H yeah . Have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ?\nPhD C:Uh not really .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD C:Um There is the format of the table which is {vocalsound} quite impressive .\nProfessor B:Yeah ? Uh I see . Yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny . It 's all these little categories set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean . Uh No mitigation . Wow . Do you know what no {disfmarker} what no mitigation means here ?\nPhD C:Um it should be the the problem with the error {disfmarker} channel error\nProfessor B:Oh that 's probably the {disfmarker}\nPhD C:or\nProfessor B:this is probably channel error stuff\nPhD C:well , you {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:huh ? Oh this is i right , it says right above here channel {disfmarker} channel error resilience ,\nPhD C:Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor B:yeah . So recognition performance is just the top part , actually . Uh and they have {disfmarker} yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and {disfmarker} and evaluation .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:And {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} right , it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen . Multi - condition {disfmarker} multi - condition . So they have {disfmarker} looks like they have uh uh\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:so they splitting up between the TI - digits and everything else , I see . So the everything else is the SpeechDat - Car , that 's the multi multilingual\nPhD C:Yeah , so it 's not divided between languages you mean or {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Well , it is .\nPhD C:it just\nProfessor B:It is , but there 's also {disfmarker} there 's these tables over here for the {disfmarker} for the TI - digits and these tables over here for the car data which is {disfmarker} which is I guess all the multilingual stuff\nPhD C:Oh yeah .\nProfessor B:and then uh there 's {disfmarker} they also split up between multi - condition and clean only .\nPhD C:Yeah . For TI - digits .\nProfessor B:Yes .\nPhD C:Yeah , actually yeah . For the TI - digits they want to train on clean and on noisy\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD C:and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProfessor B:So we 're doing that also , I guess .\nPhD C:Uh yeah . But uh we actually {disfmarker} do we have the features ? Yeah . For the clean TI - digits but we did not test it yet . Uh the clean training stuff .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD C:Mmm .\nProfessor B:Well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to {vocalsound} work with our partners to fill out the tables {vocalsound} over the next uh next few days\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nPhD D:Yes .\nProfessor B:I guess they have to send it out {disfmarker} let 's see the thirty - first is uh uh Wednesday and I think the {disfmarker} it has to be there by some hour uh European time on Wednesday\nPhD C:Hmm - hmm .\nProfessor B:so {vocalsound} I think basically\nPhD D:We lost time uh Wednesday maybe because {vocalsound} that the difference in the time may be {disfmarker} is a long different of the time .\nProfessor B:E excuse me ?\nPhD D:Maybe the Thursday the twelfth of the night of the Thurs - thirty - one is {disfmarker} is not valid in Europe .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD D:We don't know is happening .\nProfessor B:Yes , so I mean {disfmarker} I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday\nPhD D:Tuesday .\nProfessor B:right because I {disfmarker} I think\nPhD C:Yeah , well .\nProfessor B:uh Uh\nPhD C:Except if {disfmarker} if it 's the thirty - one at midnight or I don't know {disfmarker} we can {vocalsound} still do some work on Wednesday morning .\nProfessor B:yeah well . W i is but is {disfmarker} is it midni I thought it was actually something like five PM on {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Yeah , well . Yeah .\nPhD D:Yeah .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:was like {disfmarker} I thought it was five PM or something , I didn't think it was midnight . I thought they said they wanted everything by\nPhD D:Yeah , five PM .\nProfessor B:well , so five PM their time is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} if\nPhD D:Not five PM , three PM .\nProfessor B:three PM .\nPhD D:Three PM .\nProfessor B:Alright , that 's six in the morning here .\nPhD C:It 's d no .\nPhD D:Uh no three {disfmarker} three A - three PM ?\nPhD C:No , we are wondering about the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the hour that we have to eh I don't know if it 's three PM {disfmarker} it 's\nPhD D:Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Three PM here is in Europe midnight .\nPhD C:Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's midnight but\nProfessor B:Yes , yes , but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due , I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five PM or something .\nPhD D:Oh OK . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , \nProfessor B:In which case\nPhD D:maybe .\nProfessor B:so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday . Um so then next Thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath\nPhD D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:but then {disfmarker} then we 'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:so all we 'll do is take whatever {vocalsound} they have and {disfmarker} and uh and run it through the process .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Uh we won't be changing the training on anything\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new HTK runs , so that 's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after {disfmarker} after Tuesday and {disfmarker} and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of uh the research .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately work on uh uh so\nPhD C:Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B:What ?\nGrad A:Oh , Stephane always has these great ideas and {disfmarker} oh , but uh we don't have time .\nPhD C:Sure .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD C:I 'm not sure these are great ideas .\nProfessor B:But they 're ideas . Yeah ? Oh , that was good .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:And {disfmarker} and uh also it 's still true that uh I think it 's true that {disfmarker} that we {disfmarker} we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features\nPhD C:But\nProfessor B:rather than uh in sequence which was {disfmarker} was your suggestion and that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that seems to have been borne out .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:The fact that none of these are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} you know , enormous is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is not too surprising {disfmarker} most improvements aren't enormous and {vocalsound} uh\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:some of them are but uh I mean you have something really really wrong {vocalsound} and you fix it {vocalsound} you can get big and really enormous improvements\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:but {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} um Cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs , but Anyway OK well I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there {disfmarker} is there anything else we should talk about or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} are we done ?\nPhD C:Mm - hmm . I think it 's OK um . We so basically we will {disfmarker} I think we 'll try to {disfmarker} to focus on these three architectures and {disfmarker} and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with just {disfmarker} just a single KLT because we did not really test that {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:removing all these KLT 's and putting one single KLT at the end .\nProfessor B:Yeah , I mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Uh if you can fit it in .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Oh I have {disfmarker} yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh I should tell people outside of this group too uh I don't know if we 're gonna need it uh but uh Jeff up at the uh University of Washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh IBM machines RS six thousands\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:and {disfmarker} and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or {disfmarker} I don't know , eight hundred megahertz or something and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti so if {disfmarker} you know he 's got a lot of processing power and um we 'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wanna {disfmarker} wanna {disfmarker} wanna run them he 's {disfmarker} he 's offering it .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:So . It 's uh when he was here eh uh he {disfmarker} he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell , so {disfmarker} so in some ways he just got his payback , but uh again I {disfmarker} I don't know if we 'll end up with {disfmarker} if we 're gonna be CPU limited on anything that we 're doing in this group\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:but {disfmarker} but if {disfmarker} if we are that 's an offer . OK well uh you guys doing great stuff so that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's really neat and uh we 'll uh uh g don't think we need to uh um Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say is that uh the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily is starting to get {disfmarker} are starting to get into a pretty good size collection and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now so that 's {disfmarker} that 's another source of data . Um which is s under somewhat better control and that we can {disfmarker} we can make measurements of the room the {disfmarker} uh that {disfmarker} you know if we feel there 's other measurements we don't have that we 'd like to have we can make them and uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago so uh that 's another {disfmarker} another possibility for this {disfmarker} this kind of work .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:K , uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do {disfmarker} do our digits {disfmarker} do our digits duty . OK . OK I 'll start . Uh , let me say that again . OK . I guess we 're done .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting participants discuss results from experiments and challenges that the model was facing. There was a significant server side delay, so they could not accommodate silence detection. Members noted that reducing model dimensions had a detrimental effect on model performance. The professor wanted to know the size of words that the word error rate was calculated on and explained that there would be no new training. From this point, they can start talking about future directions and work on fixing the system.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Hello , uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control .\nMarketing:Hello .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Hello .\nProject Manager:Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So , uh we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . So , who wants to start ? Okay .\nUser Interface:I s\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:No , no , you you can start .\nProject Manager:So start , uh\nMarketing:Okay , I'll start . Can you open my presentation ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:please .\nProject Manager:Uh . {gap}\nMarketing:I'm number four .\nProject Manager:This one ?\nMarketing:Trend . Yep . Can you pass the mouse , please . {vocalsound} Oh okay , that's fine .\nProject Manager:Turn .\nMarketing:Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you {disfmarker} present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . {vocalsound} From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . So , {vocalsound} I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .\nIndustrial Designer:What does it mean , spongy ?\nMarketing:Uh sort of um squishy .\nIndustrial Designer:Like soft , or something ?\nMarketing:Um . Yeah soft ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:like a uh like a sponge .\nProject Manager:Like a sponge . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I don't know . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . I will see .\nMarketing:Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . {vocalsound} Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our {disfmarker} of th the Real Reaction company . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , uh yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's it .\nProject Manager:Easy to use , is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . It's less important , right ?\nMarketing:Less important .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:So um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:and half important as technology is easy to use . So .\nProject Manager:{gap} So , Hamed , can you {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah . The second one . Could you please show the presentation number three .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um . Number ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We'll see .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Three .\nUser Interface:Three .\nProject Manager:This one ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes . {gap} Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . Uh , n n no , it's the first one . The second one .\nProject Manager:So it's not this one .\nUser Interface:Uh yeah . Okay . {gap} Okay . So I am going to talk about {disfmarker} a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um {vocalsound} generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be {disfmarker} we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . {vocalsound} Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can {disfmarker} which should be taken easily in hand . It should not be completely like uh a cube . It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier .\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly .\nUser Interface:And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control . I dunno if I can explain well . But uh just inside . For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . So it can be another uh preference . And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . Okay . That's mine .\nProject Manager:Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm person two . And which one , uh probably the first one . I'm not sure but check the first one . I {disfmarker} Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:This one , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's it . Just {disfmarker} It's only this slide ? Yeah . This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Inch .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , seven seven inch T_ {disfmarker} T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme .\nProject Manager:Oh , {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:This is this is the stuff that I can use to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oops .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so the {disfmarker} this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . So there will be some circuit uh for the power . So , say power circuit here . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh {disfmarker} And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So at least seven to seven . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It doesn't matter . Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . So this will be T_F_T_ . And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here . Interface to the microphone . Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So infra-red here . So the {disfmarker} once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be {disfmarker} which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . Um I have to check what I wanted to {disfmarker} Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device .\nProject Manager:Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes {disfmarker} if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe ,\nProject Manager:Okay . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno .\nUser Interface:Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .\nMarketing:So\nProject Manager:Okay . Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . {gap} maybe after .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Ca Can I ask a question . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:A Yeah , that's all from me .\nMarketing:This seven inch T_F_T_ screen ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nMarketing:how big is it in reality ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , seven to seven inches .\nMarketing:So like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's quite big .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?\nProject Manager:No , I don't think it's seven by seven ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think it's seven {disfmarker} the diagonal is seven .\nIndustrial Designer:To be honest , I was {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal .\nUser Interface:Yeah yes {gap} .\nMarketing:But I mean even even that is like this big .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} I dunno I dun I dun One each {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:. But , yeah , {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but it's seven inches . But I I think we can we can cut it .\nMarketing:You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Let's go . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , no no problem ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So let's cut the T_F_T_ .\nIndustrial Designer:So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So so for the same price we have four screens now {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:These technical engineers , huh .\nMarketing:So , what's the size of the device ?\nIndustrial Designer:Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .\nMarketing:Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .\nMarketing:Is it {disfmarker} Can you hold that , or ?\nIndustrial Designer:Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} What user wants . He wants a small remote control , or ? Uh uh with big buttons .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .\nMarketing:Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand .\nProject Manager:It's difficult .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} A sm\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow {disfmarker} Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So maybe you can finish your presentation ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and afterwards we will discuss about all this .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} Oh , okay .\nUser Interface:Maybe this {gap} .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay thanks {gap} .\nProject Manager:That's it . Okay . So . {vocalsound} {gap} No . Uh , so I think we have a lot {disfmarker} We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ?\nIndustrial Designer:Not {disfmarker} J uh just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so no problem in energy , I think .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But we have to use the solar cell .\nUser Interface:So but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Otherwise not .\nProject Manager:but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh one two {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So like three to five centimetres ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno exactly , but .\nMarketing:So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?\nIndustrial Designer:S Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:The television lights . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah from the T_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think it's enough , uh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I dunno .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:At least it's new and maybe technology New technology .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things .\nMarketing:It's it's quite innovative , yes .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:And if you watch T_V_ outside it's {vocalsound} very useful . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other {disfmarker} what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ?\nUser Interface:Mm . I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . So let's say an average size , okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:and it should not be very heavy also . And I prefer to {disfmarker} is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . So we c it's like like some joysticks . You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . So uh seven {disfmarker} not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's {disfmarker} that's my opinion . It's easier .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Which is the same area .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Could you re could you redesign your board ?\nIndustrial Designer:Five to ten . Well that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , right .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one um um {disfmarker} How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . Well {disfmarker} But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit .\nProject Manager:Oh . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible .\nIndustrial Designer:Well fi five to ten it would be feasible .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible .\nProject Manager:Okay . So we are agree with a small\nIndustrial Designer:I'll make it .\nUser Interface:{gap} Or uh or I don't know\nProject Manager:L_C_D_ . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Fo Five by ten .\nUser Interface:but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Touching the screen . Something like\nProject Manager:Tactile or something , yeah .\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} Mm like tactile .\nMarketing:Mm , touch screen .\nProject Manager:Touch screen , yeah .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So let's go for a small L_C_D_ .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me\nUser Interface:A smaller s\nProject Manager:Yeah okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So , five by s ten .\nIndustrial Designer:and I will work it out .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Um so what about , so the case we talked about . Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the {disfmarker} it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Seven to ten banana .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} A big banana . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Rather mango or something or .\nProject Manager:Um . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I dunno if it can fit with the technology . You are the specialists of that .\nIndustrial Designer:You mean banana .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , but {disfmarker} If it's {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If it {disfmarker} If the banana is big enough .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Then , yes . {vocalsound} But if you want to look at the screen {gap} , no . Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , and\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think this {gap} is not good . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The screen has to be {vocalsound} square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , it can be whatever you want .\nProject Manager:It could . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement .\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker} I'd like a shaped screen . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen .\nProject Manager:Okay\nIndustrial Designer:Okay {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not {disfmarker} doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Like modified banana , okay .\nProject Manager:So we are agree with the banana thing ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well it {disfmarker} we'll stick to banana , or ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , banana's good .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-mm .\nProject Manager:So , {gap} the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think infra-red .\nProject Manager:Everybody's agreed .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . Sure .\nProject Manager:Uh , so that's it I think about the concepts . You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . I don't know what we are going to do with that . You talked about the buttons on the side {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Like like peeling of the banana you s {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , peeling of the banana .\nProject Manager:Mm what ?\nIndustrial Designer:It would be cool , yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Peeling of the banana , you know ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . And you mean the first layer would be spongy .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} First layer obviously spo Yeah ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think .\nProject Manager:Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ?\nUser Interface:Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it .\nMarketing:I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , some {disfmarker} Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . So , something like this . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .\nIndustrial Designer:Well is it possible to make it soft ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So I think if it's so then it's cool ?\nProject Manager:So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .\nMarketing:I think for sure . Definitely . The softer the better .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Cool .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but it will be terrible . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um . And setting buttons hidden in {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm , other remarks , or something , or . Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . I think we are almost there {gap} . Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And how {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Pof .\nMarketing:We could use Velcro .\nProject Manager:Yeah , maybe .\nMarketing:Or uh ma maybe a magnetic\nUser Interface:Yes , yeah {gap} it's a good idea .\nMarketing:thing .\nProject Manager:Ma magnetic {gap} oh .\nUser Interface:Magnetic {gap} . Mm . Yeah or a {disfmarker} Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh {vocalsound} materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana .\nProject Manager:Okay . And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . Maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b uh {disfmarker} So we need that the that the peeling {disfmarker} uh I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So that we can reach the energy out of it {disfmarker} out of that .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and\nIndustrial Designer:It is possible , but , well if it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And a and a banana .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But then it must be some window there , you know .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:And something we forgot , maybe , uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes , I think . I think so .\nMarketing:I think it's important .\nProject Manager:It i Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great .\nMarketing:I think {disfmarker} One of our p priorities is tech technology .\nProject Manager:So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:And {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and we have also the technology thing w will be . And even the easy to use thing ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so it will be perfect .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:So we add also the speech recognition device .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I agree .\nProject Manager:So , that great . We have decided everything . And think we are on a good way . So , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And uh , yeah , I uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , and uh more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together . And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . So thank you all everybody ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:and see you in thirty minutes .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Thank you .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting was mainly about the conceptual design of the remote control. Firstly, marketing introduced market research and fashion trends around the world. While the user interface emphasized that easy to use was more important. Then the industrial designer talked about the overall requirements from the engineering point of view, including the size of the device and source of energy. The group members spent time figuring out the real size of the TFT screen and energy problem. After that, they discussed the shape of the remote control and decided to make it like a banana. Based on this shape, they talked about the detailed design of the appearance and user interface.",

        "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. Can I ask if Members have any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're very much looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking about the fact that 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people.\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, we're very confident. I mean, it has to, quite clearly. We do need to think about the present generation, the problems faced by the current generation. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults\u2014we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues\u2014diabetes is often cited\u2014cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. We've been visiting a number of schools during the consultation process. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. Obviously, we're hopeful that schools and young people will contribute to the consultation as well. So, we've had quite good input, I would say, from children and young people. There is always more we can do we and we want to hear those voices.\nNathan Cook:I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already.\nLynne Neagle AM:And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Good morning. I'll be speaking in Welsh. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed?\nDr Frank Atherton:My advice was not that we don't need a target\u2014we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. We need a challenging environment. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?'\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. So, to be clear, you're not ruling out that maybe we would need a target.\nDr Frank Atherton:It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And is that your opinion too?\nNathan Cook:Yes.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there?\nDr Frank Atherton:I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process\u2014and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn\u2014we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions\u2014that's the point we need to consult on.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. And the other point, of course, is the investment. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan?\nDr Frank Atherton:Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. So, the question of resourcing is important. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. We need to look at existing programmes, how effective they are. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy.\nNathan Cook:But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And does the level of investment depend on what the target is\u2014what the goal is?\nDr Frank Atherton:I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place.\nSian Gwenllian AM:But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for?\nDr Frank Atherton:Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. We need proper evaluation of the various programmes that we have.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to\u2014?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. But to your question:\u00a0should we use the funding? Well, of course we should use funding. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. There are, of course, a number of initiatives that we currently fund through the general revenue. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the \u00a37 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular.\nSian Gwenllian AM:You're saying that it's less than expected. Could you give us any kind of figure?\nDr Frank Atherton:I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?\nSian Gwenllian AM:You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure?\nDr Frank Atherton:The figure that I have in mind is about \u00a356 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. But I'd have to confirm that with the committee. What the anticipated\u2014. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, I mean, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. Nathan may have some precise figures.\nNathan Cook:Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised \u00a3150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was \u00a3520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential\u2014\u00a3150 million.\nNathan Cook:On a UK level.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential?\nLynne Neagle AM:Fifty-six.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Fifty-six? Gosh, that sounds a lot. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme.\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing.\nLynne Neagle AM:Can I just ask on that before Si\u00e2n moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to\u2014? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that?\nDr Frank Atherton:I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from\u2014. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about\u2014?\nLynne Neagle AM:Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things.\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, that cuts to what I was talking about. My preference\u2014it's a personal view\u2014is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. I mean, what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention.\nLynne Neagle AM:No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM:I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying, 'Here's a sugar levy', and 'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.' Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful.\nDr Frank Atherton:You may be right. I'm not a behavioural psychologist. We'd have to ask\u2014\nSuzy Davies AM:Neither am I. I'm a person who eats a lot of sugar. [Laughter.]\nDr Frank Atherton:Your point's taken.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thanks. Si\u00e2n.\nSian Gwenllian AM:The last question from me, about partnership working. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that?\nDr Frank Atherton:It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. I'm not interested in producing a strategy that sits on a shelf. If you look around the world, there are plenty of obesity strategies. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. We need political commitment to this, and that's why I welcome the input from this committee. So, that needs to be assured. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. So we need to think about our governance system for this and how we drive it forward. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see\u2014and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you, Chair. Delivery of the plan will be led by a national implementation board that will be accountable to Ministers. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister?\nDr Frank Atherton:Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. That's our main source of information. If we look at that data, it shows us\u2014. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that?\nDr Frank Atherton:The last survey was just last year.\nNathan Cook:The data was published last week.\nDr Frank Atherton:Yes, the lastest data was out last week.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:It is pretty up to date.\nDr Frank Atherton:So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows\u2014. It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:It is shocking.\nDr Frank Atherton:So, that's our main source of information. Does that answer your question?\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that I mean in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier.\nNathan Cook:And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. That's going to be\u2014. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. You've answered my next question. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data?\nDr Frank Atherton:I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on healthy environments from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation?\nDr Frank Atherton:It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. As to your question of legislative time, I'm not really in a position to answer that. What I could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation. There may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all.\nDawn Bowden AM:Sure, I understand that, that you could do other things. I know\u2014. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that?\nDr Frank Atherton:I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. It's an interesting one. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. There may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation. The specific question around takeaways, particularly takeaways near schools, is often asked. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. I understand London is now\u2014some London boroughs are now\u2014experimenting with that as well. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes.\nDawn Bowden AM:Sure, because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. It goes\u2014. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. Thank you. And widening it out to other public services buildings as well.\nDr Frank Atherton:Indeed.\nDawn Bowden AM:Yes. Okay. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about how we create healthy settings. I've got some questions from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you very much. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity.\u00a0I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and\u2014.\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. As to healthy preschools, I don't know, Nathan may have some view on that. I've not been closely involved with the work. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we\u2014enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours\u2014that's exactly why we need the consultation.\nNathan Cook:But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having\u2014you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. Thank you. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right\u2014obviously, parents have a role in this, or families\u2014there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum.\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, I'd certainly be delighted to\u00a0take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. It's certainly a point we can try and look at.\nSuzy Davies AM:Because we will want to know who to ask: 'you're the accountable person\u2014why has something worked, or not worked?' We will need to know that at some point.\nDr Frank Atherton:Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools\u2014I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented\u2014the school came and some of the children came and presented\u2014to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was, 'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay, well, thank you for that commitment anyway.\nLynne Neagle AM:And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce\u2014education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old\u2014. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one?\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today.\nDr Frank Atherton:I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours?\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay, thank you. I'll leave some questions for Hefin.\nLynne Neagle AM:Hefin.\nHefin David AM:Is that all right, Chair?\nLynne Neagle AM:You've got the floor, Hefin.\nHefin David AM:Thank you, Chair. You make a commitment to embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education. What would that look like?\nDr Frank Atherton:Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It doesn't actually have as much of an impact on weight as the dietary issue. I'd just say that. It's really important for all sorts of reasons. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. So\u2014I'm sorry, I've lost track of your question.\nNathan Cook:I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales\u2014we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well.\nHefin David AM:With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. I hated it. I didn't feel engaged with it. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team\u2014I wanted to get that in. The school sports survey, that would suggest that we're still not hitting those targets with children. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that\u2014? I felt completely alienated in school.\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. So, there are specific moments that we need to understand. We do have a lot of information about these kinds of things. Public Health Wales is very good at collating the information. We do need to turn that into programmes. I mean, at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences.\nHefin David AM:Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. That could be quite a wide and varied range of things. Is that the key?\nDawn Bowden AM:It's not all about organised team sports.\nHefin David AM:Yes. As Dawn said, it's not just about organised team sports. There are some very individual activities you could do.\nDr Frank Atherton:Absolutely, yes. And that's where I think\u2014. I'm delighted that Sport Wales has moved beyond. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity.\nHefin David AM:So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education?\nDr Frank Atherton:Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. It may well be that that is something that could be considered.\nHefin David AM:Okay. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils?\nDr Frank Atherton:I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. I think it's the quality of the food that we need to focus on. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a\u2014\nHefin David AM:So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet.\nDr Frank Atherton:I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer.\nHefin David AM:But you don't necessarily think universal provision would\u2014.\nDr Frank Atherton:I don't have a clear view on that. I know there's a larger debate about that.\nHefin David AM:Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:I've got some supplementaries from Janet and then Suzy.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Yes. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. However, there's probably only a third having school meals; the rest are packed lunches. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is\u2014. Me, personally, I'd love to see the introduction of universal school meals. I think it's been a very retrograde step, going backwards. Would you be willing to carry out any research?\nDr Frank Atherton:So, I mean, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember\u2014? You must have seen on tv\u2014I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales\u2014parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. We don't need to get into that. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. And you can reward children, and children do respond to rewards. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. But I think just banning chocolate bars and crisps in the packed lunch is unlikely to be successful.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:We can't do that. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools?\nDr Frank Atherton:Yes. That gets you back to the question about universal school meals.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Perhaps some of that \u00a356 million sugar tax, even. Who knows?\nLynne Neagle AM:Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes. Mine is just a short question. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations\u2014the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer?\nNathan Cook:It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it.\nSuzy Davies AM:All right. So, it's very pertinent to Janet's question, in that way. Okay, so it's mainly about sugar, but it could be about other things as well. Okay. Thanks.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. The next questions are from Janet anyway; firstly, on the clinical obesity pathway.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:The 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people?\nDr Frank Atherton:We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. I'm not sure of exactly the time frame that we have given them for that.\nNathan Cook:We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. So, we'll be looking probably early autumn for them to report back on that.\nDr Frank Atherton:The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, I mean, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have\u2014and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we\u2014the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. There are programmes available, but they're perhaps not universally provided. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. It lists existing initiatives, such as the Healthy Child Wales programme and breastfeeding action plan. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We're currently looking at breastfeeding because it starts before birth, actually. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. So, we do need to go further on that. We do have some programmes\u2014Healthy Working Wales, et cetera\u2014that need to be improved. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far.\nNathan Cook:Can I just say\u2014? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. There is something about the affordability of good-quality healthy food that we need to think about. We do need to think in broad terms\u2014broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms\u2014about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind\u2014I'm a public health professional\u2014and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. So, you speak to a very deep question there. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation?\nDr Frank Atherton:Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. So, the health system obviously needs to respond to this issue. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about, 'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?' That's true for adults and it's true for children as well.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. We appreciate your time. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy in due course, but thank you again.\nDr Frank Atherton:We'll do that. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you very much. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee on CAMHS tier 4 provision.

        "summary": "The meeting with Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government, was mainly about the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' draft strategy in Wales and subsequent questions about it. To start with, Sian Gwenllian AM proposed questions like the strategy's evaluation, investment and principal. Dr Frank Atherton, at the same time, indicated that there was a n exact evaluation and the nation has already imposed tax on sugar and the first Minister will definitely be the ultimate man at the wheel. Then they paid much attention to existing data measuring child obesity and decided to put it in great use in tackling obesity. Meanwhile, the meeting talked about government legislation for some sort of things like restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and sports infrastructure in schools as part of efforts to make a healthy environment. What's more, they went into details on how healthy settings constructions and whom that would be the one to take responsibility. Also, they had a discussion on physical education and school meals for pupils. Finally, the meeting participants gave some supplements of education and the draft strategy and the chair concluded the meeting with the future universality of the draft strategy.",

Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer {vocalsound} that uh looks would be very important on this new remote\nUser Interface:Designer . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . Um . {vocalsound} Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And she was challenged on that point {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} that's right . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . The industrial designer um presented her uh {vocalsound} thoughts on the issue . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . Uh and of course a circuit board . And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse {disfmarker} morse code related relays the {disfmarker} uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:She would like uh {disfmarker} this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with {disfmarker} to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . She feels that's really what people want today . And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes {disfmarker} from the last meeting . Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Just the look like , the button part I'll explain .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh so this is our {disfmarker} what uh we have made . This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:um and it's {disfmarker} it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so it is a {disfmarker} uh uh a {disfmarker} looks-wise it is beautiful .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh and also compact in shape .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into {disfmarker} into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:oops , sorry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You used to have all the buttons {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the {disfmarker} Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als\nMarketing:Oh that's good ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:no , that's nice and friendly .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And then um uh for the {disfmarker} for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and it's a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker} and the button {disfmarker} button's part uh will be explained by F Francina .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Now the um {disfmarker} we decided upon including certain features on our remote . Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal {disfmarker} it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm ,\nMarketing:Yeah , okay , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Now uh we have included the switch on and off button .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Now we have included another feature that is the mute button\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:on the side of the model . Then we have included one to nine buttons\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:for controlling the programmes {disfmarker} the different channels .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . Now our {disfmarker} our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:What kind of button ?\nUser Interface:Menu button .\nProject Manager:Menu ? Uh menu th menu , uh one one .\nUser Interface:Yes , menu {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Menu button . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:At the centre\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:of this uh picture . We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .\nMarketing:The next channel in the numeric pattern , or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No , swapping is if if example you're {disfmarker} you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .\nMarketing:Yeah , mm-hmm . Mm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Okay , okay .\nUser Interface:And at the end , it {disfmarker} this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly .\nProject Manager:Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So this is our proposed model .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Now the marketing expert has to\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Tell , yeah .\nUser Interface:give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable {vocalsound} or it'll be cost effective .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , well um what {disfmarker} what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb ,\nUser Interface:Yes , yes .\nMarketing:that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ?\nProject Manager:Yes the buttons are all raised , right ?\nMarketing:The buttons are all raised\nProject Manager:Are raised , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down ,\nProject Manager:Right . Or have two hands to operate it , yeah .\nMarketing:I really like that .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:You really did a good job on that , my little designers .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . That's that's a really good good thing .\nProject Manager:Yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , that's great .\nProject Manager:you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Abs okay .\nMarketing:The colour's very attractive . Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute\nUser Interface:No , these {disfmarker} the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .\nMarketing:and {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} mm-hmm On both sides they're mute ?\nUser Interface:Yes , yes .\nMarketing:So you can push either one ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter .\nMarketing:And this brings the menu up on the screen ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Pardon me ? This is the menu {disfmarker} yes , yes .\nMarketing:This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:A the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels .\nMarketing:F f okay .\nUser Interface:Scroll up or scroll down the channels .\nMarketing:Right , very good . Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay and now I'm supposed to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , I have one question\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?\nUser Interface:Yes , it will have uh {disfmarker} these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah . Yeah , definitely .\nProject Manager:Will have symbols so that that {disfmarker} that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yes , which can be easily recognised .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah of course , and also {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah we can {disfmarker} Text .\nMarketing:Symbols on it . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Text that we can have on the case itself ,\nProject Manager:That's right .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:we can {disfmarker} it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And {disfmarker} and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .\nMarketing:Mm , 'kay , mm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:A shell shape .\nMarketing:For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm ,\nProject Manager:Right , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So it is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} we have the snail shell .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes , snail shell .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah ,\nMarketing:He goes right back into his shell .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah {disfmarker} shell .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Y Yes {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , of course , yeah .\nMarketing:you know that would , that would really work .\nProject Manager:Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think voice recognition is our big selling point\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use .\nMarketing:Yep\nProject Manager:You know .\nMarketing:uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance .\nProject Manager:Colours . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:We're really gonna have the be the\nProject Manager:Cutest .\nMarketing:cutest remote control on the block .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I think those are the two things to push . The look and the voice recognition . They're gonna be our two selling points .\nProject Manager:Okay , now uh having said that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ?\nProject Manager:No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Now we're gonna talk about financing . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well , there is a production evaluation .\nMarketing:No ?\nProject Manager:Is that you ?\nMarketing:Yeah , that's me .\nProject Manager:But that's after the financing .\nMarketing:Oh , okay .\nProject Manager:See ? Fi see ?\nMarketing:Sorry , sorry . Mm-mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um . {vocalsound} Okay , we had looks and voice recognition . Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . Okay uh energy source we say that's battery , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:That's right .\nProject Manager:Okay , now . So we {disfmarker} I guess we use one .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:What ? T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . Well , that's nice . She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would {disfmarker} It doesn't work . Hmm .\nMarketing:Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh , okay yeah , okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:let's see . Okay , one , okay .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Oh go away . Um kinetic source so that's {disfmarker} in the energy source that's all we need .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Uh electronics , simple chip on print ? Is that's what we're using ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:One of those ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:Come on . Okay , one . Uh regular chip on print . No . That's all we need , the one\nIndustrial Designer:No . Yeah .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .\nMarketing:Well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:This is a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Single curve ? Mm .\nMarketing:I guess it's double curved .\nProject Manager:Double curved ? One of those ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Case materi s supplements . Plastic we said , right ?\nUser Interface:Plastic .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh wood , rubber ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons .\nProject Manager:Uh but , yes but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh {disfmarker} yeah case material .\nProject Manager:That's just for the case material ,\nUser Interface:Is this for the case ? Yes .\nProject Manager:so special colours though , we having that ,\nMarketing:Oh okay , the mm-hmm , mm' kay .\nProject Manager:right ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And then we have to interface push buttons .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Scroll wheel , no . Integrated scroll wheel , L_C_ display ?\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:No ,\nProject Manager:Button .\nMarketing:'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , right ?\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Uh , button supplement special colour ?\nUser Interface:Speci Yes\nProject Manager:Special form ?\nUser Interface:Yes d we do have special form .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:And special material , rubber , wood , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Total seven point six whatever that means .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , I think that's the price .\nProject Manager:That's the price .\nUser Interface:One two three four five six seven eight nine\nProject Manager:Mm ?\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe it {disfmarker} is it just {disfmarker} n\nProject Manager:Eight , eight point two . That's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Nine points ,\nProject Manager:hmm ?\nUser Interface:okay , yes .\nProject Manager:Eight point two , right ? So , we {disfmarker} looks like we are well within budget .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . I guess I should save this I suppose , huh ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oops . Uh-huh huh huh .\nUser Interface:On the desktop .\nProject Manager:I just tried that . My documents , computer .\nIndustrial Designer:AMI .\nProject Manager:My compu Ah oh here it is , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:AMI should for\nProject Manager:Okay , fine . Save . Okay good , so that's the good news . We gonna be popular .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um . So that uh {disfmarker} I think financing was pretty simple .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .\nMarketing:Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up . 'Kay should be able to get it now . 'Kay , why don't you move just to the next slide right away .\nProject Manager:You wanna go to the next slide ?\nMarketing:Yeah right away .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that {disfmarker} maybe little things we haven't thought of .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing:So we have to get some input from those people .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . Um , next slide please . Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . The size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store .\nUser Interface:Fee selling .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um so they'll be our main selling points . So um {vocalsound} th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . Okay , so um the shape um I think is a {disfmarker} a one . That's really , really excellent shape . The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's {disfmarker} I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right {disfmarker} the scale is one to seven . I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:And our colour I think is great . The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it .\nProject Manager:Um I just realised one thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .\nMarketing:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .\nMarketing:Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ?\nProject Manager:Eight , eight twenty , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Eight twenty so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And so we've got {disfmarker} we've still got four euros to go {disfmarker} to spend .\nIndustrial Designer:We have um four euros , yeah\nProject Manager:I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean {vocalsound} four thirty .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Well um that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So um we just have to beware of that . I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {gap} .\nMarketing:So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yes , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , still .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no {disfmarker} that that was not um included uh {disfmarker} that there was no room for any special features , okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Included , yeah . Hmm ,\nUser Interface:Yeah mm .\nIndustrial Designer:hmm\nProject Manager:So to beware of that . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?\nMarketing:Uh , well I isn't this my last slide ?\nProject Manager:I dunno .\nMarketing:Maybe .\nProject Manager:Yes it is . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Go ahead . I think that was my last slide , yeah . Um . Mm okay . And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nMarketing:I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that , um .\nProject Manager:Why ? Wh why you need that up ?\nMarketing:Hmm ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there . {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here .\nProject Manager:I think you can make it there .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay . You ready . So now we're all supposed to say what we think . Um okay so on shape I gave it a one . Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst .\nUser Interface:Worse , okay .\nMarketing:Um what do you think the shape is ?\nUser Interface:One .\nMarketing:One , okay , and Be Betsy ?\nProject Manager:Yes I think uh shape is one .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , even my {disfmarker} yeah , shape is one .\nMarketing:Okay , uh-huh one , okay . And how about on size ? On size {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You {disfmarker} you gave it a four .\nMarketing:I gave it a four , yeah , I feel it's just average .\nProject Manager:Um , I dunno . I think I would give it at least a two .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:One .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , even I think it is one . It's quite small .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um and then how about {disfmarker} how we doing on colour ?\nProject Manager:Colour uh I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Colour , I gave it a one .\nProject Manager:One .\nMarketing:I really like all those nice bright , warm colours .\nProject Manager:I {disfmarker} I like the colours . One .\nUser Interface:One . Yes .\nMarketing:One .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , one .\nMarketing:One , one , one , okay . And how about the feel ? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand .\nProject Manager:Uh , I think I would give it a two .\nMarketing:Okay , I gave it a three , two ,\nUser Interface:I'll give three .\nMarketing:yeah ? Three .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh maybe two ,\nMarketing:Two , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} are more tangible so from that point of view\nMarketing:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but um {disfmarker} I'll give it a three .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Two .\nMarketing:Two , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh three , mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Three ? Okay . Well , um . It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} But um otherwise I think we're {disfmarker} we're ready to go to {disfmarker} go with this product . Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?\nProject Manager:Uh . Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . Um . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ?\nUser Interface:We can always improve , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we can {disfmarker} yeah , include some more buttons and uh um\nUser Interface:Yes , features .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah features . We can make the buttons {disfmarker} few buttons smaller . Uh I think they are quite big , so I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Well then again if we're gonna um {vocalsound} do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , definitely .\nUser Interface:Yes . Voices .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So that that's where we're gonna have to do {disfmarker} maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons .\nUser Interface:Yes . Yes .\nMarketing:And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control . Maybe we can put that all on one button .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .\nProject Manager:Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And maybe {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . No .\nProject Manager:Uh um we need uh {disfmarker} you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? Uh I think {disfmarker} personally I think uh I'm pretty happy .\nMarketing:I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um ,\nProject Manager:Um an\nIndustrial Designer:Even I'm happy .\nMarketing:it's something I think I can market . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes , yes you've done a good job .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , definitely . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And I think team work I think was very very good , I think we really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And uh I think we {disfmarker} are we happy with the means we used ? We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things .\nMarketing:Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah ,\nUser Interface:Whiteboard more , yes , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , probably .\nMarketing:we didn't use that enough .\nProject Manager:Yes , we could . Uh , it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:And we used the slide because it was better positioned .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes , I think so , I think absolutely ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:Mm I think that's true mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Um did we new {disfmarker} did we find new ideas ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I think we did .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , many .\nMarketing:I think we were we were very good , yeah , mm .\nProject Manager:I think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Are the costs within budget ? Yes , yes . Uh is the project evaluated ? Yes .\nMarketing:Yes , yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um then celebration . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Celebration .\nUser Interface:Cel celebration {vocalsound} yes , yes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So I {disfmarker} I thank you all very much . Um , I think this was very good and um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible . Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So , thank you .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you very much .\nMarketing:Okay . Watch I I have my cord behind you here .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:I always get it on here , but getting it off is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Do we {disfmarker} do we have some time left ? Uh {disfmarker} you have {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:They say it's forty minutes .\nProject Manager:Ah yes we have time later\nMarketing:But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .\nProject Manager:but we don't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , alright .\nMarketing:It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . {vocalsound} Oh , there we go .\n",
        "summary": "Project Manager first recapped the previous meeting, concluding that the remote should be compact, user-friendly and could function like speech recognition. Next, the presentation of the bright blue snail shaped prototype was made by Industrial Designer and User Interface, introducing the appearance and features of the remote. Then, feedback was given regarding the prototype, which was mainly positive and speech recognition and cute appearance were decided as its star feature. Afterwards, the team discussed the financing of the remote, which should be within the budget of twelve fifty euros. Finally, the meeting ended with a project evaluation, which everyone was satisfied with the product and dynamic of the team, and team building.",

        "conversations": "PhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Um , so . If we can't , we can't . But uh we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the {disfmarker} the next {disfmarker} next occupants were pushing for it , so . Um . So . Agenda is {disfmarker} according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and\nGrad H:Does anyone have anything to {pause} add to the agenda ?\nProfessor B:OK . Should we just go in order ? Transcription status ? Who 's {disfmarker} that 's probably you .\nPostdoc A:I can do that quickly . Um I hired several more transcribers , They 're making great progress .\nProfessor B:Seven ?\nPostdoc A:Seve - several , several .\nProfessor B:Oh .\nPostdoc A:And uh {disfmarker} and uh , uh I 've been uh finishing up the uh double checking . I hoped to have had that done by today but it 's gonna take one more week .\nGrad H:Um\nPhD D:I g\nGrad H:as a somewhat segue into the next topic , um could I get a hold of uh the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ?\nPostdoc A:Certainly . Yeah I mean , it 's in the same place it 's been .\nGrad H:So can you just {disfmarker} Oh , it is .\nPostdoc A:Uh - huh . No change .\nGrad H:OK . Just {disfmarker} So , \" transcripts \" is the sub - directory ?\nPostdoc A:Uh {disfmarker} Yes . Uh - huh .\nGrad H:OK . So I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there .\nPostdoc A:OK .\nGrad H:Um and then just {disfmarker} we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made .\nPostdoc A:OK .\nProfessor B:OK , wh\nPhD D:I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've uh just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would {disfmarker} they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them .\nGrad C:Cool .\nPhD F:Well the second one of those\nPhD D:Yep . It 's already at IBM ,\nPhD F:is already at IBM .\nPhD D:but the other ones {disfmarker}\nPhD F:That 's the one that {pause} we 're waiting to hear from them on .\nPhD D:Yeah . Yeah .\nPostdoc A:OK .\nPhD F:Yeah .\nPostdoc A:These are separate from the ones that {disfmarker}\nPhD F:As soon as {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:I mean , these are {disfmarker}\nPhD F:They 're the IBM set .\nPhD D:Yep .\nGrad H:It 's this one .\nPostdoc A:Excellent . Good .\nPhD F:Yeah . And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK\nGrad H:Is my mike on ? Yeah .\nPhD F:and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then uh we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch ,\nPostdoc A:Excellent .\nPhD F:and let them work on that .\nGrad H:And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ?\nPhD F:Yes , exactly .\nGrad H:OK , good .\nPhD F:We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once .\nGrad H:Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it ,\nPhD F:Yeah .\nGrad H:especially for the information retrieval stuff . Anything else on transcription status ?\nPostdoc A:Hm - mmm .\nGrad H:OK .\nProfessor B:DARPA demos , we had the submeeting the other day .\nGrad H:Right , which uh {disfmarker} So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are {disfmarker} there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . And so I 've written some tools to convert everything into the right for file formats . And the command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for uh conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do {disfmarker} type in a {disfmarker} a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting ,\nPhD F:What {disfmarker} what kind of uh {disfmarker} what does that look like ? The string that you type in .\nGrad H:uh of hits .\nPhD F:What are you {disfmarker} are you {disfmarker} are they keywords , or are they {disfmarker} ?\nGrad H:Keywords .\nPhD F:OK . I see .\nGrad H:Right ? And so {disfmarker} and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything .\nPhD F:I see .\nProfessor B:And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ?\nGrad H:Um , right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools ,\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . Um the SoftSound guys did a web - based one ,\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:um , which I haven't used , haven't looked at . Dan says it 's pretty good\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:but it does mean you need to be running a web server .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:And so it {disfmarker} it 's pretty big and complex . Uh and it would be difficult to port to Windows because it means porting the web server to Windows .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:which I think looks great . I think that 's a nice demo . Um and that would be much easier to port to Windows . And so I think that 's the way we should go .\nPostdoc A:I {disfmarker} Can I ask a question ? So um as it stands within the {disfmarker} the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play .\nGrad H:Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc A:You can find a searched string and play . So e Are you {disfmarker} So you 're adding like um , I don't know , uh are they fuzzy matches or are they {pause} uh {disfmarker} ?\nGrad H:It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based {disfmarker} So it 's uh term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring .\nPostdoc A:OK .\nGrad H:Um and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it {disfmarker} it 's\nPostdoc A:It 's a lot more sophisticated than the uh the basically Windows - based {disfmarker}\nGrad H:i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that .\nPostdoc A:OK .\nGrad H:So i it uses {disfmarker} So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't {disfmarker} you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do {disfmarker} wouldn't wanna do a search .\nPostdoc A:Hm - mmm . Good .\nGrad H:Um you have to do preindexing and so that {disfmarker} these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} uh to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD G:Mm - hmm .\nPhD F:So what does the user see as the result of the query ?\nGrad H:On which tool ?\nPhD F:THISL .\nGrad H:The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK\nPhD F:Yeah .\nGrad H:um you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . Click on them rather {comment} with a mouse .\nPhD F:Ah .\nProfessor B:Mmm\nPhD F:So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could\nGrad H:Right , you 'd get {disfmarker}\nPhD F:get back a uh uh {comment} something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred\nGrad H:something {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" .\nPhD F:or some\nProfessor B:That was a really good look . It 's too bad that that couldn't {vocalsound} come into the {disfmarker}\nGrad H:You couldn't get a video .\nPhD G:Guess who I practice on ?\nPostdoc A:At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up .\nProfessor B:Yeah . And then again , maybe not . So , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that soun that sounds reasonable . Yeah , it loo it {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} my recollection of it is it 's {disfmarker} it 's a pretty reasonable uh demo sort of format .\nGrad H:Right .\nPhD F:Yeah that sounds good .\nGrad H:And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally\nPhD F:That sounds really neat .\nGrad H:and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff . Um Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it {disfmarker} it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . So if we wanna just do a video - based one I think that 'll be easy .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's {disfmarker} um , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:So getting them to compile on Windows might be challenging .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD F:But you were saying that {disfmarker} that the uh {disfmarker} that there 's that set of tools , uh , Cygnus tools , that {disfmarker}\nGrad H:So . It certainly helps .\nPhD F:Uh - huh .\nGrad H:Um , I mean without those I wouldn't even attempt it .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD F:Yeah .\nGrad H:But what those {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer ,\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:so that the normal UNIX function calls all work .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD F:And you have to have all the o\nGrad H:Um , But the problem is that {disfmarker} that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and uh different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that um it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows .\nProfessor B:How about having it run under free BSD ?\nPhD E:Well what you need {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Free BSD would probably be easier .\nPhD E:All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day .\nGrad H:That 's true .\nPhD D:Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Right ?\nGrad H:Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore\nPhD E:Right .\nGrad H:so he might have done that already .\nPhD E:I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I wouldn't be surprised .\nProfessor B:So {disfmarker}\nGrad H:I 'll check at that {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:But it would {disfmarker} what would serve {disfmarker} would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it .\nPhD E:What I {disfmarker}\nPhD F:How does it play ?\nGrad H:Yeah , right .\nProfessor B:If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it .\nGrad H:Right .\nPostdoc A:Wow .\nPhD F:I hope he never listens to these meetings .\nGrad H:That 's right . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with uh uh , SoftSound guy , uh {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:It 's amazing .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:Blanking on his name .\nProfessor B:Tony Robinson ?\nPhD F:Tony Robinson ?\nGrad H:Do I mean Tony ? I guess I do .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD E:James Christie .\nGrad H:Or S or Steve Renals .\nProfessor B:Steve Renal - Steve Renals .\nGrad H:Which one do I mean ?\nPhD E:Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ?\nProfessor B:No .\nGrad H:My brain is not working ,\nProfessor B:OK .\nGrad H:I don't remember who I 've been corresponding with .\nPhD E:Steve wro i it 's Ste - Steve Renals wrote THISL IR .\nGrad H:Then it 's Steve Renals .\nProfessor B:Oh , OK .\nPhD E:OK .\nGrad H:So uh just getting documentation and uh and f and formats ,\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:so that 's all going pretty well ,\nProfessor B:Assuming we 're {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Right .\nPhD F:What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ?\nGrad H:I think we 'll be OK with that . Um we have {disfmarker} Well , that 's a good point too .\nPhD E:Here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a crazy idea {pause} actually .\nGrad H:I don't know .\nPhD E:Why don't you try and merge {pause} Transcriber {pause} and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces .\nGrad H:Well this is one of the reasons {disfmarker} This is the {disfmarker} one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have uh Dave Gelbart {disfmarker} Gelbart {disfmarker} Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff\nPhD E:Right .\nGrad H:and he 's more familiar with Tcl - TK than I am .\nPhD E:And then you get {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} then you get the Windows media playing for free .\nGrad H:Well that 's Snack , not {disfmarker} not Transcriber .\nPhD E:Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can {disfmarker} but you can use a {disfmarker} a lot of the same functionality and it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Yeah , yeah , I mean , I {disfmarker} I think THISL {disfmarker} THISL GUI probably uses Snack . And so my intention was just to base it on that .\nPhD E:Yeah . Well my thought was is that it would be nice {disfmarker} it would be nice to have the running transcripts um eh you know , from speaker to speaker .\nGrad H:And if it doesn't {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Right ? Do you have {disfmarker} you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ?\nGrad H:Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so .\nPhD E:Right . Well that {disfmarker} eh my thought was if you had like Multitrans or whatever do it . Or whatever .\nGrad H:Yeah . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in {comment} the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . We {disfmarker} we can look into it ,\nPhD E:Yeah .\nGrad H:but {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:The thing I was asking about with , um , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Yeah , I mean we have to {disfmarker} I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments ,\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:so uh Um My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . Right ? The Windows system isn't any harder because it {disfmarker} it looks like a BSD system .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different .\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad H:So I {disfmarker} it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier .\nProfessor B:OK . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about um some other stuff which would basically be um showing off the {disfmarker} the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but {disfmarker} but um , uh {disfmarker} and part of that was showing off what the speech - non uh nonspeech {comment} stuff that Thilo has done {pause} s {pause} looks like .\nPhD D:Yeah .\nPostdoc A:Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um {disfmarker} ?\nGrad H:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm ,\nPostdoc A:Excellent .\nGrad H:ranked .\nPostdoc A:Excellent . Yeah .\nPhD G:So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody uh {vocalsound} work that Don 's been doing .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD G:Um actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . Um , you know , you can show that graphically , sort of what the features are doing . It , you know , it doesn't work great but it 's definitely giving us something .\nProfessor B:Well I think at {disfmarker} at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that\nPhD G:I don't know if that would be of interest or not .\nProfessor B:cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point\nPhD G:Yeah .\nProfessor B:pointing at something I don't know much about ,\nPhD G:I mean , you 're looking at this now {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:so .\nPhD G:Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ?\nGrad C:Um yeah I 'm starting to and um {disfmarker} Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on .\nPhD G:Yeah def\nProfessor B:S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month\nPhD G:I\nProfessor B:and then that 'll give us a week or so .\nGrad C:Ooo . The end of {disfmarker}\nPhD G:Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ?\nGrad H:This month .\nProfessor B:Ju\nPhD G:Oh .\nProfessor B:June . June . June .\nPhD G:Next month .\nGrad H:Oh sorry , next month .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nPhD G:Sorry .\nGrad H:Today isn't June first ,\nPhD F:There 's another one .\nGrad H:is it .\nProfessor B:Uh {disfmarker} that 'll {disfmarker} that 'll give us {disfmarker} that 'll give us a week or so to uh {disfmarker} to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works ,\nPhD E:Exactly .\nPhD G:Sorry .\nProfessor B:yeah .\nPhD G:I think , I mean eh where {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Yeah , I mean I 'll be here .\nPhD G:Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD G:cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our {disfmarker} you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD G:and so either {disfmarker} it might not be integrated but it {disfmarker} it could potentially be in it .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Well , this is to an audience of researchers\nPhD G:Could find some .\nProfessor B:so I mean , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing .\nPhD G:I mean it 's different .\nProfessor B:So that 's {disfmarker}\nPhD G:I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Good . Done with that . XML tools ?\nGrad H:Um . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you {disfmarker} we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . Um . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now . I mean it works with Transcriber but it {disfmarker} it 's a pain to use it in other tools uh because it doesn't mark start and end .\nPhD F:Start and end of each {disfmarker} ?\nPhD D:Yeah .\nGrad H:Uh {disfmarker} Utterance .\nPhD F:Utterance . Just marks {disfmarker} ?\nGrad H:So it 's implicit in {disfmarker} in there\nPhD F:Yeah .\nGrad H:but you have to do a lot of processing to get it .\nPhD F:Right . Right .\nGrad H:And so {disfmarker} and also I 'd like to do the indirect time line business . Um but regardless , I mean , w that 's something that you , me , and Jane can talk about later . Um , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing {disfmarker} extracting any information from any of these files , either uh information on users because the user database is that way {disfmarker} I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m uh various inf uh sorted information on individual meetings\nGrad C:Cool .\nPhD D:Yeah .\nGrad H:and then also the transcripts . And so l just let me know there {disfmarker} it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if {disfmarker} if that 's desirable .\nPhD G:Oh , quick question on that . Is {disfmarker} do we have the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the seat information ? In {disfmarker} in the Key files now ?\nPostdoc A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which\nPostdoc A:Ah .\nPhD G:Oh in {disfmarker} For the new one\nGrad H:it 's been recorded ,\nPhD G:OK .\nGrad H:yeah .\nProfessor B:Seat ?\nPhD G:Great . Sea - yeah .\nGrad H:Where {disfmarker} where you 're sitting .\nProfessor B:Oh ! Not {disfmarker} not the quality or anything . No .\nPhD D:n\nGrad H:Right .\nProfessor B:OK . I see .\nGrad H:\" It 's pretty soft and squishy . \"\nProfessor B:Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD G:Alright .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD G:OK .\nGrad H:Oh , but that might just be me . Um .\nPhD G:Alright .\nProfessor B:That 's more seat information than we wanted .\nPhD G:Never mind .\nPhD E:Hmm .\nPhD G:I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ?\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:Maybe we should bleep that out .\nProfessor B:Mmm , yeah .\nPhD F:Wait a minute ,\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD F:how {disfmarker} how w eh where is it in the Key file ?\nGrad H:Right . The square bracket .\nPhD G:Cuz I mean I haven't been putting it in and {disfmarker} in by {disfmarker}\nGrad H:You haven't been putting it in .\nPhD G:Right .\nPostdoc A:Well bu\nPhD G:I have not .\nGrad H:Oh , OK .\nPostdoc A:Isn't it always on the digits ?\nProfessor B:Some of these are missing .\nPhD G:And {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Aren't they ?\nPostdoc A:Isn't it always on the digits forms ?\nProfessor B:Some fall out of {disfmarker}\nPhD G:Well it\nGrad H:Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have .\nGrad C:Ooo .\nPhD G:I mean they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files .\nPhD F:Yeah I {disfmarker} I never {disfmarker}\nPhD G:And I don't think Chuck was either\nPhD F:I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file .\nPhD G:cuz {disfmarker}\nGrad H:I had told you guys about it\nPhD F:Oh really ?\nPhD G:Oh , so we 're both sorry .\nGrad H:but {disfmarker}\nPhD G:So {disfmarker}\nGrad H:I mean this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text\nPhD G:OK .\nPhD F:OK .\nGrad H:because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things .\nPhD G:OK .\nGrad H:So . Um if you use the Edit - key , or Key - edit {disfmarker}\nPhD D:Edit - key .\nGrad H:I think it 's Edit - key , {comment} command {disfmarker} Did I show you guys that ?\nPhD D:Yep .\nPhD F:You mentioned it ,\nGrad H:I did show it to you ,\nPhD F:yeah . Yeah .\nGrad H:but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" .\nPhD F:Text .\nGrad H:Um it has it in there , a place to fill it in .\nPhD G:OK .\nPhD F:OK .\nGrad H:Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings .\nPhD G:So if {disfmarker} Right . Well I {disfmarker} I just realized I hadn't been doing it\nGrad H:So .\nPhD G:and probably {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Yep .\nGrad C:u\nGrad H:Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike ,\nPhD G:Yeah . Right .\nGrad H:you actually have to say which one .\nPhD G:I know {disfmarker} Yeah , I usually delete the {disfmarker}\nGrad H:So .\nPhD F:Oh ! OK . I didn't do that either .\nPhD G:I don't ,\nPhD D:Yeah .\nPhD G:maybe I forgot to d\nPhD F:Takes me no time at all to edit these .\nPhD G:But it 's almost {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad H:Yeah that 's cuz you kn\nPhD F:I 'm not doing anything .\nGrad H:I {disfmarker} I know why .\nPhD G:And I was {disfmarker} I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . So .\nGrad H:And then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" .\nProfessor B:Ah , OK .\nPhD G:Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad H:And so that 's also a problem . So anyway .\nPhD G:We will do better .\nGrad H:That 's it . Oh uh also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the {disfmarker} the one that shows up here , {comment} that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because um it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , {comment} are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking .\nGrad C:Huh .\nGrad H:Um these {disfmarker} these ones , they are much easier , there 's a bigger difference . So I 'm working on that and it {disfmarker} it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out .\nGrad C:Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically .\nGrad H:Yep . Yep . Yep .\nPhD F:But with the screensaver kicking in , it {disfmarker}\nPhD D:But\nGrad H:Now {disfmarker}\nPhD D:y yeah .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nPhD D:Yeah .\nGrad H:Well I 'll turn off the screensaver too .\nGrad C:Oops . Speaking of which .\nGrad H:Um the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . There 's a little level meter but of course no one ever pays attention to it . So I think having it on the screen is more easy to notice .\nPostdoc A:It would be nice if {disfmarker} if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Uh buzzer .\nPostdoc A:Yeah , a buzzer .\nGrad H:\" Bamp , bamp ! \"\nProfessor B:Small shocks\nPostdoc A:Yeah . Actually {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:administered to the {disfmarker} OK . Oh {disfmarker}\nGrad H:OK , disk backup , et cetera ? Um I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , {comment} doing uh NW archive to copy it {comment} is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . He w he 's a firm believer in {disfmarker} in lots of different modalities of backup . I mean , his point was well taken . This data cannot be recovered .\nPhD G:Yeah .\nGrad H:And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup .\nProfessor B:Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna {disfmarker} if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups .\nGrad H:Just {disfmarker} just the monthly full .\nPostdoc A:Hmm .\nProfessor B:Yeah , so the monthly full will be a bear but {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Yeah . But he said that {disfmarker} that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK .\nProfessor B:Really ?\nGrad H:And uh , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings .\nProfessor B:So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ?\nGrad H:Things that are recreatable easily and also {disfmarker} Yeah , basically things that are recreatable .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad H:The expanded files and things like that .\nProfessor B:OK .\nGrad H:They take up a lot more room anyway .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:Uh but we do need more disk .\nProfessor B:So we can get more disk . Yeah . So .\nGrad H:Yeah . And I {disfmarker} I think I agree with him . I mean his point was well taken that if we lose one of these we cannot get it back .\nProfessor B:OK .\nGrad H:I don't think there was any other et cetera there .\nProfessor B:Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh {disfmarker}\nPhD E:I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ?\nGrad H:Um unfortunately {disfmarker} we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nGrad H:Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the {disfmarker} the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nGrad H:So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea .\nPhD E:I see . OK .\nGrad H:Cuz th they {disfmarker} they fail after a couple years .\nPhD E:Alright .\nPostdoc A:I do have uh uh {disfmarker} It 's a different topic . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that uh that Thilo you were , um , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th\nPhD D:Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Basically it 's done ,\nPostdoc A:It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . Great .\nPhD D:yeah . Yeah .\nGrad H:Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work .\nPhD D:Yeah it {disfmarker} Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved .\nPostdoc A:Does {disfmarker} and that {disfmarker} does that mean , I {disfmarker}\nPhD D:So .\nPostdoc A:maybe I should know this but I don't . Does this mean that the {disfmarker} that this could be por uh ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of uh {disfmarker}\nPhD D:Yeah , basically uh I did install it on my laptop and yeah\nPostdoc A:Wonderful .\nPhD D:it worked .\nPostdoc A:Wonderful .\nProfessor B:Hmm ! Good . CrossPads ? CrossPads ?\nGrad H:Uh got an email from uh James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them .\nProfessor B:So we 've never used them .\nPostdoc A:We used them once .\nProfessor B:Once ?\nGrad H:We {disfmarker} we used them a couple times ,\nPostdoc A:Mm - hmm . Couple times .\nPhD F:Them ? There 's more than one ?\nGrad H:but {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:i\nGrad H:Yeah , we have two . Um .\nProfessor B:But {disfmarker}\nGrad H:My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it , um and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with .\nPostdoc A:And I have {disfmarker} uh so my {disfmarker} my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I {disfmarker} the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . So you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk , kaplunk . And I {disfmarker} and I don't know if it 's audible on the {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I mean , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but {disfmarker} I don't know .\nPhD D:Uh , what is a CrossPad ?\nProfessor B:So it 's {disfmarker} it 's um {disfmarker} it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position .\nGrad C:Thank you .\nProfessor B:And so you have time and position stuff stored\nPhD D:OK .\nProfessor B:so that you can {disfmarker} you have a record of whatever it is you 've written .\nPhD D:OK .\nGrad H:And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things .\nPhD D:OK . OK .\nGrad H:So i if you take notes it 's a great little device .\nPostdoc A:Could {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:But I don't take notes ,\nProfessor B:And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in {disfmarker} in higher - level things ,\nGrad H:so .\nProfessor B:not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And um I think that was one of the things ,\nPhD D:Yeah .\nPhD G:Yeah .\nGrad H:Yep .\nProfessor B:right ? And so the {disfmarker} it seemed like a neat idea . We 'll have a {disfmarker} you know , have a scribe , have somebody uh take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Yep , and then just sort of died out .\nProfessor B:probably chose the wrong scribe but it was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It 's uh {disfmarker}\nPhD G:I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Yeah that 's right .\nPostdoc A:Well I did it one time\nGrad H:Yep .\nPostdoc A:but um {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPostdoc A:u but I guess the {disfmarker} the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface .\nPhD F:I mean we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ?\nPostdoc A:Oh it 's la it 's useful ,\nGrad H:Because that 's summary .\nPostdoc A:have a summary and high points .\nProfessor B:Summary .\nPhD G:I think {disfmarker} there 's also {disfmarker} there 's this use that {disfmarker}\nPhD F:Summarize it from the transcription .\nPhD G:the {disfmarker} Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're {disfmarker} you just wanna\nPhD F:Doodle .\nPhD G:get the summary of the transcript from this time location like {disfmarker} you know , and {disfmarker} and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and {disfmarker} {comment} But {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with {disfmarker} I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . So . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods\nGrad H:Right .\nPhD G:which you then get back in a transcript\nPostdoc A:Well .\nProfessor B:I guess {disfmarker} so , you know , what {disfmarker} what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later\nPhD G:so .\nProfessor B:and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and put some kind of summary or something uh you know , some {disfmarker} there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But {disfmarker} then you don't {disfmarker} you don't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live .\nPhD G:Right . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful ,\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD F:How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ?\nPhD G:so .\nGrad H:I mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time {disfmarker} the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time {disfmarker}\nPhD G:\nPostdoc A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad H:You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery\nPostdoc A:Well when {disfmarker} when I d\nGrad H:and so you {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:OK .\nGrad H:so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information .\nPostdoc A:w Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:Why {disfmarker}\nGrad H:And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which\nPostdoc A:There is an alternative .\nGrad H:unless someone {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:There is an alternative , I mean , it 's still , there 's uh {disfmarker} you know , your point stands about there be {disfmarker} needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c I mean , I {disfmarker} when I {disfmarker} when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone\nGrad H:Hmm .\nPostdoc A:and uh , you know .\nGrad H:Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end\nPhD E:Right .\nGrad H:which someone has to listen to that and find that point ,\nPostdoc A:Yeah , it 's transcribed . It 's in the transcript .\nGrad H:and then mark it .\nPostdoc A:Yeah .\nGrad H:So .\nPostdoc A:Well it 's in the transcript .\nPhD G:Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h I mean is there a big cau\nGrad H:We can keep all {disfmarker} both of them for the whole whole year .\nPhD G:just {disfmarker} just in case we {disfmarker}\nGrad H:I mean , it 's just {disfmarker}\nPhD G:even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate uh f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I {disfmarker} it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out .\nProfessor B:Well {disfmarker} one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we {disfmarker} we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . I mean ,\nPhD G:Right .\nProfessor B:uh part of the reason {disfmarker} I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in uh the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Yep .\nProfessor B:and so forth so and {disfmarker} and Jane is more into it but eh uh you know I don't know if you wanna really do {disfmarker} do this all the time so I think the thing is to {disfmarker} to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . Um {disfmarker} and if so , it 's probably worth having one . The p the {disfmarker} the problem with the {disfmarker} the more extended view , all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to um uh routinely use it , I mean it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to {disfmarker}\nPhD G:Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just {disfmarker} just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute .\nPhD E:Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And {disfmarker} and that way you can synchronize very easily with the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the {disfmarker} the Linux server and uh {disfmarker}\nPhD G:So what kind of input would you be {disfmarker} ?\nPhD E:so {disfmarker} so , I mean , if you 're not worried about {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Buttons .\nPhD G:You 'd just be pressing like a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Well {disfmarker} well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , I mean , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it .\nPhD G:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:But you could imagine ,\nPhD G:Yeah , that be good .\nPhD E:I mean , if {disfmarker} if all you really wanted was {disfmarker} you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the {disfmarker} probably the right way to go . I mean even buttons you could do , sort of , I mean , as you said .\nGrad H:I mean for what {disfmarker} what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else ,\nPhD G:M right .\nPhD E:Right .\nPhD G:That would be fine too .\nGrad H:right ? You have the {disfmarker}\nPhD G:I mean , I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've {disfmarker} we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at {disfmarker} in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:I like this PDA idea . Yeah .\nProfessor B:Yeah , I do like the idea of having a couple buttons\nPhD G:Yeah .\nGrad H:Well I 'm sure there would {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:where like one {disfmarker} one button was \" uh - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \"\nPhD G:Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button ,\nPostdoc A:Yeah .\nPhD G:like \" I better remember to {disfmarker} \"\nGrad H:Action item .\nPhD G:Yeah something like that or {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:And then {disfmarker}\nGrad H:I mean I think the CrossPad idea is a good one .\nPostdoc A:Uh - huh .\nGrad H:It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work . I mean that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me\nPhD G:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Right .\nPostdoc A:Well , and not just for you .\nGrad H:and {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A:But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too ,\nPhD G:W\nPostdoc A:doesn't it ? I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad H:Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard .\nPostdoc A:But I mean , say , if i if {disfmarker} if you 're writing {disfmarker} if you 're writing notes in it does {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it can't do handwriting recognition , right ?\nProfessor B:No , no , but it 's just {disfmarker} it 's just storing the pixel informa position information ,\nPostdoc A:OK .\nProfessor B:it 's all digital .\nPostdoc A:I {disfmarker} I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a {disfmarker} to a {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Right . You don't have to {disfmarker}\nPhD E:The transfer function is less errorful ,\nPostdoc A:Oh , nicely put .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD E:yes .\nPhD G:Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD G:Well it also {disfmarker} it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year {disfmarker} I don't know .\nGrad H:Well {disfmarker} w we don't {disfmarker} we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All {disfmarker} all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ?\nProfessor B:So we have no but {disfmarker} uh by I {disfmarker} I would suggest you return one . Because we {disfmarker} we you know , we {disfmarker} we haven't used it at all .\nPhD G:Yeah .\nGrad H:OK .\nPhD G:We c\nProfessor B:We have some aspirations of using them\nPhD G:One would probably be fine .\nProfessor B:and {disfmarker}\nPhD G:Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:Yep . I mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more\nProfessor B:Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when somebody laughed .\nGrad H:although there is a little {disfmarker}\nPhD G:Well , I 'm {disfmarker} yeah , that 's not a bad {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nPhD G:Jeremy 's gonna be an {disfmarker} he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool ,\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPhD G:so .\nGrad H:Sounds breathy to me .\nPhD G:OK . \" Ha - ha - ha . \"\nGrad H:Breath and lau \" ha - ha - ha - ha \" . \" Ha - ha - ha - ha . \"\nProfessor B:Well dear .\nGrad H:Um .\nProfessor B:Hmm .\nGrad H:That reminded me of something . Oh well , too late . It slipped out .\nProfessor B:OK .\nPhD G:You 're {disfmarker} you 're gonna tease me ?\nGrad H:Oh , equipment .\nPhD G:OK .\nGrad H:Ordered {disfmarker} Uh , well I 'm always gonna do that . W uh {disfmarker} {comment} We ordered uh more wireless , and so they should be coming in at some point .\nPhD G:Great .\nGrad H:And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that uh the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field .\nProfessor B:You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we ordered more absence of the thing .\nPhD G:That 's a very philosophical statement from Morgan .\nGrad H:wired less , wired more .\nPhD G:I just {disfmarker} it 's sort of a anachronism , I mean it 's like {disfmarker} It 's great .\nProfessor B:Anyway .\nGrad H:Should we do digits ? Do we have anything else ?\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nPostdoc A:OK .\nProfessor B:I mean there 's {disfmarker} there 's all this stuff going on uh between uh Andreas and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs uh um {disfmarker} recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's {disfmarker} it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . Uh why don't we start with our {disfmarker} our esteemed guest .\nPhD E:OK . Alright .\nGrad H:So just the transcript number and then the {disfmarker} then the {disfmarker}\nPhD E:This is {disfmarker} Yes , this is number two for me today .\nProfessor B:See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Oh .\nPhD G:We could do simultaneous . Initiate him .\nProfessor B:We {disfmarker} we could .\nGrad H:Should we do simultaneous ?\nPhD G:Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ?\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad H:Yeah , absolutely .\nPhD G:Yeah , so we might wanna do it simultaneous .\nGrad H:I mean you hav sorta have to .\nProfessor B:Well OK , so let 's do one of those simultaneous ones .\nPhD G:Right , so {disfmarker} so we might n we might need to do that actually .\nProfessor B:That sounds good .\nGrad H:OK .\nPhD E:OK .\nProfessor B:Everybody ready ?\nPostdoc A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:A one .\nPhD G:You have to plug your ears , by the way uh Eric ,\nGrad H:Well I have to ,\nPhD D:You don't have to .\nPhD E:OK , alright .\nPhD G:or {disfmarker} or you start laughing .\nGrad H:I don't know about other people .\nProfessor B:OK , a one and a two and a three . OK , babble , take five .\n",

I thin\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but the the mic should not {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's not a directional mic , anyway .\nProject Manager:I think it should work like this .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:So I will try to get my presentation running .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Can't help you with that .\nUser Interface:Last .\nProject Manager:It's no matter .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , it's y yeah .\nProject Manager:No problem . Ah yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Then press uh al\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:This .\nProject Manager:I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:You know ?\nProject Manager:Just try .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:On this normal {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh oh .\nUser Interface:Alt F_ five .\nProject Manager:Good . Doesn't appear on the screen here .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Wow . Amazing . It's working {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Okay . Thank you . {vocalsound} Uh .\nMarketing:Hold that . Okay .\nProject Manager:Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . Mm .\nProject Manager:Somewhere . So , {vocalsound} good morning , everyone . Um {disfmarker} Welcome at uh {disfmarker} at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I hope you all have been uh updated about it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Good .\nUser Interface:So . Yes .\nProject Manager:So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:See what our roles are in this project . So , um {disfmarker} We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh {disfmarker} to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope {vocalsound} how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Total .\nProject Manager:Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh {disfmarker} wh what uh what our new product should look lite {disfmarker} like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} When you design a new product you of {disfmarker} uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh {disfmarker} we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um {disfmarker} You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a white-board .\nUser Interface:Whitebo\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And um well it should work uh {disfmarker} I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Under documents in the shared folder . Okay .\nProject Manager:Yes . Do {disfmarker} Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes well we will then find out ho how it works .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Um . Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . So , we'll come to that later . So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . So , I would suggest uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Each of us is going .\nProject Manager:Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not really sure how this works , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , shall I start ?\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes ,\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:a good idea Mael .\nUser Interface:you can start it you know .\nMarketing:I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .\nIndustrial Designer:So , i\nUser Interface:No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there\nMarketing:Mm . Mm .\nUser Interface:which is going to record the strokes that you make .\nMarketing:But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Actually , I think I cannot go with uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} D doesn't it work ? Maybe someo Maybe {disfmarker} maybe Anna , maybe you can start .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right .\nMarketing:I have to draw .\nProject Manager:So um {disfmarker} L Why don't you draw uh {vocalsound} your favourite animal on on th on the white-board .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:M my {disfmarker} my favourite animal . {vocalsound} Sorry this is all tangled up here .\nProject Manager:Oh , I see uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's better .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yes . Mm . So draw it . We will try to guess what it is . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} I'm a very bad drawer .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Weird . Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . I'm a bad drawer . Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:They're ears , by the way .\nUser Interface:'s a cat .\nMarketing:No . Um close though . Okay so {disfmarker} like a pet animal .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Like a cat .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No , not a cat though .\nProject Manager:What is this now ?\nUser Interface:Ah you forget about it .\nIndustrial Designer:You're on the knife .\nUser Interface:Yeah , uh I think it's fine . I just don't want to carry it off . Man , this wires , eh ? We need a wireless microphone .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that .\nMarketing:Okay . So .\nProject Manager:So ,\nMarketing:It's not a cat ,\nProject Manager:that's the cat .\nMarketing:it's a dog .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:So .\nIndustrial Designer:Mael .\nProject Manager:It's a dog .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:So but that's also kind of cat ,\nUser Interface:Oh\nProject Manager:isn't it ?\nUser Interface:the dog doesn't have a tail ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's got a tail then .\nProject Manager:B bo both predators .\nUser Interface:Yeah , sure , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:I thought so . The dogs have a tail .\nMarketing:So do cats .\nProject Manager:So , thank you . Uh d did you uh work out cord ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And you guessed cats without a tail . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think I will go without {disfmarker} without it ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:right ?\nUser Interface:It'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that .\nMarketing:Okay , there you go . So what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . A horse ?\nUser Interface:It's a horse .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} This is why you're the designer . And I'm marketing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . Yes , yes this is {disfmarker} Yes definitely a horse . Yes . Oh very good . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Ah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I suppose it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ah I think you can put that .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . That's it . {vocalsound} A blue and black zebra {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . Can {disfmarker} you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:The very rare blue zebras . Yes .\nUser Interface:{gap} I'll tell to get it off my {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ma Matthew ?\nUser Interface:Uh ? Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You got a lot of room here .\nProject Manager:Maybe {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You can probably reach .\nUser Interface:Oh y it's not for that .\nMarketing:No ?\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah . So what should I draw ? Mm . He has already to do cat .\nMarketing:I took a dog . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um . A mouse ?\nProject Manager:This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , the moustache .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's {disfmarker} that's definitely a cat .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah . And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's quite , you know {disfmarker} relaxed situation .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes , okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} She has the small legs .\nProject Manager:Th thank you , Matthew .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} Thank you , Matthew .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Perfect . {vocalsound} Oh a rat , okay .\nProject Manager:Yes , this is certain uh {disfmarker} some contribution to our project . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:And you , {gap}\nMarketing:Your turn .\nProject Manager:So . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet . So you've all drawn land animals ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so why not draw an animal from the water .\nIndustrial Designer:A bird . Okay , in the water .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ah I don't know what that is . It's a bit {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's a bit hard to guess . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Put it colours . Maybe it would help us .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ?\nIndustrial Designer:With different pen widths .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm.$\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh , it's a shark now .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah it's a shark , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh , yes , why not ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Good idea .\nUser Interface:Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nMarketing:Now it's a swordfish .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Why not . A swordfish .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You have some in {disfmarker} in Australia , right ?\nMarketing:Swordfish .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno .\nMarketing:I've never seen one , no .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh well . Yeah .\nProject Manager:I hope it still works . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Perfect . So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You should go for the next one it seems to me .\nProject Manager:W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , exactly , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Let's continue to uh {disfmarker} to the real stuff .\nIndustrial Designer:Wow .\nProject Manager:Um our project uh finance uh thing . Uh when we are {disfmarker} and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh {disfmarker} People uh\nUser Interface:Twenty four .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product .\nIndustrial Designer:Per remote control ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah ? Per project .\nProject Manager:Yes . Okay . Um\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:more interesting for our company {vocalsound} of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh {vocalsound} um things . Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America ,\nUser Interface:Ah yeah , the sale man , four million .\nProject Manager:maybe some uh Asian countries . Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics .\nProject Manager:Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ?\nUser Interface:They have to sell at least four million to make a profit {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Of course .\nMarketing:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You all have to be paid .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Excuse me ?\nUser Interface:Ah we have to make {disfmarker} we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill\nIndustrial Designer:Oh you're g very good in mathematics .\nMarketing:Yes . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , indeed .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Four million .\nProject Manager:So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think . So , that about finance . And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Of course it should have a on off button . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:You might need uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We wer we were thinking television . Uh .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:We are targ targeting the television set . So ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:you need to record the channels .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} You need to browse the {disfmarker} browse the channels in upward downward way ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yes , yes . Th th that's very handy I {disfmarker} I always miss it and {disfmarker} on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm . Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we are the marketing guy ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I'm marketing .\nUser Interface:Marketing .\nIndustrial Designer:th So you are the marketing .\nMarketing:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:And you are in the u use user interface uh design .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So just {disfmarker} yeah I wanted to to be sure .\nUser Interface:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:And I I'm the the industrial designer\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:okay .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah .\nUser Interface:I'm Matthew . You know . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Mael .\nUser Interface:Matth s uh\nIndustrial Designer:Happy to meet you .\nMarketing:Anna .\nUser Interface:Anna .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . It's very uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:A and I'm Nanne .\nUser Interface:And um uh Matthew , yeah .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I thi think you know me ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh so yeah uh {disfmarker} Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh {disfmarker} not face to face .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:yeah ? right yeah .\nProject Manager:So . Um {disfmarker} S\nUser Interface:So .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:S s\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Are there some other very important things to to do {disfmarker} well ,\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So I\nProject Manager:to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah .\nUser Interface:And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then {disfmarker} you uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm . But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Ah it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up .\nProject Manager:Mm , well uh I I think {disfmarker} Uh w y you two should {disfmarker} should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Actually , yeah\nUser Interface:Let's {disfmarker} Let's take {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:w {vocalsound} Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah . Mm . Yeah . But {disfmarker} Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .\nProject Manager:Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a {disfmarker} it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and then um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:The {disfmarker} Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay , we are alread mm . Mm .\nProject Manager:So\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:you know now the basic {disfmarker} the basic things .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:well just {disfmarker} just for the next meeting , um\nUser Interface:L\nProject Manager:well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean {disfmarker} so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um you will be working on {disfmarker} on technical function design , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:And uh you {disfmarker} and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:eh ? Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface .\nUser Interface:Stam .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So next meeting will be in uh {disfmarker} in thirty minutes uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Perfect .\nProject Manager:K keep it in mind .\n",

Thanks .\nProject Manager:So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting . And uh opening and uh P_M_s {gap} of the meet minutes , uh prototype presentation from uh Christine and uh Agnes .\nIndustrial Designer:Agnes , yes .\nProject Manager:Yes and uh evaluation criteria . The finance , it's uh from my side , from the management , and uh production evaluation . Then uh closing . So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so {disfmarker} Okay , let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype .\nUser Interface:Mm , okay .\nProject Manager:So I handle to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me .\nProject Manager:So shall I go to {disfmarker} sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh thank you , so you did a PowerPoint presentation , good for you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yep . S Okay , let's go to A_M_I_ .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So in two or three or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Three . Um . {vocalsound} No it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Probably . Technical pa I would think .\nUser Interface:think it's the last one . No , then this is {vocalsound} the la yeah , that one , final design .\nMarketing:Ha .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um okay , can I have the mouse ?\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Thanks . Alright , so from {disfmarker} when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . {vocalsound} Um , so {vocalsound} to unveil our lovely product . This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . {vocalsound} Um , this is actually hard to do . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . So up {disfmarker} volume up , down {disfmarker} volume down . The green are the channel changing . {vocalsound} S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and uh I could {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah the d\nUser Interface:Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the {disfmarker} under the flip .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , okay . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:So that will be the safe , so p any {disfmarker} the chip {disfmarker} it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone {gap} to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh it's it's {disfmarker} Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised .\nUser Interface:But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And you don't wanna let go of either one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I don't wanna say . Louder . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere .\nMarketing:Can also be on the side .\nProject Manager:Yeah , the sides maybe is good .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes . So it's maybe good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been {disfmarker} not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes . Yeah {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Yeah , exactly .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So it's maybe good idea . S s\nIndustrial Designer:It's um {disfmarker} It's um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Compliments to the artist .\nIndustrial Designer:You need to work on the weight a little bit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Okay . S {vocalsound} I'm fine , I'm satisfi\nUser Interface:And maybe the shape of the buttons ,\nProject Manager:I'm satisfied .\nUser Interface:the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We're glad you're satisfied .\nProject Manager:Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely {gap} maybe it's a less weight .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I mean this is plasticene .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:There's only so much you can do . We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight ,\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:it needs to feel like you're still holding something . {vocalsound} So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually .\nProject Manager:That's your uh prototype model ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , that's good , thank you very much .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So any comments or uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes , that uh {disfmarker} So I'll come back to the {disfmarker} {gap} So evaluation criteria , I think uh that will be good , so then let's come to the finance uh , I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget . So here you can uh look like uh the energy {gap} and uh {gap} dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . Uh it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what uh we were talking about that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . So it's uh {disfmarker} actually , our budget was uh twelve point five Euro , but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under uh {disfmarker} below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . I think it's a good figure . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , great I {disfmarker} I'm surprised .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Congratulations . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Than thank you . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well we haven't come to mine yet , so {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , okay\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:. It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ?\nMarketing:we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So maybe it's {disfmarker} for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing , for the sales , okay , and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a {vocalsound} o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive ,\nUser Interface:No we do , but it's not filled in .\nMarketing:it's gonna be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's not .\nIndustrial Designer:Thirty .\nMarketing:It's not {disfmarker} it doesn't say .\nUser Interface:It's number thirty .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:We don't have the price up there ,\nUser Interface:Oh , yeah , yeah ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:you're right , sorry , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So that means we can put the uh {disfmarker} the L_C_D_ in , yeah .\nMarketing:Display in . But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh {vocalsound} the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that {gap} has to be taken in into consideration .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes , so still uh we have twelve point five Euro .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh {disfmarker} the cost of the unit for the company .\nProject Manager:Yes . {gap} Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yep .\nUser Interface:Um-hmm .\nMarketing:So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways .\nProject Manager:Yes . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on {disfmarker} on-order basis , it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh\nMarketing:Slightly .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's gonna be very hard to reduce .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would uh {vocalsound} be fixed at the {disfmarker} Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro .\nMarketing:That's not bad . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's really {disfmarker} that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding .\nProject Manager:Yep . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down .\nMarketing:If we can go to to my display . And we'll come back to yours\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:just to give everybody an idea of the market . So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:If I'm still here .\nProject Manager:You're in four ?\nMarketing:{gap} Yep The four gives me {disfmarker} it's gotta be uh TrendWatch .\nProject Manager:TrendWatch .\nIndustrial Designer:Is this the same one you did before ?\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:It shouldn't be\nUser Interface:That's {disfmarker} no , I think it's the same one .\nMarketing:if it's not {disfmarker} it's not the right one . No , no we g no , that's the same one . You have to go back and find another one . Whatever name it popped up under .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Functional .\nMarketing:Uh functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It looks like it , there's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} S Yeah .\nMarketing:Yep , that's it . So we'll go screen by screen .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Although {vocalsound} since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it {disfmarker} this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study .\nProject Manager:Yep . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:So if we continue , we'll look at the findings . Next screen . {vocalsound} Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:which is actually a tremendous amount .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , no kidding . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No kidding , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mayb maybe they already expected something .\nMarketing:So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav {gap} gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers .\nUser Interface:Um-hmm .\nMarketing:Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Yep .\nMarketing:Okay ? So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the {disfmarker} of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now .\nProject Manager:Yes . Yep . Of course .\nMarketing:So , now we have to come up with a decision .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Can the company sell two million units ?\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:Can it sell it for fifty Euros ?\nIndustrial Designer:Could could I go to findings ?\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I was thinking the same thing , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence .\nUser Interface:Directly .\nIndustrial Designer:That way you have no storage , you have no um {disfmarker} you do have transportation , still have the labour cost ,\nUser Interface:Um-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:The point of sale is online .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:To the agents .\nUser Interface:Yeah . You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , like Amazon . In fact , we should sell through Amazon ,\nProject Manager:Yes . Or eBay , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:don't you think ? Or eBay , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:There's an idea .\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Going with um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:To impro more profit and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:S Upscale technology .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah , we we're do you know , selling a unique product uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well .\nUser Interface:That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:There are several companies that have gone that way .\nUser Interface:whereas if you're in a store , you can't {disfmarker} unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . And you can even have an {disfmarker} a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight .\nUser Interface:Yeah . The weight and feel .\nMarketing:Weight , the feel of the product , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We're getting used to that . It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:There are several that have gone through with the watches , too . You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:you can change it uh {disfmarker} There's a lot of online that's {disfmarker} that is doing this now .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh {disfmarker} it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could {vocalsound} you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:We can .\nIndustrial Designer:Great .\nProject Manager:I don't think that's uh not possible , it's uh {disfmarker} okay then , l uh let's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real .\nUser Interface:What turnaround time do we have ?\nProject Manager:T\nUser Interface:'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long .\nProject Manager:Oh but {disfmarker} Yes it's it's very quick , of course . It will uh come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks .\nIndustrial Designer:Works for me .\nProject Manager:For evaluation , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Prototypes , you mean .\nProject Manager:Yes , the prototype uh {disfmarker} prototype product evaluation .\nIndustrial Designer:In um {disfmarker} We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it .\nProject Manager:Yes . Yes . Yes .\nMarketing:Well , obviously .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea ,\nProject Manager:So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks .\nMarketing:to see {disfmarker} get get their {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:it's not a trivial task .\nProject Manager:Yeah , because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua\nUser Interface:No no . We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . Or uh {disfmarker} Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team , okay , uh from the management , then we can launch in the market . Hm ?\nIndustrial Designer:Any outstanding {disfmarker} {vocalsound} ?\nProject Manager:S Any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss ?\nIndustrial Designer:No , I'm\nUser Interface:What ab\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} go ahead .\nMarketing:I think we pretty much covered everything .\nProject Manager:Okay , so then uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Did you have something ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently .\nProject Manager:Okay uh , let's take like this . Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So no more changes will be made , okay , in this {disfmarker} the basic design . Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the\nIndustrial Designer:Second generation .\nProject Manager:second generation .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . There's no end , there's not limit .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of .\nProject Manager:Every every custom\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , then it may not be .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit .\nMarketing:Like people don't like wood . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up .\nMarketing:{gap} very specific .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so that's the reason you are here for uh the design , okay , I hope you made a good design .\nUser Interface:Yes , but I'm not everybody .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh {disfmarker} you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so we have we have to balance somewhere .\nUser Interface:Yeah , of course . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short {disfmarker} well you have no redesign {disfmarker} not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Our project doesn't {disfmarker} um\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ?\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Would it be the Christmas season by any chance ?\nProject Manager:The sports time .\nIndustrial Designer:Sports season . Which sport season ?\nMarketing:Right before the Eur {vocalsound} the World Cup . {vocalsound} World soccer . World Cup soccer ,\nProject Manager:Football .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} so\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control .\nProject Manager:Football .\nIndustrial Designer:maybe what {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final {disfmarker} the the launch of a user-tested device with some {gap} special event .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:And and then um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Or any major sports .\nIndustrial Designer:Or another {gap} m major sports event . Probably not the um the football games coming up the end of January . I think that might be a little too aggressive um ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but , so , I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing\nProject Manager:Research .\nIndustrial Designer:pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:or uh perhaps to uh also {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's actually good place to advertise it too .\nIndustrial Designer:And to work with motion pictures .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um {disfmarker} that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yes , the {disfmarker} that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's great . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Sure , sure , yes .\nUser Interface:A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy .\nIndustrial Designer:Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Really ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years {disfmarker} that was a disposable consumer product ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That I didn't know . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and uh people {disfmarker} the market hadn't really {vocalsound} gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design ,\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um {disfmarker} so , you're right , timing is very important ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but I think we've got a good product .\nProject Manager:That's the reason Ed is here .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right . It's gonna be very important to the company . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . We are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:He's on the big screen .\nMarketing:Yeah , I'm the one who takes the heat .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Exactly . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Good luck , Ed .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} If it's a flop , it's the marketer . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the uh the weight on your shoulders , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes . Yes . Stress . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget\nMarketing:Celebration . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and uh is the product evaluated , okay , so that will uh come soon . Okay for uh {disfmarker} but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate . So let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Sounds good .\nProject Manager:'S good .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Very good .\nIndustrial Designer:Nice working with you .\nMarketing:Thank you very much .\nProject Manager:Thank you . Thank you again for all .\nUser Interface:Thanks\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And see you in the evening for drinks .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bye-bye . Yep , okay , see you later on . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Bye .\n",
        "summary": "Project Manager initiated the final meeting on the topic of detailed design. Industrial Designer and User Interface each gave a presentation on the prototype and discussed the evaluation criteria, especially that of microphone and buttons. Next, the group did calculations on the budget as well as the profit goal before Marketing showed the challenges of this project in terms of budget control and reaching the profit target. The group then discussed using the internet for promotion and ordering and drop-shipping the product to the customer's residence. Finally, the subject moved to product evaluation by putting the prototype on the market and analyzing the feedback. The group discussed whether they should spare time for the redesign process before releasing the product to the market. Then Industrial Designer put up a strategy to do effective user research by choosing sports seasons.",

Welcome to the {disfmarker} what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . Um okay , oh the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um {disfmarker} Okay\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . Um So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda {disfmarker} so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it ,\nProject Manager:Yep ,\nIndustrial Designer:or if you hold it up like that it'll send it .\nProject Manager:yeah , good , good .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:so you can you know talk to it like that\nProject Manager:Yep ,\nIndustrial Designer:and it'll still understand .\nProject Manager:right .\nIndustrial Designer:Um the logo is down down there um\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and {gap} has the cover on it\nUser Interface:S\nIndustrial Designer:and you can see like it just kinda goes {disfmarker} the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything\nProject Manager:Yep , yep ,\nIndustrial Designer:and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um .\nProject Manager:mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic ,\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:just kind of a light {vocalsound} non-descript grey\nProject Manager:Yep yep .\nUser Interface:so that people'll wanna buy the covers\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers ,\nProject Manager:{gap} showing me age ,\nUser Interface:so they kinda just stretch over .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:I don't know what i c iPod covers are like .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , well\nProject Manager:Yeah {gap} yeah .\nUser Interface:I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of {disfmarker} it's just kind of a rubbery {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and that way {disfmarker} you know\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nUser Interface:spongy like is something that people wanted\nProject Manager:yep , right .\nUser Interface:and it just sort of stretches over\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:just kinda stretch it over\nIndustrial Designer:and it'll be fine .\nProject Manager:Okay , good yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and it'll just stay on\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and then the buttons come through and so {disfmarker} and then the {disfmarker} each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ .\nProject Manager:Yep , right .\nIndustrial Designer:Li that'll be {gap} the covers as well , yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered {disfmarker} I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ?\nUser Interface:Like that .\nProject Manager:Right . Okay {gap} for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it could stand , yeah .\nProject Manager:but uh uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Well we could broaden the {disfmarker} broaden it out a bit\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , uh no\nIndustrial Designer:so it would stand like that .\nProject Manager:because {gap} particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , {gap} standing .\nProject Manager:uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , we could just widen it out uh\nProject Manager:Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm .\nProject Manager:because {gap} actually have several {gap} upon the uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Could have one for your stereo , one for your {gap} D_V_ player .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , well .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Have to {disfmarker} if we just lengthen it I guess\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah\nIndustrial Designer:so it comes down to the base of the hand\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:but that that's uh {disfmarker} but uh\nUser Interface:just kind of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and then flatten it out\nProject Manager:no\nIndustrial Designer:and could sit there .\nProject Manager:the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , {vocalsound} mm .\nUser Interface:Or just make it little .\nProject Manager:yeah yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Somewhere like that\nProject Manager:no no , I mean that's {disfmarker} these uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:so it just sort of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We might {gap} have to lengthen it\nMarketing:Yeah I kinda had a a kinda {disfmarker} a natural kind of a idea\nIndustrial Designer:so it kinda {disfmarker} your hand still holds it and have it there ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that {gap} . Yeah .\nMarketing:where it's like more of a kind of {disfmarker} like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner ,\nUser Interface:Bu\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah , kinda like that kinda {gap} like a flower or a plant\nProject Manager:But uh yeah {disfmarker} but no th but the {disfmarker} yeah the the the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:for the more natural kinda {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} The final product would actually stand up , yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:I mean it it's uh {disfmarker} wouldn't\nUser Interface:{gap} fall over .\nProject Manager:wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . But th th but th yeah th b the\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:these were all minor minor uh minor details ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} . 'S a little longer .\nProject Manager:and the {disfmarker} i\nIndustrial Designer:Wee {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:it certainly meets our criteria of being uh {disfmarker} of you know looking different .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um , so\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:good that's that that's excellent .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um right let us um What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um f finance . Um , now we're given a a clear design brief , uh if I {gap} get the uh spreadsheet up . Oh .\nMarketing:Uh yeah , {vocalsound} just click there .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nMarketing:Uh the the maximise button .\nProject Manager:Oh right . Ah . Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Now I've um {vocalsound} this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're {vocalsound} we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole {gap} the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . Um and uh we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um {vocalsound} slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings uh come in at {disfmarker} exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um {vocalsound} any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:so uh um you know the {disfmarker} if if if the management expect us to be techno {gap} again {gap} fail again {disfmarker} technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um . Okay , uh . So um . Does anybody want to uh {disfmarker} uh Andrew do you want {disfmarker} what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation\nMarketing:Evaluation .\nProject Manager:where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ?\nMarketing:The {vocalsound} the product or the project ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The the the well the {disfmarker} I meant the product .\nMarketing:Um , well well my presentation just now ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Sure , uh can I get the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh sorry yeah um , mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm . More loud clicks in the microphone .\nMarketing:Cheers . {vocalsound} There we go , oh . Method of evaluation {vocalsound} testing the product was to just {gap} if it met all the criteria {disfmarker} all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:um gauge our team response to these questions . So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Seven being a nice round number to work to .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . And then at the end just take an average\nProject Manager:Tr On for true and seven for flase . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yes {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So uh . {vocalsound} So , look at these questions . Is the device f flashy and fashionable ?\nProject Manager:Well I think most definitely .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah .\nUser Interface:I think it is yeah .\nMarketing:So uh {disfmarker} and also uh technologically innovative ?\nProject Manager:Yes the voice technology indeed .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , defi yeah , yeah\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Easy to use ?\nProject Manager:I don't see we could've made it any easier .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh suitable for the consumer ? That was um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Totally .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah definitely .\nUser Interface:Yeah I think it made {disfmarker} we met all of the consumer\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:wants .\nMarketing:Uh is it complicated ?\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? {vocalsound} Uh functional ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah definitely .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um . {vocalsound} Where are we ?\nProject Manager:{gap} found easily . {gap} yeah\nMarketing:We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function .\nProject Manager:I mean that's that's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Does it take long to learn to use ? Shouldn't .\nIndustrial Designer:No , not at all .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . And uh , what else ? {vocalsound} The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Less buttons so it must be .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:well . We we\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nMarketing:uh yeah it was our {disfmarker} it was a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well .\nMarketing:we made an actual effort to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So yeah , um um .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um will device appeal to all age groups ?\nProject Manager:I think it will because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:I think so .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:uh that's a good call , yeah . Well we had the we had the data {gap} saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , {vocalsound} the e ease of use of the device might make up for that .\nProject Manager:And it's it's it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and the younger people tend to {disfmarker} would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah .\nProject Manager:It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah I think just the simplicity of it\nProject Manager:yeah yeah\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:and\nProject Manager:so I I {disfmarker} yeah I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:not having to learn to programme\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:and not having you know a million buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:why not ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:is t it's television only ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:it's it's simple to use ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:um it's it's it's within budget ,\nUser Interface:Under the cost .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yep .\nProject Manager:um I {disfmarker} it's uh {disfmarker} yes an an any minor points we we we argue .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um .\nProject Manager:So uh I I think we've done an amazing job\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:in uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well done us {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} coming up with what {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . Eleven divided by {vocalsound} eleven's one so {vocalsound} equals average of one .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{gap} Need a need a calculator for that .\nMarketing:And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product .\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Excellent .\nProject Manager:{gap} nick the cable back then .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh no\nUser Interface:I mixed up the colours a little bit .\nIndustrial Designer:that's {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think I {gap} all wrong .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Ooh . Right do um either of you want to uh say anything ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Before I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Ps I don't think so ,\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nUser Interface:I mean I think we worked well together\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and come to group consensus and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well that's right , I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , I mean\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah , definitely .\nProject Manager:I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh {disfmarker} I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:uh a new approach . Um are the costs within budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Thank you very much indeed , I think that {disfmarker} I think that's uh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Cool , thank you {vocalsound} ,\nUser Interface:Alright .\nProject Manager:I think we can go f for an early bath .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So I call the meeting closed .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .\n",
        "summary": "This is the last meeting of the design group. At first, Industrial Designer introduced the remote control prototype to the group. It included buttons for channel change, power, menu and also had a slider for volume, an infra-red section and a microphone. The cover was interchangeable with a company logo on it. It was also made of a rubbery material and could stretch over. Then Project Manager went through the costs of various aspects of design and argued that a slight compromise could be made as the remote control would be a fashion accessory and have interchangeable covers. After that, Marketing specifically summed up the evaluation criteria of remote control. Finally, Project Manager concluded and praised the teamwork results.",

Um , this is t\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad A:When you read the numbers it kind of reminded me of beat poetry .\nGrad D:I tried to go for the EE Cummings sort of feeling , but {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Three three six zero zero . Four two zero zero one seven . That 's what I think of when I think of beat poetry .\nGrad C:Beat poetry .\nGrad A:You ever seen \" So I married an axe murderer \" ?\nGrad C:Uh parts of it .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:There 's a part wh there 's parts when he 's doing beat poetry .\nGrad C:Oh yeah ?\nGrad A:And he talks like that . That 's why I thi That uh probably is why I think of it that way .\nGrad D:Hmm . No , I didn't see that movie . Who did {disfmarker} who made that ?\nGrad A:Mike Meyers is the guy .\nGrad D:Oh . OK .\nGrad A:It - it 's his uh {disfmarker} it 's his cute romantic comedy . That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} That 's his cute romantic comedy , yeah . The other thing that 's real funny , I 'll spoil it for you . is when he 's {disfmarker} he works in a coffee shop , in San Francisco , and uh he 's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso , and he 's like \" excuse me I ordered the large espresso ? \"\nGrad D:Uh . We 're having , {vocalsound} a tiramisu tasting contest this weekend .\nGrad A:Wait {disfmarker} do are y So you 're trying to decide who 's the best taster of tiramisu ?\nGrad D:No ? Um . There was a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best and so we decided to have a contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them ,\nGrad A:Ah .\nGrad D:and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste {disfmarker} do a blind taste {vocalsound} and then vote .\nGrad A:Hmm .\nGrad D:Should be fun .\nGrad A:Seems like {disfmarker} Seems like you could put a s magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours . Then , if you were to bribe them , you could uh {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Mm - hmm . Well , I was thinking if um {disfmarker} y you guys have plans for Sunday ? We 're {disfmarker} we 're not {disfmarker} it 's probably going to be this Sunday , but um we 're sort of working with the weather here because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what {disfmarker} whoever brings whatever you know , can throw it on there . So only the tiramisu is free , nothing else .\nGrad A:Well , I 'm going back to visit my parents this weekend , so , I 'll be out of town .\nGrad D:So you 're going to the west Bay then ? No ,\nGrad A:No , the South Bay ,\nGrad D:south Bay ?\nGrad A:yeah .\nGrad D:South Bay .\nGrad C:Well , I should be free , so .\nGrad D:OK , I 'll let you know .\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad A:We are . Is Nancy s uh gonna show up ? Mmm . Wonder if these things ever emit a very , like , piercing screech right in your ear ?\nGrad D:They are gonna get more comfortable headsets . They already ordered them . OK .\nGrad C:Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Let 's get started . The uh {disfmarker} Should I go first , with the uh , um , data . Can I have the remote {vocalsound} control . Thank you . OK . So . On Friday we had our wizard test data test and um {vocalsound} these are some of the results . This was the introduction . I actually uh , even though Liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject , I sort of felt that she knew too much , so I asked uh Litonya . just on the spur of the moment , and she was uh kind enough to uh serve as the first subject .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:So , this is what she saw as part of {disfmarker} as uh for instr introduction , this is what she had to read {pause} aloud . Uh , that was really difficult for her and uh {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Because of l all the names , you mean ?\nGrad D:The names and um this was the uh first three tasks she had to {disfmarker} to master after she called the system , and um then of course the system broke down , and those were the l uh uh I should say the system was supposed to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve , with a human {disfmarker} Um . There are {disfmarker} here are uh the results . Mmm . And I will not {disfmarker} We will skip the reading now . D Um . And um . The reading was five minutes , exactly . And now comes the {disfmarker} This is the phone - in phase of {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Wait , can I {disfmarker} I have a question . So . So there 's no system , right ? Like , there was a wizard for both uh {disfmarker} both parts , is this right ?\nGrad D:Yeah . It was bo it both times the same person .\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad D:One time , pretending to be a system , one time , to {disfmarker} pretending to be a human , which is actually not pretending .\nGrad C:OK . And she didn't {disfmarker}\nGrad D:I should {disfmarker}\nGrad C:I mean . Well . Isn't this kind of obvious when it says \" OK now you 're talking to a human \" and then the human has the same voice ?\nGrad D:No no no . We u Wait . OK , good question , but uh you {disfmarker} you just wait and see .\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad D:It 's {disfmarker} You 're gonna l learn . And um the wizard sometimes will not be audible , Because she was actually {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} there was some uh lapse in the um wireless , we have to move her closer .\nGrad A:Is she mispronouncing \" Anlage \" ? Is it \" Anlaga \" or \" Anlunga \"\nGrad D:They 're mispronouncing everything ,\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad D:but it 's {disfmarker} This is the system breaking down , actually . \" Did I call Europe ? \" So , this is it . Well , if we {disfmarker} we um\nProfessor B:So , are {disfmarker} are you trying to record this meeting ?\nGrad D:There was a strange reflex . I have a headache . I 'm really sort of out of it . OK , the uh lessons learned . The reading needs to be shorter . Five minutes is just too long . Um , that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} subjects are probably not gonna {disfmarker} going to follow the order . And uh she did not .\nGrad C:Really ?\nGrad D:She {disfmarker} No .\nGrad C:Oh , it 's surprising .\nGrad D:She {disfmarker} she jumped around quite a bit .\nProfessor B:S so if you just number them \" one \" , \" two \" , \" three \" it 's\nGrad D:Yeah , and make it sort of clear in the uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:OK . Right .\nGrad D:Um . We need to {disfmarker} So that 's one thing . And we need a better introduction for the wizard . That is something that Fey actually thought of a {disfmarker} in the last second that sh the system should introduce itself , when it 's called .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm . True .\nGrad D:And um , um , another suggestion , by Liz , was that we uh , through subjects , switch the tasks . So when {disfmarker} when they have task - one with the computer , the next person should have task - one with a human , and so forth .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:So we get nice um data for that . Um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we haven't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing , so where , even though w we don't tell the person \" ask {pause} blah - blah - blah - blah - blah \" they still try , or at least Litonya tried to um repeat as much of that text as possible .\nGrad C:Say exactly what 's on there ? Yeah .\nGrad D:And uh my suggestion is of course we {disfmarker} we keep the wizard , because I think she did a wonderful job ,\nProfessor B:Great .\nGrad D:in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for , \" How much is a t a bus ticket and a transfer \" so this is gonna happen all the time , we d you can never be sure .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:Um . Johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard .\nGrad A:Yes .\nGrad D:So um .\nGrad A:I wasn't {disfmarker} wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for {pause} uh \" not a man \" .\nGrad C:There 's no female equivalent of {disfmarker}\nGrad D:But uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Are you sure ?\nGrad C:No , I don't know .\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad C:Not that I know of .\nGrad D:Well , there is witch and warlock ,\nGrad A:Yeah , that 's so @ @ .\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad C:Yeah , that 's what I was thinking , but {disfmarker}\nGrad D:and uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Right . Uh .\nGrad D:OK . And um {disfmarker} So , some {disfmarker} some work needs to be done , but I think we can uh {disfmarker} And this , and {disfmarker} in case no {disfmarker} you hadn't seen it , this is what Litonya looked at during the uh {disfmarker} um while taking the {disfmarker} while partaking in the data collection .\nGrad C:Ah .\nProfessor B:OK , great . So {pause} first of all , I agree that um we should hire Fey , and start paying her . Probably pay for the time she 's put in as well . Um , do you know exactly how to do that , or is uh Lila {disfmarker} I mean , you know what exactly do we do to {disfmarker} to put her on the payroll in some way ?\nGrad D:I 'm completely clueless , but I 'm willing to learn .\nProfessor B:OK . Well , you 'll have to . Right . So anyway , um\nGrad D:N\nProfessor B:So why don't you uh ask Lila and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in th\nGrad D:Student - type worker ,\nProfessor B:Well , yeah she 's un she 's not a {disfmarker} a student ,\nGrad D:or {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor B:she just graduated but anyway .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nProfessor B:So i if {disfmarker} Yeah , I agree , she sounded fine , she a actually was {pause} uh , more uh , present and stuff than {disfmarker} than she was in conversation , so she did a better job than I would have guessed from just talking to her .\nGrad D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:So I think that 's great .\nGrad D:This is sort of what I gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison ,\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad D:and I didn't even spell it out here and in some cases I {disfmarker} I spelled it out a little bit um more thoroughly ,\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad D:this is the information on {disfmarker} on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up , and um , so i if we give her even more um , instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better .\nProfessor B:Oh , yeah , and then of course as she does it she 'll {disfmarker} she 'll learn @ @ .  So that 's great . Um {pause} And also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor B:And , uh she 's {disfmarker} actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm , so I think this is all just fine in terms of h her learning things she 's gonna need to know uh , to do her career .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor B:So , I {disfmarker} my guess is she 'll be r r quite happy to take on that job . And , so {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Yep . Yeah she {disfmarker} she didn't explicitly state that so .\nProfessor B:Great .\nGrad D:And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people . She also agrees that you know if it 's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that so .\nProfessor B:Well , as I say there is this s set of people next door , it 's not hard to\nGrad D:We 're already {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor B:uh {disfmarker}\nGrad D:However , we may run into a problem with a reading task there . And um , we 'll see .\nProfessor B:Yeah . We could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something ,\nGrad D:Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor B:but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff . And {disfmarker} and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent .\nGrad D:Mmm . Yep .\nProfessor B:Uh , so that 's good . Um . Now , {pause} I signed us up for the Wednesday slot , and part of what we should do is this .\nGrad D:OK .\nProfessor B:So , my idea on that was {pause} uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly I did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all {disfmarker} um you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically , because to the extent that we can get them contributing , that will be good . So this issue about you know re - formulating things ,\nGrad D:Yep .\nProfessor B:maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it , uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist , but in any case ,\nGrad D:Yep .\nProfessor B:um , the linguistics students and stuff . So my idea on {disfmarker} on Wednesday is partly to uh {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean , what you did today would {disfmarker} i is just fine . You just uh do \" this is what we did , and here 's the {pause} thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and {disfmarker} and so forth . \" But then , the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of {disfmarker} of what 's going on with the system design , and where we think the belief - nets fit in and where the pieces are and stuff like that . Is {disfmarker} is this {pause} make sense to everybody ?\nGrad D:Yep .\nProfessor B:Yeah . So , I don't {disfmarker} I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to make a big presentation . I don't think you should {disfmarker} you don't have to make any new {pause} uh PowerPoint or anything . I think we got plenty of stuff to talk about . And , then um just see how a discussion goes .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm . Sounds good . The uh other two things is um we 've {disfmarker} can have Johno tell us a little about this\nProfessor B:Great .\nGrad D:and we also have a l little bit on the interface , M - three - L enhancement , and then um that was it , I think .\nGrad A:So , what I did for this {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} uh , a pedagogical belief - net because I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I took {disfmarker} I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out {disfmarker} so what I did was I took {disfmarker} I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector .\nProfessor B:Yep .\nGrad A:And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal .\nProfessor B:Yep .\nGrad A:And I separated them out . And then I um did similar things for our {disfmarker} our net to {disfmarker} uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot , um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the {disfmarker} the top layer .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:And then the bottom layer is just the Mode . So .\nProfessor B:So , let 's {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker} Yeah , I don't understand it . Let 's go {disfmarker} Slide all the way up so we see what the p the p very bottom looks like , or is that it ?\nGrad A:Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says \" Mode \" which is the decision between the {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:OK , great . Alright .\nGrad A:So basically all I did was I took the last {pause} belief - net\nProfessor B:So {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:and I grouped things according to what {disfmarker} how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related . And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones .\nProfessor B:Yep . Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:And then I said well , uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably .\nProfessor B:Right , yep .\nGrad A:Um , you know , we have {disfmarker} we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad A:or they were hurried . That 's kind of related to that . And then um in terms of the source , the things {disfmarker} uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether {disfmarker} Oh actually , I kind of , {disfmarker} I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but uh whether the {disfmarker} where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:or the \" landmark - iness \" of where I 'm currently at . And \" usefulness \" is basi basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that 's not {disfmarker} something that you 'd visit for tourist 's {disfmarker} tourism 's sake or whatever . \" Travel constraints \" would be something like you know , maybe they said they can {disfmarker} they only wanna take a bus or something like that , right ? And then those are somewhat related to the path ,\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:so that would determine whether we 'd {disfmarker} could take {disfmarker} we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly . Um , \" Goal \" . Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination . Um , and then if you go up , Robert , Yeah , so {disfmarker} um , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person . Um , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:Uh , Prosody I don't really {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure what prosody means , in this context , so I just made up you know whether {disfmarker} whether what they say is {disfmarker} or h how they say it is {disfmarker} is that .\nProfessor B:Right , OK .\nGrad A:Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose , and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said \" I need to get there quickly \" or whatever .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot .\nGrad D:What 's \" tourbook \" ?\nGrad A:Tourbook ? That would be , I don't know , the \" landmark - iness \" of things ,\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:whether it 's in the tourbook or not .\nProfessor B:Ch - ch - ch - ch . Now . Alright , so I understand what 's {disfmarker} what you got . I don't yet understand {pause} how you would use it . So let me see if I can ask\nGrad A:Well , this is not a working Bayes - net .\nProfessor B:a s Right . No , I understand that , but {disfmarker} but um So , what {disfmarker} Let 's slide back up again and see {disfmarker} start at the {disfmarker} at the bottom and Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop . Yeah . So , you could imagine w Uh , go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something .\nGrad A:Well I {disfmarker} OK , I just {disfmarker} Say what you were gonna say .\nProfessor B:Good , do it !\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor B:No no , go do it .\nGrad A:Uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} No , I was gonna wait until {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Oh , OK . So , so if you {disfmarker} if we made {disfmarker} if we wanted to make it into a {disfmarker} a real uh Bayes - net , that is , you know , with fill {disfmarker} you know , actually f uh , fill it @ @ in , then uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A:So we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the Mode .\nProfessor B:Well , I don't {disfmarker} That 's an issue . So , um {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise .\nProfessor B:Well , here 's the problem . And {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today {disfmarker} is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the Mode thing . And uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Well I {disfmarker} oh yeah , I unders I understand that , I just {disfmarker} uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that .\nProfessor B:Well , i But that 's what we have to do .\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor B:OK , so , so , uh . There {disfmarker} there are a variety of ways of doing it . Uh . Let me just mention something that I don't want to pursue today which is there are technical ways of doing it , uh I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara and {disfmarker} about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes and there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness .\nGrad A:Mmm .\nProfessor B:Uh , so . If you co you could ima and I now I don't know that any of those actually apply in this case , but there is some technology you could try to apply .\nGrad A:So it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that {disfmarker} OK .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Yeah . And , um So .\nGrad A:So in that case , the sum we 'd have {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes . We 'd have the summary nodes like where the things were {disfmarker} I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:So what I was gonna say is {disfmarker} is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally {disfmarker} I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . So , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode , you know , what are the most relevant things .\nGrad A:Mmm .\nProfessor B:And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n {pause} each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics . So that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be , OK ? then you could say \" Aha , let 's have these three factors \" , OK ? and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one .\nGrad A:Mmm .\nProfessor B:And then the question would be if {disfmarker} if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about . So that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor B:given that we 're not gonna screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox Bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that . Um and\nGrad A:So what I kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ?\nProfessor B:\" Eh - eh - eh . \" Yeah .\nGrad A:So that {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Well , mmm , something . I mean , so uh , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around , so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things .\nGrad A:Mmm .\nProfessor B:and , um , I understand where this {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} this is a way of playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector exp uh uh abstraction and {disfmarker} and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Uh , I don't think our friends uh on Wednesday are going to be able to {disfmarker} Well , maybe they will . Well , let me think about whether {disfmarker} whether I think we can present this to them or not . Um , Uh ,\nGrad D:Well , I think this is still , I mean , ad - hoc . This is sort of th the second {vocalsound} version and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} look at this maybe just as a , you know , a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} whatever , UML diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a Bayes - net as John {disfmarker} Johno said .\nGrad A:We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract .\nGrad D:Yeah . But the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the nice thing is that you know , it just is a {disfmarker} is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully\nProfessor B:Alright , well , le let me think about this some more ,\nGrad D:and uh\nProfessor B:and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that {disfmarker} that is helpful to them .\nGrad D:I mean , ultimately we {disfmarker} we may w w we regard this as sort of an exercise in {disfmarker} in thinking about the problem and maybe a first version of uh a module , if you wanna call it that , that you can ask , that you can give input and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you , uh throw the die for you , because um I integrated this into the existing SmartKom system in {disfmarker} in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh {disfmarker} this thing . Close this down . So if this is what M - three - L um will look like and what it 'll give us , um {disfmarker} And a very simple thing . We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:And this {disfmarker} these uh {disfmarker} this changed now only um , um {disfmarker} It 's doing it twice now because it already did it once . Um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is \" Approach \" and could be , you know , more refined uh in many ways .\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm . Good .\nGrad D:Or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place and it will give us then of course an action type of the type \" Enter \" . So this is just based on this one {disfmarker} um , on this one feature , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's about all you can do . And so in the f if this pla if the object type um here is {disfmarker} is a m is a landmark , of course it 'll be um \" Vista \" . And um this is about as much as we can do if we don't w if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify \" OK , if it 's this and this but that is not the case \" , and so forth , it just gets really really messy .\nProfessor B:OK , I 'm sorry . You 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Hmm ?\nProfessor B:It was much too quick for me . OK , so let me see if I understand what you 're saying . So , I {disfmarker} I do understand that uh you can take the M - three - L and add not {disfmarker} and it w and you need to do this , for sure , we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff , and what I think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say \" If it 's of type \" Landmark \" , then you take {disfmarker} you 're gonna take a picture of it . \"\nGrad D:Exactly .\nProfessor B:F full stop , I mean , that 's what you do . Ev - every landmark you take a picture of ,\nGrad D:Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible .\nProfessor B:you enter {disfmarker} You approach . OK . Uh , and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing SmartKom system . And you just did , right ? OK .\nGrad D:Yeah . And it {disfmarker} it would do us no good .\nProfessor B:Ah .\nGrad D:That {disfmarker} Ultimately .\nProfessor B:Well . So , s well , and let 's think about this .\nGrad D:W\nProfessor B:Um , that 's a {disfmarker} that 's another kind of baseline case , that 's another sort of thing \" OK , here 's a {disfmarker} another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this \" . Add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property you have an action , \" pppt ! \" You do that . Um , then the question would be Uh Now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology , OK ? because that 's all {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} all you 're using is this type {disfmarker} the types in the ontology and you 're done .\nGrad D:Hmm ?\nProfessor B:Right ? So we don't {disfmarker} we don't use the discourse , we don't use the context , we don't do any of those things .\nGrad D:No .\nProfessor B:Alright , but that 's {disfmarker} but that 's OK , and I mean it it 's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things . And that 's something the uh SmartKom people themselves would {disfmarker} they 'd say \" Sure , that 's no problem {disfmarker} you know , no problem to add types to the ont \" Right ?\nGrad D:Yeah . No . And this is {disfmarker} just in order to exemplify what {disfmarker} what we can do very , very easily is , um we have this {disfmarker} this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content .\nProfessor B:Hmm .\nGrad D:Now , the content {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} whi which is sort of what {disfmarker} what we see here , which is sort of the Vista , Schema , Source , Path , Goal , whatever .\nProfessor B:Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad D:This will um be um a job to find ways of writing down Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some {disfmarker} some form , and have this be in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in the content , loosely called \" Constructicon \" . And the rules we want to throw away completely . And um {disfmarker} and here is exactly where what 's gonna be replaced with our Bayes - net , which is exactly getting the input feeding into here . This decides whether it 's an whether action {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the Enter , the Vista , or the whatever\nProfessor B:Uh , \" approach \" , you called it , I think this time .\nGrad D:uh Approach um construction should be activated , IE just pasted in .\nProfessor B:That 's what you said {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's fine . Yeah , but {disfmarker} Right . But it 's not construction there , it 's action . Construction is a d is a different story .\nGrad D:Yeah .\nGrad A:Right . This is uh {disfmarker} so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the {disfmarker} for the X - schema ?\nProfessor B:For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} Yes .\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor B:Yeah . So that {disfmarker} that uh i if you had the generalized \" Go \" X - schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters .\nGrad A:Right .\nProfessor B:And then uh , although we haven't worried about this yet , you might wanna worry about something that would go to the GIS and use that to actually get you know , detailed route planning . So , you know , where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that .\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:But that 's not {disfmarker} It 's not the immediate problem .\nGrad A:Right .\nProfessor B:But , presumably that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that functionality 's there when {disfmarker} when we {disfmarker}\nGrad A:So the immediate problem is just deciding w which {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Aspects of the X - schema to add .\nProfessor B:Yeah , so the pro The immediate problem is {disfmarker} is back t t to what you were {disfmarker} what you are doing with the belief - net .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nProfessor B:You know , uh what are we going to use to make this decision {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ?\nProfessor B:Yeah . Right . Right . Well , that {disfmarker} that actually is relatively easy in this case .\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor B:The harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ? And that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that 's the hardest problem . So , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the {disfmarker} what the person says and the context and the ontology . The h So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is {disfmarker} is\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor B:where are you gonna {disfmarker} how are you gonna g get this information . Um , and that 's {disfmarker} so , getting back to here , uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we {disfmarker} we don't want all the com\nGrad A:There 's just too many factors right now .\nProfessor B:too many factors if we {disfmarker} if we allow them to just go combinatorially .\nGrad A:Right .\nProfessor B:So we wanna think about which ones we really care about and what they really most depend on , and can we c you know , clean this {disfmarker} this up to the point where it {disfmarker}\nGrad A:So what we really wanna do i cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna b make it {disfmarker} expand it out into more layers basically ?\nProfessor B:Right . We might . Uh , I mean that {disfmarker} that 's certainly one thing we can do . Uh , it 's true that the way you have this , a lot of the times you have {disfmarker} what you 're having is the values rather than the variable . So uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Right . So instead of in instead it should really be {disfmarker} just be \" intention \" as a node instead of \" intention business \" or \" intention tour \" .\nProfessor B:OK ? So you {disfmarker} Yeah , right , and then it would have values , uh , \" Tour \" , \" Business \" , or uh \" Hurried \" .\nGrad A:Right .\nProfessor B:But then {disfmarker} but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters .\nGrad A:Right .\nProfessor B:I mean , it 's fine . You know , we have to {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's iterative . We 're gonna have to work with it some .\nGrad A:I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention and the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Well , you {disfmarker} you could do that . And it 's perfectly OK {pause} to uh insist that {disfmarker} that , you know , th um , they add up to one , but that there 's uh {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that it doesn't have to be one zero zero .\nGrad A:Mmm . OK .\nProfessor B:OK . So you could have the conditional p So the {disfmarker} each of these things is gonna be a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a probability . So whenever there 's a choice , uh {disfmarker} so like landmark - ness and usefulness ,\nGrad A:Well , see I don't think those would be mutually {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:OK {disfmarker}\nGrad A:it seems like something could both be {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Absolutely right .\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor B:And so that you might want to then have those b Th - Then they may have to be separate . They may not be able to be values of the same variable .\nGrad D:Object type , mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:So that 's {disfmarker} but again , this is {disfmarker} this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through . Right . It 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's great {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is , you know , as one step toward uh {disfmarker} toward where we wanna go .\nGrad D:Also it strikes me that we {disfmarker} we m may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a {disfmarker} uh , a specification for some interface , here that um takes the normal M - three - L , looks at it . Then we discussed in our pre - edu {disfmarker} EDU meeting um how to ask the ontology , what to ask the ontology um the fact that we can pretend we have one , make a dummy until we get the real one , and so um we {disfmarker} we may wanna decide we can do this from here , but we also could do it um you know if we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a belief - net interface . So the belief - net takes as input , a vector , right ? of stuff . And it {disfmarker} Yeah . And um it Output is whatever , as well . But this information is just M - three - L , and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology and we want to look up some more stuff in the {disfmarker} maybe we want to ask the real world , maybe you want to look something up in the GRS , but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff . Based on we {disfmarker} we have uh {disfmarker} I was just made some examples from the ontology and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a building and it has doors and stuff like this , but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history , \" were any of these things that {disfmarker} that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? \" ,\nProfessor B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:\" were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned ? \" ,\nGrad C:Right .\nGrad D:and so forth , and maybe draw some inferences on that . So this may be a {disfmarker} a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector , that we feed into the belief - net ,\nProfessor B:Yeah . I think that 's {disfmarker} I think that 's exactly right .\nGrad D:and then {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:There will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process . Yeah ,\nGrad D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:no I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's just fine . Uh , yeah . So they 'll {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} presumably there 'll be a thread or process or something that \" Agent \" , yeah , \" Agent \" , whatever you wan wanna say , yeah , that uh is rule - driven , and can {disfmarker} can uh {disfmarker} can do things like that . And um there 's an issue about whether there will be {disfmarker} that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision , so it probably will . My guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information , run it through a {disfmarker} a c this belief - net that {disfmarker} turn a crank in the belief - net , that 'll come out with s uh more {disfmarker} another vector , OK , which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end . So you now know what you 're gonna do and that may actually involve getting more information . So on once you pull that out , it could be that that says \" Ah ! Now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else . \" OK ? Now that we know that it 's a bus trip , OK ? we didn't {disfmarker} We didn't need to know beforehand , uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but {disfmarker} but now that we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:So I think that 's OK .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm . So this is actually , s if {disfmarker} if we were to build something that is um , and , uh , I had one more thing , the {disfmarker} it needs to do {disfmarker} Yeah . I think we {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can come up with a {disfmarker} a code for a module that we call the \" cognitive dispatcher \" , which does nothing ,\nProfessor B:OK .\nGrad D:but it looks of complect object trees and decides how {disfmarker} are there parts missing that need to be filled out , there 's {disfmarker} this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do and then collect uh sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together . So maybe this is actually some {disfmarker} some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it , and uh get this part ,\nProfessor B:Oh , OK . Uh .\nGrad D:then . Yeah .\nProfessor B:I confess , I 'm still not completely comfortable with the overall story . Um . I i This {disfmarker} this is not a complaint , this is a promise to do more work . So I 'm gonna hafta think about it some more . Um . In particular {disfmarker} see what we 'd like to do , and {disfmarker} and this has been implicit in the discussion , is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of re - use . So . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source {disfmarker} source , paths and goals , and nnn {comment} all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks . And that {disfmarker} uh there 's {disfmarker} there 's some {disfmarker} some important generalities that you 're getting , so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re - do it . And I don't yet see how that goes . Alright .\nGrad D:There 're no primitives upon which {pause} uh\nProfessor B:u u What are the primitives , and how do you break this {disfmarker}\nGrad D:yeah .\nProfessor B:So I y I 'm just {disfmarker} just there saying eee {comment} well you {disfmarker} I know how to do any individual case , right ? but I don't yet {disfmarker} see what 's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep uh cognitive linguistics to {pause} get powerful generalizations . And\nGrad D:Yep .\nProfessor B:um\nGrad D:Maybe we sho should we a add then the \" what 's this ? \" domain ? N I mean , we have to \" how do I get to X \" . Then we also have the \" what 's this ? \" domain , where we get some slightly different {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Could . Uh .\nGrad C:Right .\nGrad D:Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them \" intentions \" anymore .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad D:So he {disfmarker} he dislikes the term .\nProfessor B:Well , I {disfmarker} I don't like the term either , so I have n i uh i i y w i i It uh {disfmarker}\nGrad D:But um , I 'm sure the \" what 's this ? \" questions also create some interesting X - schema aspects .\nProfessor B:Could be . I 'm not a {disfmarker} I 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task ,\nGrad D:So .\nProfessor B:I mean , eventually we 're gonna want a whole range of them .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Uh ,\nGrad C:That 's right .\nProfessor B:I 'm just saying that I 'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this . I just at the moment don't know .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:H No . Well , no the Bayes {disfmarker} the Bayes - nets {disfmarker} The Bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision . But what I 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different Bayes - nets , be the {disfmarker} uh general . So that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , and there 's a language for talking about trajectors , you shouldn't have to do that differently for uh uh going to something , than for circling it , for uh telling someone else how to go there ,\nGrad D:Getting out of {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:whatever it is . So that {disfmarker} that , the {disfmarker} the decision processes are gonna be different What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs . So all sorts of different tasks {pause} and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on . And that 's {disfmarker} that would be the really pretty result . And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom , i that {disfmarker} that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent {disfmarker} you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff , in independent of whether it {disfmarker} about {disfmarker} what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way . So that 's the {disfmarker} You might . You might . You might be able to {disfmarker} to uh say that this i this is the kind of construction in which the {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} Let 's say there 's a uh cont there {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container . OK . So just from this local construction you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information . And that may effect the way you process everything else . So if you say \" how do I get into the castle \" OK , then um {disfmarker} Or , you know , \" what is there in the castle \" or {disfmarker} so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff . Independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:Alright , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the thesis level\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B:uh {disfmarker}\nGrad D:It 's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs because they 're really fancy then , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for these kinds of analysis . But uh .\nProfessor B:Well , you have prepositional phrases that {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Yeah , but they 're {disfmarker} they 're easier for parsers .\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad D:Parsers can pick those up but {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker} with the spatial adverbs , they have a tough time . Because the {disfmarker} mean the semantics are very complex in that .\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad D:OK , yeah ? I had one more {pause} thing . I don't remember . I just forgot it again . No . Oh yeah , b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to {disfmarker} to throw this away and {disfmarker} and replace it with something else , or whatever , so that we have {disfmarker} so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're talking about that are independent of the problem , that generalize over those problems , and are oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever um belief - net , or \" X \" that we may use for the decision making , ultimately . Should be decoupled , yeah . OK .\nProfessor B:Right . So , are we gonna be meeting here from now on ? I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm happy to do that . We {disfmarker} we had talked about it , cuz you have th th the display and everything , that seems fine .\nGrad D:Yeah , um , Liz also asks whether we 're gonna have presentations every time . I don't think we will need to do that but it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad D:so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Oh yeah . No I {disfmarker} I think it 's worth it to ass to meet here to bring this , and assume that something may come up that we wanna look at .\nGrad D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:I mean . Why not .\nGrad D:And um . Yeah , that was my {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:She was good . Litonya was good .\nGrad D:Yeah ? The uh {disfmarker} um , she w she was definitely good in the sense that she {disfmarker} she showed us some of the weaknesses\nProfessor B:Right .\nGrad D:and um also the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the fact that she was a real subject you know , is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}\nProfessor B:Right . Yeah , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} yeah and {disfmarker} and she took it seriously and stuff l No , it was great .\nGrad D:Yeah .\nProfessor B:Yeah .\nGrad D:So I think that um {disfmarker} I mean , w Looking {disfmarker} just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem , for example , is , you know , she actually m said {disfmarker} you know , she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff . Nuh ? So this is definitely interesting , and {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Yeah , right .\nGrad D:Um , and in the other case , where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti , also , of course , not in the sentence \" How do you get there ? \" was pretty standard . Nuh ? except that there was a nice anaphora , you know , for pointing at what she talked about before , and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls , so\nGrad C:Right .\nGrad D:Actually , you 'd need a lot of world knowledge . This would have been a classical um uh \" Tango \" , actually . Um , because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside ,\nGrad C:Yeah .\nGrad D:but OK . So the mistake {comment} would have make a mistake {disfmarker} the system would have made a mistake here .\nGrad C:Yep .\nProfessor B:Click ? Alright .\n",
        "summary": "The team began the meeting by discussing the logistics of setting up the interface for data collection. Some members ran a trial of it earlier and found someone who would make a suitable wizard. The team shared concern about how they would recruit non-university student participants. Grad D introduced the team to the second iteration of the bayes-net model and its schemas. Then, the discussion moved onto controlling the size of the bayes-net as it would otherwise be based on too much information. The team ended the meeting by delving into how the method of creating a Bayes-net in different scenarios could itself be abstracted, i.e. narrowing the input and output factors and the intermediate representation.",

Yeah , my name is Francina . And I'm uh an user interface {disfmarker} my role is uh {disfmarker} the main responsibility is user interface .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And my role is to design uh a television remote control .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing:And I'm a marketing person . I wanna figure out how to sell them .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . And your name is ?\nMarketing:My name is Eileen .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui . Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the {vocalsound} technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design .\nProject Manager:Very good . And as you already know I am Betty . I am the project manager for today . So why don't we look at the presentation {vocalsound} to see what we really are supposed to do . {vocalsound} Um .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training {disfmarker} well , the tools are , I think , we already {disfmarker} I guess the tool is really our {disfmarker} the computer , as far as I can see .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . Um , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Um . Here is what this thing should be . This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . Uh should be original {vocalsound} , trendy , and , of course , user friendly .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So maybe you wanna make some notes of that .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:All right . {vocalsound} Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um . That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . Detailed design , same thing basically .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay so {disfmarker} Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Functional , conception and detailed .\nProject Manager:I can't write with this thing . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Maybe we should redesign it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , okay . All right ? Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . You wanna go Eileen and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , I'll see what I can do .\nProject Manager:Whether you {disfmarker} without hanging yourself . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:See if I r See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And remember you have to press so it works .\nMarketing:So that it will record okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um uh um traditional kitty cat .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Fat , a fat cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I've a very fat cat .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And it likes to sit like that .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:And you're Francine , right ? Would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ?\nUser Interface:Yes , I'm Francina . Yes , sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:In {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Am I supposed to wipe off that or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No , no . No , that's okay .\nUser Interface:No , Okay .\nMarketing:okay .\nProject Manager:I don't know , we'll get to that later .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:What should I draw ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Snake .\nUser Interface:I'm going to draw a snake . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:How does it look like ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:the market range unlimited meaning international\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:and the production cost should not exceed {disfmarker} hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Profit . Um is fifty mm .\nProject Manager:So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design {vocalsound} to materials , cost , etcetera . Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ?\nMarketing:Oops .\nProject Manager:I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em {disfmarker} we use 'em , right , everyday .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? Would you like it to be smaller , bigger ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly {disfmarker} better marked buttons , you know , things like that ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Small , right . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Audio player . Oh . Okay .\nProject Manager:So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically .\nUser Interface:Yes , exactly Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Divides us {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} At um twelve fifty Euros per {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well .\nMarketing:Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We certainly can try to {disfmarker} I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .\nProject Manager:It should be something new {disfmarker} it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have .\nMarketing:That's right .\nProject Manager:Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , of course .\nUser Interface:Yeah , design should be , yeah {disfmarker} it should be different . All the {disfmarker} almost all the remotes {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should {disfmarker} different colours or materials or you know .\nUser Interface:Yes , exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe ten {disfmarker} I do yeah , colours\nUser Interface:Are different shapes .\nIndustrial Designer:and al shapes also . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah of course yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That is true ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And and they {disfmarker} suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my {vocalsound} my remote control yeah ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal .\nMarketing:So some {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , some beep or something like that ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Or a b\nMarketing:Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink .\nIndustrial Designer:so that we can go {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So if lost {disfmarker} If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know .\nUser Interface:Should ha\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:A fluorescent signal , yeah .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is .\nProject Manager:Exactly , I mean just {vocalsound} that's what I'm saying .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . May not be beep .\nProject Manager:I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light .\nMarketing:And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond {disfmarker} what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?\nProject Manager:Okay , my {disfmarker} my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it {disfmarker} a light s sensors , you know ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep ,\nMarketing:Okay so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , probably {disfmarker} yeah , probably it's a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So the light sensor would activate the signal .\nProject Manager:That's right . You know there would be {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:but I think they only work to certain degree and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it .\nProject Manager:What with {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , of course , that didn't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Then , in that case {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly .\nIndustrial Designer:I i we can't do it .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah well , but then those people {disfmarker} we can't help everybody . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I mean it could be on {disfmarker} well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:um {vocalsound} ,\nProject Manager:Okay we have uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:you know , well {disfmarker} maybe we have to move along , okay .\nProject Manager:yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , good point .\nProject Manager:Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . I think you all {disfmarker} did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice um\nIndustrial Designer:Me yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ {disfmarker} uh who is this ? The industrial designer {disfmarker} That's you .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical .\nProject Manager:Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design .\nProject Manager:Then {disfmarker} And then the technical funct you are the technical function ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , functional design ,\nProject Manager:so so you are the working design .\nIndustrial Designer:and you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So you have a working design and then a functional design .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea . And , of course , price . That it , that it , that the price is a good price . I mean , the price is given , but , that was {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .\nProject Manager:That's right . That's right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah . So um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . Um any questions at this point ? Or uh suggestions ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I think {disfmarker} basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , even I have .\nMarketing:How about you people ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , even I have , I think , yeah .\nMarketing:Really ? Okay . 'Kay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , so let's see .\nMarketing:Alright , well uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . And see what we can come up with .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , very good .\nProject Manager:Okay ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\n",

Um alright .\nMarketing:Uh , uh , um .\nProject Manager:I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . Go ahead .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um {vocalsound} sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . That's about it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right . {vocalsound} I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm {disfmarker} I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh the detailed design {disfmarker} in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a {disfmarker} not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . {vocalsound} Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . And w uh {vocalsound} well um functional design um . Um do we have {disfmarker} um any ideas of of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just {disfmarker} you know , change channels is its main function .\nProject Manager:So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or {disfmarker} I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?\nUser Interface:Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:for {disfmarker} could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like {disfmarker} I don't actually know . {gap} But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ?\nProject Manager:I I think {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , r universal remote .\nUser Interface:Ye yeah .\nProject Manager:Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control ,\nMarketing:Huh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Ours too . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think we're all in the same boat here . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature .\nMarketing:Mm . Ch\nProject Manager:So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh\nMarketing:Like a tracking device ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:like a tracking device or or like a a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh you can get those key {disfmarker} well you could whistle or make a noise\nProject Manager:It makes a noise ,\nUser Interface:and it'd beep .\nProject Manager:there's a button on the T_V_ that you press\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , mm .\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:Be good .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Do we want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Just long .\nProject Manager:so they're kinda like long and rectangular .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Do we want something crazy ?\nUser Interface:Black usually .\nProject Manager:You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Lot more modern .\nProject Manager:A m a modern {disfmarker} so our remote should be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think so . Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Maybe like user-friendly , like a little\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .\nUser Interface:People {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another {disfmarker} if it was in a ball ,\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so there are always the {disfmarker} some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . What are we gonna build that thing out of ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} yeah , so we want it to be sturdy ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:then it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um {disfmarker} So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um easy to find . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What else {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so .\nMarketing:Mm . Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:That's more on the research end , but {disfmarker} the marketing .\nProject Manager:So marketing , you know , how {disfmarker} maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing {vocalsound} remote control out there .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences ,\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting .\nUser Interface:Ye Small .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball ,\nUser Interface:{gap} I'd {disfmarker} I could draw sorta the ball idea .\nProject Manager:you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located .\nUser Interface:My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you {disfmarker} this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle {disfmarker} Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that {disfmarker} if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something {disfmarker} maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But yeah .\nMarketing:Futuristic . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That was that was a sorta simple idea I had\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:and then you know you could {gap} about {disfmarker} Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ?\nIndustrial Designer:Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um {disfmarker} the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Maybe f yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . Yeah . The idea {disfmarker} it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's that's {vocalsound} interesting of course ,\nUser Interface:that was just one idea though .\nIndustrial Designer:but that's of course a weak point , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:How would we go about um making you know {disfmarker} getting rid of our weak points ? What {disfmarker} I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Not to put you on the spot ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} E No no ,\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:uh uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:What did you say your title was again ?\nIndustrial Designer:N n\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You're the the Industrial Designer .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so i b well ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:the point is that {vocalsound} well maybe {disfmarker} I dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so .\nUser Interface:Well I I suppose that things become {gap} design . But I mean i\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah .\nProject Manager:It's not new , it's not innovative , it's {disfmarker} you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it's it's stable um .\nMarketing:'Kay , I'll draw something . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So if {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:What ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:no , go ahead .\nMarketing:My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:l so . But maybe {disfmarker} I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know . {vocalsound} That's my idea .\nUser Interface:I think definitely doing something different\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:is a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like {vocalsound} suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .\nProject Manager:Something with a grip .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , with a grip .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Because even {disfmarker} I suppose even with the ball\nUser Interface:It still might be hard to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .\nProject Manager:it might not be the easiest to hold onto um .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:So perhaps the the joystick {disfmarker} the the keyboard idea might work better .\nUser Interface:Like {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} True .\nUser Interface:It's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's fine .\nProject Manager:Uh {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You're the boss , you're {vocalsound} allowed to .\nIndustrial Designer:Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . So for that there's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , so\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:unfortunately we've got about five minutes here {vocalsound} to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . Let's see here . What if we had what if we had not only um {disfmarker} say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . So the grip is {disfmarker} No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then {vocalsound} flat uh {disfmarker} And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want .\nIndustrial Designer:The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?\nProject Manager:Mm , that's true .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it's {disfmarker} don't make it too stable {vocalsound} uh .\nProject Manager:So we don't have it flip open . We just have a ball {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then .\nIndustrial Designer:To the other design .\nProject Manager:Okay , so then we forget the ball .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It looks cool . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Looks cool though .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It looks cool , but it's really not {disfmarker} it's not functional um .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {vocalsound} functional .\nProject Manager:So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um {disfmarker} Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you {vocalsound} had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Course then it's it's like the rectangular {vocalsound} again , only with a couple of jutting out points . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Right .\nProject Manager:But it's one-handed um .\nIndustrial Designer:Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:right ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not {disfmarker} probably not get a get away from some longer design .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:You know , all\nProject Manager:because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do .\nIndustrial Designer:that dif batteries {disfmarker} right , and {disfmarker} Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back .\nProject Manager:Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work .\nIndustrial Designer:I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .\nProject Manager:More expensive and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Course you can do that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or {disfmarker} if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the {vocalsound} the buttons and stuff ,\nProject Manager:True .\nIndustrial Designer:but um it's rather about an instinctual thing ,\nUser Interface:Put it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of {disfmarker} or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .\nUser Interface:Even if you designed it {disfmarker} in some {disfmarker} in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead ,\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish .\nProject Manager:Are we out of time ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some {disfmarker} Are good ideas , what are not .\nIndustrial Designer:Let's .\nUser Interface:Does it say {disfmarker} what does it say for n\nIndustrial Designer:Obviously {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .\nProject Manager:Uh . Must finish now , so .\nUser Interface:T\nProject Manager:And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:Great .\nProject Manager:Okay . And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next {vocalsound} time around , be a little bit more prepared .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And uh alright , good meeting .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "Project Manager introduced a new remote control project. The team started to know each other by introducing their roles in this project. Project Manager then invited everyone to raise ideas about the remote. Their discussion included its versatility, anti-loss design and possible appearance, but there was no final decision on these matters. The team agreed that the remote control should be one-handed, user-friendly and globally attractive. In addition, they noticed that these ideas should be realized under the price target and balance the stability and design sense of the remote control.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} Okay ? Good afternoon . Hope you have good lunch .\nUser Interface:Hi .\nIndustrial Designer:Afternoon . Yeah , we had falafel .\nProject Manager:Oh . Nice . And you ?\nUser Interface:Uh , yes , I had something similar but non-vegetarian .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . So today is um our third meeting . It will be about the conceptual design {vocalsound} uh . If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings um . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us . So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts ?\nMarketing:Okay , {gap} .\nProject Manager:So marketing .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So you are {disfmarker} you saved your y your presentation somewhere ?\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:So you're four ?\nMarketing:Four , yeah .\nProject Manager:Which is trend watch . {vocalsound} Okay . Mr Marketing Experts .\nMarketing:Yeah that's me .\nProject Manager:So {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh . Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users . Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current the n current trends ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah ? Okay . {vocalsound} {gap} Okay . {vocalsound} Well wha {vocalsound} what I found {disfmarker} um can you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Next slide ? Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Thank you . What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most {disfmarker} what they what they find more more interesting , more {disfmarker} or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So now more more cool aspect , ma more {disfmarker} a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with {disfmarker} instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Uh also {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} in in Euro in in Paris and and {vocalsound} Milan the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of {gap} uh of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's {vocalsound} it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:And also {vocalsound} in the in the U_S_A_ the the current {disfmarker} the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . Spongy means eponge ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What what do you mean by {vocalsound} fruit and vegetables and spongy ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What {disfmarker} you mean clothe\nIndustrial Designer:Spongy means it it's like sp\nMarketing:Fruit vegetables is the the new {disfmarker} have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ?\nUser Interface:No , I missed that one .\nMarketing:Yeah , I I didn't miss an {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .\nUser Interface:Oh , they're {disfmarker} okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay .\nMarketing:No no , not not yet , not yet .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana ,\nMarketing:So te textu textures , yeah .\nUser Interface:just maybe {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Vegetable textures and all this kind .\nProject Manager:Drawings of bananas .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay and {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ?\nProject Manager:Well so this is in the next slide certainly .\nMarketing:Uh no no , it's not .\nProject Manager:It's not ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So which fruit are you thinking of ?\nMarketing:And {disfmarker} Um .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may {disfmarker} could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But yeah it it depends on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Means buttons are in the shape of fruits ,\nMarketing:Yeah maybe the shape the shape {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:buttons are in the frape {disfmarker} shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that .\nMarketing:No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different .\nProject Manager:Apple for channel one . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend\nUser Interface:So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:but {disfmarker} For instance , yeah . African or as an elephant ?\nIndustrial Designer:That we can discuss afterwards {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker} okay ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is .\nMarketing:Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices\nUser Interface:To fruit ?\nMarketing:and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was {vocalsound} was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control .\nUser Interface:But is it uh is fruit cool ?\nMarketing:What ?\nProject Manager:That's a question .\nMarketing:What ?\nUser Interface:Is fruit cool ?\nMarketing:Yeah ? Uh {disfmarker} Is the new trend of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , {vocalsound} imagi {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No I think we we should think about a a shape with it {disfmarker} a device with a shape of some {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ?\nUser Interface:Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of ,\nIndustrial Designer:Banana .\nUser Interface:a cucumber .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Maybe too long .\nUser Interface:I dunno .\nMarketing:Or m\nUser Interface:Maybe . Too green .\nMarketing:Maybe . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So , but I mean you also have to {disfmarker} you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and {disfmarker} you know .\nProject Manager:A banana .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's , it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like {gap} on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't th it will be rolling a lot .\nMarketing:Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough {disfmarker} a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not .\nUser Interface:Well , this is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think {disfmarker} Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than {disfmarker} rather than the\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker} So you you you suggest to go f\nMarketing:new inputs and also it's {disfmarker} I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need {disfmarker} buying control remote , buying uh\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} S so you're simply\nMarketing:more things . It's not so simple .\nProject Manager:you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons {disfmarker} with only a few buttons .\nMarketing:For instance , yeah . Yeah for for for {disfmarker} given an an example yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay good . So maybe you can go ahead ?\nMarketing:Yeah no , it's what I already said .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Thanks . Um . Okay , I'll give the floor . So you are User Interface guy . So you're three ?\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:And it's this one .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Go for it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yep . Okay . So . S next uh slide . Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:But it's just a speaker right ?\nUser Interface:It's {disfmarker} no , what it is , it's it's very {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's not a microphone .\nUser Interface:It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it's got a little chip and it allows you t\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Actually I'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it {gap} just to speak to you .\nUser Interface:Well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . Sample sensor sample speaker . It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . So , I mean , you know ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:But basically the thing is , we have this technology available\nIndustrial Designer:In-house .\nUser Interface:in-house . So , um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so um it it {disfmarker} but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it , {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I {disfmarker} there's something that I {disfmarker} unclear really understanding . Is this a technology that recognize keywords {disfmarker} speech keywords ?\nUser Interface:It's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , you say {disfmarker} the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um {disfmarker} well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ?\nProject Manager:And it's just to , it's just to playback something ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . So actually that was a bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah . So this is not s really to do to to do control .\nUser Interface:Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an\nProject Manager:Yeah . This is just more like a poi pois yeah .\nUser Interface:It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing ,\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So it it's c uh it it\nMarketing:Yeah but you can u\nProject Manager:it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to {disfmarker} we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh\nUser Interface:Completely pointless yeah .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} yeah comp {vocalsound} completely pointless {vocalsound} for the inter for {disfmarker} from the interaction point of v point of view {gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah but the {disfmarker} can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ?\nUser Interface:Well yeah , that's the thing , if {disfmarker} you can but {vocalsound} you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah . So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that would be some development work .\nProject Manager:So this is out of discussion . So if if if it is something that you can {disfmarker} we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:M Mando .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Banana-mando .\nProject Manager:No this is mm banana-bando , yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Banana-man {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Banana-mando yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh then it could be cool yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah okay , let's go ahead .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um , yeah . So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our {vocalsound} potential funky-looking uh remote control {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It doesn't look like a banana at all .\nUser Interface:Well , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:um , so at the moment it's more of a box focus .\nProject Manager:But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know ,\nIndustrial Designer:Stable thing , that's right . To have {gap} ,\nUser Interface:I think everyone has has agreed that it's {disfmarker} that it could be quite a useful um thing , so .\nIndustrial Designer:mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:because it's it's {disfmarker} the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and {disfmarker} well {vocalsound}\nMarketing:What's a turbo button ?\nUser Interface:so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh {disfmarker} Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing {gap} .\nMarketing:It con it controls the speed ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going {disfmarker} if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana\nProject Manager:It's enough .\nUser Interface:and it's still very {disfmarker} it may even be for most {disfmarker} for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , um {vocalsound} you know , what other buttons do we want ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I mean we could have {disfmarker} well , I guess you need an on and off switch ,\nProject Manager:Switch on . Yeah .\nUser Interface:but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing .\nMarketing:Yeah . So sounds crazy . I like crazy ideas .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's why you're a marketing guru . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing .\nUser Interface:Well , that's the thing , as {disfmarker} have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five Euro ?\nProject Manager:I think that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro .\nMarketing:I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so .\nProject Manager:No we can we can't use that .\nMarketing:You {disfmarker} we can ? We can't .\nProject Manager:We can't use that to to comman co communicate ,\nIndustrial Designer:Communicate .\nProject Manager:it's just a thing {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer:It's one way .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:No ?\nUser Interface:But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to to recognize {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:It's not a lot one hundred templates ,\nUser Interface:Mm . Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our {gap} can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning .\nMarketing:it's not {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Ah , it's designed for a cof {vocalsound} okay . Is it design for a coffee machine ?\nUser Interface:Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe you could ask your {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} you could ask the engineering department if we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . A good good good thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:You want to g to move to your slides ?\nUser Interface:But uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's right , yeah .\nProject Manager:You're finished ?\nUser Interface:Well I just I just made the point , I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment .\nProject Manager:Yeah I think so .\nUser Interface:But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition {disfmarker} the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here\nProject Manager:Exactly yeah .\nUser Interface:but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing ,\nUser Interface:It's speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out .\nUser Interface:It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh , good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That's right .\nProject Manager:Very good .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , let's move on . So you're two ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So this is going to be about the component design .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your {disfmarker} if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t\nUser Interface:I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So there should {disfmarker} we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them .\nUser Interface:So , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is .\nUser Interface:Okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ?\nIndustrial Designer:So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:it'll bring the cost down\nUser Interface:Although , you know , wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option ,\nIndustrial Designer:and anyway it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on .\nProject Manager:Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Wooden cases {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well it depends , I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken ,\nProject Manager:Yeah but the components inside .\nUser Interface:it's the inside . Yeah but inside you know you could have {disfmarker} you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Very {disfmarker} too expensive to do .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And also uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well .\nProject Manager:Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood .\nUser Interface:That's true , but are we set on the banana idea ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well it look like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Actually\nProject Manager:it looks like you are all targeting that\nMarketing:I was thinking that the\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:yeah ?\nMarketing:the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy .\nProject Manager:Yes it is .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Is it an e apple which has {disfmarker}\nMarketing:it's not a fruit it's a vegetable .\nUser Interface:It's like a pumpkin or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah ? Pumpkin .\nMarketing:Green .\nProject Manager:Green .\nUser Interface:Green .\nProject Manager:Um um um , yes I see .\nUser Interface:What does it taste like ?\nMarketing:And you put in the salad .\nProject Manager:Pep pepperoni .\nUser Interface:Ah yeah ,\nMarketing:Um\nUser Interface:is it {disfmarker} what's it in French ?\nProject Manager:Poivron .\nMarketing:Oui c'est ca\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh pepper .\nMarketing:Pepper .\nProject Manager:But um they do d\nMarketing:And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:No , I mean in a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's not re it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} like with a banana you can have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:you you think it's really fancy and fun ? You think that young people that are {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I'm sure it's fun . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . More than a banana ?\nMarketing:But banana is not so handy ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum .\nMarketing:I think that's handier .\nUser Interface:But {gap} like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and just roll it back and forth like that ,\nProject Manager:It's kind it's kind of {disfmarker} it's more uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but with uh {disfmarker} I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to {vocalsound} to put the controls .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay let's move on .\nMarketing:Yeah you're right .\nProject Manager:So time is running , let's move on .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just {disfmarker} and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , we can go to the next slide . Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . So we can have regular chip for control . Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . And uh regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .\nUser Interface:So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It could be a beep kind of thing .\nUser Interface:Okay , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that .\nUser Interface:Okay . So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?\nIndustrial Designer:That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . It should be {disfmarker} whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:As {disfmarker} or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside .\nIndustrial Designer:so that {disfmarker} That's right . Okay . Yeah . So these these were the component selection and these things . We can go to the next slide . And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device {disfmarker} wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .\nUser Interface:Although , if {disfmarker} It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Of fruits .\nUser Interface:Cause that , you know , that {disfmarker} sometimes people like to collect um you know things that {disfmarker} of a similar type .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:S objects .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Remotes {disfmarker} objects , okay .\nProject Manager:Crazy objects .\nMarketing:I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits .\nUser Interface:Well , {vocalsound} you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place .\nMarketing:No but I think just one fruit to control everything .\nUser Interface:Like a power fruit .\nMarketing:A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and we should have it on the remote .\nProject Manager:Okay , good .\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control .\nIndustrial Designer:So you're having a basis station . Okay . Your {disfmarker} usually your remote sits on that . So you {disfmarker} and it's {disfmarker} that's why it can have chargeable batteries . Now let's say {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station .\nProject Manager:Bu it's it's {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Basis station is with the thing .\nProject Manager:You s you you {gap} thing .\nIndustrial Designer:It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think that's a pretty handy feature .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think it's kind of {disfmarker} people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh this is {disfmarker} basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right . But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:So component cost is going to be the least . Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly .\nUser Interface:Okay . I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I {disfmarker} this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like {disfmarker} it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana ,\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . And um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . {vocalsound} For better {disfmarker} want of a better word\nProject Manager:You think that yellow it's kitsch .\nUser Interface:you know ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well , you know , I don I don't know how many peop\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .\nMarketing:Yeah . No , I I {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:A {disfmarker} yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:O otherwise {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Maybe li like that .\nIndustrial Designer:It's neither a banana nor a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , like this colour this colour {disfmarker} Maybe , you know , maybe {disfmarker} like still in the shape of a banana .\nProject Manager:Roughly .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No , exactly .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Exactly . Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know {disfmarker} because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make {disfmarker} um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay . Let's move on .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh going to the last slide .\nProject Manager:Uh uh {disfmarker} yeah . Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Go for it .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Well no , not not you , you can finish your slides before {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay , so . Anyway , users'll be {disfmarker} so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes .\nProject Manager:Mm {vocalsound} okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So that was very {disfmarker} I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:That's it .\nProject Manager:That's all ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay , so mm {vocalsound} so well done for the presentations . So we need to take some de decisions about um {vocalsound} about what we're going to do .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:and uh where Superman go banana and uh {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order {disfmarker} not to lost the um the device ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I do I don't remember you call it ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's right . The basis station . That's right .\nProject Manager:Basis station , yeah . Uh so um {vocalsound} so we're going for a stylish banana shape .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so , I guess you wanna hold {disfmarker} like the way {disfmarker} the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than {disfmarker} 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor .\nProject Manager:Yeah , right .\nUser Interface:So you know , so if you have like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What about what about this shape ? More or less .\nProject Manager:We\nIndustrial Designer:There's less space on this to put with the buttons .\nProject Manager:I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , but how many buttons do we need ?\nProject Manager:the the starting is good but it could {disfmarker} it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult {disfmarker} if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . So ti time is running ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh what about a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:we have to we have to we have to to move forward . So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So we have this .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We have a a basis um , how do you call it {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer:The base station .\nProject Manager:A base station .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We'll have a base station extra uh on the side .\nUser Interface:{gap} okay , so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right , yeah , we need that , yeah .\nProject Manager:We need b R_F_ to beep .\nUser Interface:Okay , so it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So we {disfmarker} that means we need a button on th on the on the basis .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Basis station .\nProject Manager:Basis station , thank you . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Alright , so we need uh {disfmarker} okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Can you go quickly please ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} So we are going to add uh also um you {disfmarker} as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , which {disfmarker} I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device ,\nIndustrial Designer:Turbo button .\nProject Manager:Yeah , on the th yeah , maybe here .\nUser Interface:so you have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance .\nUser Interface:Yes . Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here .\nProject Manager:And and you have two wheels .\nUser Interface:So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel .\nProject Manager:Okay right . Good . So no L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:And , uh {disfmarker} No L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:Okay great . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} Very good .\nUser Interface:Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh for the remote ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh , just the switch ,\nIndustrial Designer:Remotes don't have power on off switch .\nProject Manager:no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . Uh so you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . S no , that'll be controlled by the {disfmarker} those buttons'll be there already , yeah .\nMarketing:What a\nUser Interface:Where ?\nIndustrial Designer:Means on the remote .\nProject Manager:On the side .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this .\nUser Interface:Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote in the first place , you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , yeah . That's that's another issue which I didn't think of .\nUser Interface:Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .\nMarketing:What about {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? I can't remember ,\nIndustrial Designer:Twenty five .\nProject Manager:Twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer:Twelve point five is the profit on one .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh forty th four . Point point four million ?\nMarketing:Four millions ?\nUser Interface:Four point four million .\nIndustrial Designer:Point four million .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's a lot of fruit .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} In the market .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} What about a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . So . Well . No . Time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:The next step is to go for {vocalsound} {disfmarker} to f is to go to uh to building a prototype , based on this , okay ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay ?\nMarketing:I wo what about adding the {disfmarker} this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying {gap} volume up volume down ?\nProject Manager:It's too difficult .\nMarketing:It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few {disfmarker} five words .\nProject Manager:It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it's {disfmarker} in the next prototype so let's skip it .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:For the future prototypes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one .\nUser Interface:That can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah , honour the fruit .\nMarketing:Plus plus , okay . Maybe objective banana ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Thanks very much . We'll see n next meeting . Bye .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So meeting's over ?\nUser Interface:Yep . We have to go design the prototype .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay . Okay . Thank you .\nProject Manager:Thank you .\nMarketing:Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:The problem is after all this meeting there is {gap} {vocalsound} {gap}\n",
        "summary": "Project Manager started meeting on the conceptual design of the remote control. Marketing gave a presentation on the preference of users which was easy to use with a fancy look. Also, Marketing suggested the remote control to be the shape of cool fruits with fewer buttons because they should target the young user group that would be keen on new device innovation. Next, User Interface presented on the sample of sensor speaker but didn't recommend it because it didn't add too much functional design and it was not mature to use it as a speech recognition engine. The group agreed with User Interface to have two scroll wheels with turbo button and switch on button. Then, Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the component design. The group decided to use a power source with spongy design and double curve chip for easy handling. Lastly, Project Manager helped conclude the features on the upcoming prototype presentation and asked group mates to prepare individually on it.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Is that alright now ? {vocalsound} Okay . Sorry ? Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design .\nMarketing:Could you plug me in ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager:All ready to go ? Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the {disfmarker} The first one {vocalsound} is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the {disfmarker} of the remote control .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .\nMarketing:And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?\nProject Manager:Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um {vocalsound} uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say {disfmarker} Uh something {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I mean do they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . So that's something we can discuss as well . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . Um so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ?\nIndustrial Designer:Nope , we're all set .\nProject Manager:Right um , time for presentations then . Who would like to go first ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'll go first .\nProject Manager:Okay , cool .\nMarketing:Sure .\nUser Interface:Alright um , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh yeah , of course , yeah . G go on ahead .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} so this is the technical functions design . Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Right {gap} to do the um {vocalsound} the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um {vocalsound} your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . {vocalsound} Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , um {gap} sh show you now . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright {gap} .\nUser Interface:{gap} here um the button there and there . This one's prog . Sorry . That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . Um it's a very simple one . It's got only the basic functions mm but um {vocalsound} it's the same size as the the hard to use one .\nProject Manager:Oop .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh it looked a bit clunky . They're very big and not very much use for {gap} buttons . {vocalsound} Um , {vocalsound} and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . Um it's very easy to use . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . {vocalsound} Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha {gap} from the bottom of it . So , {vocalsound} now I'd like to ask for your preferences . Um not sure of how long we've got , uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um . Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Just a couple of minutes anyway .\nMarketing:M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But anyway ,\nProject Manager:Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now .\nMarketing:um we might come to that later .\nIndustrial Designer:Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um , the clunky one is the one on the right .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um clunky in what sense , like um h heavier ? Larger ?\nUser Interface:Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . It's , you know , it's very spread out\nMarketing:I see , so it's more just basic .\nProject Manager:Looks kind of {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:and kind of {disfmarker} you know\nMarketing:Right , okay .\nUser Interface:, I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . {vocalsound} {gap} got very few buttons on it and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Sure .\nProject Manager:Well I think it's a valid point . I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think that's a good idea .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I think it's a good idea . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um , {vocalsound} do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? Would you like\nMarketing:Which was that ?\nUser Interface:um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Up {disfmarker} the numbers , or the up down ?\nProject Manager:God , I wou I would say that's required ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean would anybody disagree with that ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , what else , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So don't need to worry about teletext ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about ,\nMarketing:We don't ? No ?\nProject Manager:you know like brightness and contrast ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ?\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Is that right ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Is that what we're we're doing ?\nUser Interface:Um , yeah .\nMarketing:We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ?\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think {disfmarker} are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ?\nUser Interface:Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:um and after that we can add things if they're possible .\nProject Manager:Okay , right . Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yep .\nUser Interface:There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .\nProject Manager:Right okay . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm yeah .\nMarketing:Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .\nProject Manager:Oka\nMarketing:For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and then others that are concealed .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Something like that .\nProject Manager:Uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section {disfmarker} Have I just lost {disfmarker} Oh no . Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . Any of {disfmarker} you anything to add to that at all ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll add it later , I guess {gap} the presentation .\nProject Manager:Okay , right .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um\nMarketing:Sure .\nProject Manager:Do you wanna {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Do you want to switch places ?\nMarketing:Can this can this pl reach ? Can this plug come across ?\nIndustrial Designer:No . No .\nProject Manager:Probably not , actually .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:So why don't I just pick up and move then .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Here , I'll just {vocalsound} Why don't I just {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Just just switch them .\nMarketing:Mm er , can you go up behind me ? Kinda {disfmarker} This is so {disfmarker} This {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} bit complicated . It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ?\nMarketing:I'm all in a knot now .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh {vocalsound} the things .\nProject Manager:Oh , like overlap between what you said ?\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh well , for all you know that {disfmarker} that'll happen .\nMarketing:Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely .\nProject Manager:Mm hard to know what {disfmarker} where your role ends , yeah .\nMarketing:Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So how do I how do I get this up ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um function F_ eight .\nProject Manager:Uh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay . Alright . So {disfmarker} F_ eight ?\nIndustrial Designer:Function , the blue button . Next to the control on the left . Yeah .\nMarketing:Oh , and F_ eight . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:You have to push it together .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Okay , I think that that's doing it now .\nIndustrial Designer:Nope . Try that again .\nMarketing:Uh , again ?\nIndustrial Designer:Wait .\nUser Interface:Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah , you wanna {disfmarker} Oh oh here we go .\nMarketing:Um ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yep , there we go .\nProject Manager:There you go .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} okay great . Okay . Just um {disfmarker} Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's {disfmarker} now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Increase that 'cause we can't see the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:That's much better .\nProject Manager:Right . Can you um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:There you go .\nProject Manager:Right , okay .\nMarketing:Okay . Alright . That would be {disfmarker} Okay . So um does that make sense ? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could {disfmarker} and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . Uh to think about trends and also about {disfmarker} try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Bouncing on top . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Dunno . Okay . Um .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um {vocalsound} the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay I'm gonna {disfmarker} we'll look at that in a second . Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't {disfmarker} doesn't really appeal to them .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like {disfmarker} if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . Um , {vocalsound} frustrations . They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . Um , takes time to learn how to use them . This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for .\nProject Manager:Repetitive strain injury .\nIndustrial Designer:Is installing a new remote control something that people {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh , no , that did not come up at all . Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um . {vocalsound} And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be {disfmarker} wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um people {vocalsound} uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .\nProject Manager:So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through .\nProject Manager:Mm . So it {disfmarker} you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's {disfmarker} I think it's a good idea .\nMarketing:Yeah . That's s that's sort of the um {disfmarker} But I {disfmarker} I'm {disfmarker} my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing:Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But not let that confine us technologically .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right .\nMarketing:So Alright ? Any um comments on all of that ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um {disfmarker} who's our our target audience , our target market .\nMarketing:That's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:I mean {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Where's the money , maybe .\nProject Manager:Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine ,\nMarketing:Yeah . And who watches T_V_ . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:well I don't {disfmarker} I'm not really sure how much that will retail at .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:But you want {disfmarker} it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So , who do you think we're aiming this at ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Is that too {disfmarker} is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ?\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . Kind of .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:You know how much ? I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ?\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Like a simple replacement , right . I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:would you {disfmarker} how much would you pay ?\nMarketing:This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . These are the age groups which we have information on\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and these are {disfmarker} this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay\nMarketing:Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Mostly focused around the twenty five age group .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? What what do you think , Craig ?\nUser Interface:Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? Sort of the the older group .\nMarketing:Uh , yeah , it's the {disfmarker} Yep .\nUser Interface:Uh f\nMarketing:It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying ,\nProject Manager:N yeah .\nMarketing:in terms of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it .\nMarketing:Yeah . Sure . Sure .\nProject Manager:So um anybody {disfmarker} anything there to add {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Just kind of young professionals , uh th like {vocalsound} if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . So we could say that was our target .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:who are familiar with their {disfmarker} with computers in in their everyday work .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think people who are maybe about {disfmarker} I wouldn't say thirty five ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , sure .\nIndustrial Designer:So these are people who are gadgety , right ?\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular\nProject Manager:Yeah . So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . Mm .\nProject Manager:That that's that's a good point .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um okay , so um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition\nMarketing:If we can .\nIndustrial Designer:I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now ,\nProject Manager:if we can .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple .\nProject Manager:Okay . Why is that ?\nIndustrial Designer:You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Could it be an on off thing ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um ,\nMarketing:Like if you want it on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology ,\nProject Manager:Where you can activate it and deactivate it ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah . Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe we should {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sure .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I suggest that we think about speech recognition ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Sure . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:anyway it's a {disfmarker} it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Sure . Yep .\nProject Manager:Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentation\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , sure .\nProject Manager:and then then we can {disfmarker} I don't know {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , it's good {disfmarker} well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind .\nProject Manager:Yeah , exactly , yeah .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well .\nMarketing:Not {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:Yeah . And not losing . And also it helps in terms of people not losing this ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:you know they {disfmarker} they're saying oh it's {disfmarker} I lose it in the couch .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:that they {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Really ?\nUser Interface:Channel up .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh really , you've seen one before .\nProject Manager:Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad .\nProject Manager:Mm . Course not .\nIndustrial Designer:Thanks . Cool ,\nProject Manager:There you go .\nIndustrial Designer:um . Okay . Um .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Well this is just the working design um .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well this is just what {disfmarker} how I would go about it . Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're {disfmarker} we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like {disfmarker} Besides the basics , I think back {disfmarker} in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and I just {disfmarker} the idea is just to get everybody to um {disfmarker} I usually {vocalsound} have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that {disfmarker} to start everything going . But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think um there's a need for that . Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . It just explains how the process goes through , from a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . Um okay , you need some power source . 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Like for example , voice recognition , right . That might be constrained because that {disfmarker} you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . Um {vocalsound} Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic {disfmarker} a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . It's fairly general , um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:like um voice recognition , right , um , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . So it's not really a constraint in that sense ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:what the technology has to do .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um so I guess the rest of it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? I think that's more relevant to a discussion ?\nProject Manager:Uh .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ?\nMarketing:Sure . Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , w I'm done .\nProject Manager:Are you are you all done ?\nIndustrial Designer:More or less . Yeah . Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:you know , stuff like that .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:And like on the {disfmarker} means {disfmarker} b\nIndustrial Designer:I guess this would be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like {disfmarker} what are our options ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Alright , what's what i in {disfmarker} Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin\nIndustrial Designer:Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . This is just um\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:a basic principles and basic components that are needed .\nMarketing:The basic principle of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:For example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:broken down into more components , right ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that .\nProject Manager:Oh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh Yep . Yep . So each component represents one function ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and the power are things that you won't have to care about .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ?\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha\nIndustrial Designer:There might be one other problem with the transmission , um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm\nIndustrial Designer:I it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you may not require that ,\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:but you know , um it's it's\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and push a button maybe to start s talking about it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .\nProject Manager:Mm . Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So in that sense , there's not really a restriction\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Not so much further down .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And um just a clarification before we finish this . Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ?\nIndustrial Designer:There's there's not much specific specific information ,\nProject Manager:W\nIndustrial Designer:but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . Because infra-red is something which everybody has .\nProject Manager:Yeah . W Well well we've um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Just to T_V_ , okay .\nProject Manager:so that's what we should do for now I think . Something I was wondering about was the power .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think ,\nIndustrial Designer:There's a there's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it ,\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Or you need to get the user to plug it in .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:then I don't think rechargeable is something we should {disfmarker} you know , we really need to care about .\nProject Manager:Okay , so just stick to to regular {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um , right . So basically the um {disfmarker} I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and what exactly the product's gonna do .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So um just to recap on {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager:Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ?\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel .\nProject Manager:Okay , right .\nUser Interface:Ta .\nMarketing:And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ?\nUser Interface:Um I think we include mute , but apart from that um I think we just {disfmarker} we'll go for the simpleness .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , I think\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under {disfmarker} like sort of under a door or some {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's as optional functions .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:'Cause what what I'm {disfmarker} I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I dunno if that'd be a problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:One would be audio controls ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean it might help with the visualisation .\nMarketing:'Kay , okay . Like that . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And it would actually help with the component build as well .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , right .\nMarketing:Mm okay , great .\nProject Manager:Um , okay well I gotta kind of {disfmarker} got five minutes to wrap up now . Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . Whoohoo . Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next {disfmarker} well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . So um I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , do you wanna start with David . Anything else to say at all ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm no , not really .\nProject Manager:No , okay . {vocalsound} Andrew ?\nMarketing:Um yeah , just {disfmarker} I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:Shall we do that , then ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , great .\nUser Interface:Um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um things like on off . Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you know , um so um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And and channel .\nIndustrial Designer:And channel . Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Not on off video . Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . We put it out .\nProject Manager:Okay , so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume {disfmarker} hi\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , anything to do with what you hear , right . You you put that into audio .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And then video is anything that you can see .\nProject Manager:Okay , and then visual {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um . Yep .\nProject Manager:and then just actual device things ,\nMarketing:Colour , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:like what channel you're watching , turning on an off ,\nMarketing:Sure . Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:stuff like that .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah . Sure , okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:It's easy to use , I think that's one thing that um {disfmarker} and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause things are like fixed . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:you know , things like that . Um , {vocalsound} so I guess I guess that's it . That's the meeting over .\nMarketing:Great .\nProject Manager:Whoohoo .\nMarketing:Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "This meeting was about the functional design of the remote control. Firstly, User Interface presented on the technical function design. For the previous remote, User Interface found it was clunky but the functions were basic, or the remote was too complicated with lots of buttons. Based on this, User Interface demonstrated two kinds of buttons access to advanced functions. Next, Marketing presented on market trends and proposed three inspirations including the fancy look and technology innovation based on the customer needs. Then, Industrial Designer presented on the working design and introduced the working design logic of the battery and power source. Lastly, the group discussed the remote functions. They decided to have fifteen to thirty-five-year-old target groups as well as to have video controls map to advanced functionality so that they could skip the basic channel button.",

I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but {vocalsound} then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Next .\nProject Manager:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:So y you are the secretary also .\nProject Manager:Yes . Indeed .\nIndustrial Designer:Right ? Okay .\nProject Manager:Then I hope you all have uh worked out {vocalsound} some some uh {vocalsound} some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Um . W We will uh in a minute we will uh {vocalsound} start with them . Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . Uh Um about the functions\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker} Well in this meeting we should really {vocalsound} try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:You mean the social target group who we wants to target ?\nProject Manager:Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh the customers , okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:the customers , indeed yes . Think that's that's important matter .\nMarketing:That's the big question yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} And then uh we will close this meeting uh\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . Good . Um . Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ?\nMarketing:No , I don't .\nProject Manager:You don't have presentation ?\nMarketing:I wasn't . No .\nProject Manager:Uh you want a table to to uh\nMarketing:I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything .\nProject Manager:Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . Um . It's {disfmarker} probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it . Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Um .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Um .\nProject Manager:Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ?\nMarketing:I have an a web page yes .\nProject Manager:Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . Uh about this .\nMarketing:Yep . Yep , sure . Mm-hmm . So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um {vocalsound} and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Um . Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . Um .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . Um .\nProject Manager:Yes yes , I have {vocalsound} that too {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay too much time to learn . Okay .\nMarketing:Um . And thirty {disfmarker} twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Not enough {gap}\nMarketing:I don't know how we'd go about combating that .\nUser Interface:{gap} . What do you mean there ?\nMarketing:For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:So . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm . They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ?\nMarketing:Yeah . That's what the report says yeah .\nProject Manager:So mm .\nMarketing:Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now .\nUser Interface:You can disconnect it there\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You can maybe just just {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:no ?\nMarketing:Oh no , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah it's {vocalsound} it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:okay .\nMarketing:Um , s hang on .\nIndustrial Designer:O otherwise you yeah . You can connect this one .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Then you can connect this one or this one yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:All to your computer .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well .\nIndustrial Designer:So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:Oh I need to muck around with this . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . It's just a web link .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {gap}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design .\nUser Interface:Hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the {disfmarker} hang on a minute .\nIndustrial Designer:Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yep .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Speech recognition in {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .\nProject Manager:D do you have numbers o o on that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Ah okay .\nMarketing:Yes , I'll just get this up .\nIndustrial Designer:So that we don't {disfmarker} Do we not need any button on the remote control {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well potentially yeah , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it would be all based on speech .\nMarketing:I think even for interesti\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Interesting idea .\nMarketing:yeah I think that would not work so well . You wanna have both options .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my {disfmarker} well it's {disfmarker} we should be in range ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . But the these are all quite fancy features\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for {vocalsound} for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Well it would be f\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:No you can't .\nIndustrial Designer:And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ?\nUser Interface:Oh . Well , {vocalsound} it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes ,\nUser Interface:It's it's going to be li\nProject Manager:that that that that's mm .\nUser Interface:it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case\nProject Manager:Do you have some more important facts\nUser Interface:but it's {disfmarker} but I don't know with twenty fi\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or can we go to the next presentation ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:you had to to to summarise maybe the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Okay it's uh decline .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:But we sh\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Decline with age , mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:which we'll be talking about later I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yes . We will talk about it later . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Did you get the email ?\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yep , that one .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Just follow that link .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} I thi {vocalsound} You us\nMarketing:It'll be in a different window , yep .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah yeah .\nMarketing:That's {disfmarker} left {disfmarker} that one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay perfect . .. .\nMarketing:Mm . So that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .\nProject Manager:Mm . Okay . {vocalsound} um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Mm I okay\nProject Manager:Oh ,\nIndustrial Designer:I stay {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:this is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Now you can move I think yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I can move as far as {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe I take your chair ?\nProject Manager:Yes . You can you can sa take my chair .\nIndustrial Designer:I okay {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:It's a channel selection , a module {gap} , this and this function ,\nMarketing:Sorry ? Oh .\nUser Interface:go to the {gap} . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer . And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um {vocalsound} is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important .\nMarketing:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first {vocalsound} the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want {vocalsound} . Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh {disfmarker} it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh {gap} the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:right . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's {disfmarker} my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:right .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . This is {vocalsound} very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And um so what I have found and {vocalsound} after a lot of work actually I {vocalsound} I draw this I draw for you this uh schema\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me\nMarketing:You drew it a long time ago ?\nIndustrial Designer:you know .\nProject Manager:Is huh\nMarketing:Ninety one . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that\nProject Manager:overwhelming {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And and why do you want these kind of component ?\nIndustrial Designer:So . So\nProject Manager:I mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? What were your {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components\nProject Manager:Yes . It it it's more clear now I think .\nIndustrial Designer:but maybe yeah {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma\nIndustrial Designer:No no no no we we will uh {disfmarker} This is a preference but we can always change uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . So we we must adapt to the to the receiver .\nIndustrial Designer:Of course yeah .\nProject Manager:I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . We will use uh {vocalsound} infrared protocol uh using {vocalsound} yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting {vocalsound} the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles .\nProject Manager:Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . Yes . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um . Okay . {gap}\nProject Manager:Thank you .\nUser Interface:Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies .\nIndustrial Designer:The frequencies ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah . Of course yeah\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But you should be careful ,\nIndustrial Designer:in the chip you have it yeah .\nUser Interface:people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s {vocalsound} , so basically {gap} through all the things .\nIndustrial Designer:That can control o other things . Yeah .\nMarketing:Ah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So maybe we should think of {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Of course yeah we should take that into account\nMarketing:That's handy .\nProject Manager:Yeah yes\nMarketing:So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off .\nProject Manager:I I I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:in the uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ {vocalsound} and you can just walk away {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah . I like that idea .\nProject Manager:I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew .\nUser Interface:Yeah\nProject Manager:I I I assume you were finished here .\nUser Interface:so {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Uh okay .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound} So I can take I think mine now there .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay so voila .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Oh . I {disfmarker} Uh , sorry ? I know where it is .\nUser Interface:It's on the desktop .\nProject Manager:It's uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Technical function .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Like so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well . So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yep .\nUser Interface:so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh {vocalsound} um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver . So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but {vocalsound} tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . Then there is uh {vocalsound} this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch {vocalsound} . And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market . And then {disfmarker} whi which is generally used by the people . And then {vocalsound} well personal preferences I would {disfmarker} uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the {disfmarker} we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote {disfmarker} video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so you {disfmarker} on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:or does it know which one you want to use ?\nUser Interface:Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and you could play it or {disfmarker} You can also think about having like um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nUser Interface:and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm mm mm mm mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:These are kind of next generation {vocalsound} functionalities .\nUser Interface:It's the next generation thing ,\nProject Manager:Mm yes ,\nUser Interface:but it is going to come in couple of years .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:but I think it's i i it's already there ,\nUser Interface:It's goi\nProject Manager:I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop .\nUser Interface:Yeah it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah . That's fair enough . Mm . But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . That's ,\nUser Interface:No no we are not making a universal remote ,\nMarketing:yeah .\nUser Interface:we are just looking at uh giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me .\nMarketing:Mm . Because y\nProject Manager:W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nProject Manager:Mean , you can go {vocalsound} pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects\nMarketing:Mm . Yep .\nProject Manager:yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But it's good to keep in mind .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Okay so that p ends my presentation .\nProject Manager:Mm . Very well .\nUser Interface:Well . So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently {vocalsound} booming up actually\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And it\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:basically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Good .\nUser Interface:And thi this is going to come .\nIndustrial Designer:Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah\nProject Manager:Um , so u um\nUser Interface:so . Yeah .\nProject Manager:I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you . Um\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but it's it's getting used less and less .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's that's especially because of the internet of course .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:So we should think about it um . Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . Um\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh , or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ?\nProject Manager:Uh indeed indeed .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:And and and the hard disk recorders . Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh {vocalsound} y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and our our current customers are mainly forty plus\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:uh which well\nIndustrial Designer:Fourteen\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} Forty .\nIndustrial Designer:or for O okay .\nProject Manager:So\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older {disfmarker} older\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and you'll al {vocalsound} always need to have the the future with younger people .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um therefore , {vocalsound} younger people like trendy {disfmarker} trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market ,\nUser Interface:Yeah so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Hmm . Yes yes\nMarketing:that's the the the mm the new and the funky things ,\nProject Manager:mo\nIndustrial Designer:Because they are already used to that , you know , product .\nMarketing:that's ,\nProject Manager:Yes it's recognisable {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls .\nProject Manager:Mm mm .\nMarketing:That's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And and they are skilled uh by using it .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:So for example uh {disfmarker} Well uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . .. .\nUser Interface:Okay , it works . Fine . So , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that\nProject Manager:Mael can you hand me over this uh ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {gap}\nProject Manager:Uh thank you .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Okay . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ?\nProject Manager:Mm well\nMarketing:'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all\nProject Manager:I think fi five min\nUser Interface:Forty minutes ?\nMarketing:and it's a very important issue .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so . {vocalsound} too sorry , so we basically don't change the uh original order of them\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but then the keys are more spacious ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:they don't look uh {disfmarker} so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six ,\nMarketing:Mm . Mm .\nUser Interface:so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:for you don't have too many keys\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to\nProject Manager:Okay . 'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Which I think is quite tricky .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Of course they have already one . So our our our remote control has to be better .\nMarketing:But it's not going to have more functionality ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might {disfmarker} we'll be able to {vocalsound} beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing .\nProject Manager:Mm . I {disfmarker} well I think {vocalsound} many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah . But why are they buying one in the first place ?\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker} Indeed . So that will be about functionality {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things .\nProject Manager:Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing:In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality .\nProject Manager:So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product .\nProject Manager:What do {disfmarker} What do you think about {disfmarker} What componen\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh we can include it in our control some new new features .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . And um {disfmarker} But yeah\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} yeah . If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that\nIndustrial Designer:that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:which would drive the cost up a lot .\nProject Manager:I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary .\nIndustrial Designer:Ye\nProject Manager:Is the L_C_D_ screen {disfmarker}\nMarketing:For universal remotes {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary {disfmarker} well , th for long term .\nMarketing:If you {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager:I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive .\nMarketing:And quite complicated to use ,\nProject Manager:S so we can try to go in between ,\nMarketing:yes .\nProject Manager:and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Not as flexible maybe , yeah , but s\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Universal .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on .\nProject Manager:Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group .\nMarketing:Okay . So they're {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:People {disfmarker} yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yep . I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know .\nProject Manager:Uh well\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So d Do you agree ?\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker} Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah\nUser Interface:Uh and it d uh {disfmarker} Our provin\nIndustrial Designer:because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is {vocalsound} uh price of a chip is very cheap .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less {vocalsound} yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control .\nUser Interface:Uh yeah , that's that's what we needed basically .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm . Mm . Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh that's needed right now . And uh basically you can look to the standards of other {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's needed , yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And if we want to get the market , we really need that .\nMarketing:Yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Actu\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Exactly . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .\nIndustrial Designer:Is that okay for you ? Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm mm mm mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m {vocalsound} maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm yep .\nUser Interface:Voila {vocalsound} . Hmm .\nProject Manager:So anyone uh has a point to bring in\nUser Interface:So . Well .\nProject Manager:or shall we {disfmarker} no .\nUser Interface:Oh I don't have anything right now . We can we'll we'll go\nIndustrial Designer:Oh\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:that's that's fine then .\nUser Interface:and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:W yes ,\nUser Interface:for the {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we uh we can have lunch now .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So um Then th th the next meeting will uh\nUser Interface:Yeah so we meet in {disfmarker} well {vocalsound} what are our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . But you will be informed via the computer .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Cool . So see you later .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay {vocalsound} perfect .\n",
        "summary": "The whole meeting was focused on the target group and the functionality of the new remote control product. After Project Manager briefly reaffirmed the meeting procedure, Marketing, Industrial Designer, and User Interface each gave a presentation about trend-watching, working design, technical function respectively. Then, Project Manager started a group discussion about the demand for teletext and video, for which thick key design was accepted as a feasible solution. Then, the group discussed the target group based on the predetermined budget, and accepted universality as an important feature.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay . Hello everyone . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hi .\nUser Interface:Hi .\nMarketing:Hi .\nProject Manager:Um how uh how we doing ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , good .\nProject Manager:Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the {disfmarker} within the budget uh that was given . Uh in general {vocalsound} the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . So we should address that . And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . Um also mentioned was it should be uh {disfmarker} it should have a very short learning curve . And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed , mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um {disfmarker} you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . Francino who is our um\nUser Interface:Interface designer .\nProject Manager:interface designer um uh has mentioned that the {disfmarker} that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . It should be compact . Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And {vocalsound} even possibly a timer to {disfmarker} so that people can program {vocalsound} their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? Okay .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , then we {disfmarker} I'm looking for three presentations . And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh , I don't I don't think so , so whoever w wants {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay , I can start first .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Okay . Now my slide , please . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , your slides . Okay . Oh , come on , close already .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And that's number two , right ?\nUser Interface:Three .\nProject Manager:Three .\nUser Interface:Participant three . Yes . Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . Next , please . Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .\nProject Manager:Nine what ? Nine channel uh switches ?\nUser Interface:Pardon me ?\nProject Manager:Nine channel switches ? Is {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes , nine numbers . And then you have swapping of uh button\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:by which {disfmarker} using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Going to the nex next .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Next slide , please .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the {gap} the subtitles on the screen .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . Now there should be a memory switch . There should be a mute button . Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch {disfmarker} he can uh {disfmarker} while talking he can watch the T_V_ . Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see {disfmarker} we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the {disfmarker} uh yeah , the remote will {disfmarker} automatically it will switch to the ninth channel .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . So this is one one of the interface which can be created .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Then , please , next slide .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . Even a kid can use that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So can you go on t t uh to the next slide . Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for T_V_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for V_C_R_ , D_V_D_s and audio . And this has in-built voice recogniser .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Can you go on to the next slide ? Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it . And this comes with different colours , different shapes .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and all the important uh buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . Next slide , please . Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:You don't know me .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} this . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I could lose that in a minute . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So this is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No this is a very big , you cannot {vocalsound} misplace it anywhere .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:This i this is one such interface which can be created . {vocalsound} And the personal preference {vocalsound} uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Right .\nUser Interface:Thank you , that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay , thank you very much . Uh any comments on uh her presentation ?\nMarketing:Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um what uh {vocalsound} I'm {disfmarker} No suggestion's bad .\nUser Interface:Mm yes .\nMarketing:But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . I don't think that we can get uh {disfmarker} The T-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I I th I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , I think the these are her presentations , but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after\nMarketing:Yeah mm . Mm-hmm . Have to come back to that later . Okay .\nUser Interface:We can .\nProject Manager:but if {disfmarker} I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation .\nMarketing:No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm right . Mm-hmm . Ho who wants to go next um ? Mm-hmm . Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe .\nProject Manager:and you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Participant two .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh the next one , sorry .\nProject Manager:Oops .\nIndustrial Designer:It's it was the old one .\nProject Manager:The components design .\nIndustrial Designer:Components .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , can you go on to the next slide , please .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I have just brief {vocalsound} uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it's like {disfmarker} Uh it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just uh uh , {vocalsound} you know , if you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if it falls down , then it doesn't {vocalsound} break . So it should be strong .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that . And it should be recyclable .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh and uh {vocalsound} ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Good point .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it {disfmarker} you should {disfmarker} we should have a highly sophisticated one . And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh {vocalsound} be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . And uh it should be with uh {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} equipped with timer and alarm facility . And the uh other component we should {disfmarker} uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through {vocalsound} through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery , capacitor . Can you go on to the next slide , please ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are {disfmarker} which we have to use in a remote controller . A battery uh , I would like to suggest one thing uh if we {disfmarker} uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:It it it's not a high voltage battery . Then also we can {disfmarker} If it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . Can you go to the next slide , please . And how it works , how the remote controller works .\nProject Manager:Go away .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you . Uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b {vocalsound} that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . Like {vocalsound} you have got a signal by pressing a button . That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . That is the use of transist transistor we {disfmarker} which we use in the remote controller . It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . Then it will do the appropriate action . So uh this is how the remote controller works .\nUser Interface:It works .\nIndustrial Designer:Can you go to the next slide , please . Yeah , I have few pictures . When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} this is a normal remote controller . And {gap} to the next slide , please .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And where we had a a few buttons and all . And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm {disfmarker} yeah , and di and a diode transistor .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:The electronic components {disfmarker} uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d {vocalsound} diode transistors an Yeah , di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm yes .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh you can also see the uh uh the green {disfmarker} two green things are uh these are {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are resistors ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh just beside that you can see a transistor , and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . Uh and also there are uh {vocalsound} um resistors {disfmarker} uh sorry , ther there is a diode .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Can you go {disfmarker} go on to the next slide .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh this is the circuit board . The green one is a circuit board . Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , because uh {vocalsound} uh when you {disfmarker} when you are building uh some circuits {disfmarker} some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not exactly wires we are using . It's just printing something on a board .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . So th that green uh thing is a circuit board , and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal {disfmarker} signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit .\nUser Interface:Transmit .\nIndustrial Designer:Can you go to the next slide , please . Uh so this is {disfmarker} these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . Uh can you see the black uh , round marks ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:They they are the circuits .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Next , please . And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like {vocalsound} instead off buttons we have some scrolls . Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh {vocalsound} uh uh full {disfmarker} a complete chip .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery , uh or we can use solar sells . Uh .\nMarketing:Hmm , that's interesting .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases . Uh usually , the cases and card flat {vocalsound} that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And you have more pictures . Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe d uh I have just one more slide , I think . Um . Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use . Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re {vocalsound} or an advanced chip on the print , um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . Um yeah the uh {disfmarker} for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker . An Yeah , that's it . It's all for me now ,\nProject Manager:Okay , well thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:thank you .\nProject Manager:Any particular comments by anybody ?\nMarketing:Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?\nIndustrial Designer:No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh {vocalsound} which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons .\nMarketing:Um . We'll just go for push buttons\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah uh yeah , push-buttons . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Push-buttons .\nMarketing:for {disfmarker} in the interest of cost .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her her thing .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . Go right to my first {disfmarker} my next slide .\nProject Manager:Uh okay .\nMarketing:Um alright , my method is uh {disfmarker} I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . I s I {vocalsound} spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . And I would encourage you all to do the same . Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . Um people like something that really fits in their hand .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nMarketing:Simple is beautiful . They don't want to have to squint at small print um , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they don't {vocalsound} care for the mode thing . They want each button to do something . And eye-catching is important . It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you . Um {vocalsound} and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . Ours has to be {disfmarker} look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . So we've gotta narrow our selection down to {vocalsound} li {vocalsound} two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . And I've been looking around um at what designs {disfmarker} every year different things are popular . And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone . And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And uh so what do we think on the concept\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:of the remote ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?\nProject Manager:Y {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh yes , I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ?\nUser Interface:This could be uh one feature which could be sellable .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but w\nMarketing:Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature .\nProject Manager:I think that's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:That that {gap} be really good , yeah , I agree with that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how {vocalsound} how uh far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues .\nMarketing:Distance problem ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it's uh {disfmarker} everything so i\nMarketing:Uh .\nProject Manager:Well , you you teach {disfmarker} You have to teach uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No , it's it's , uh yeah , it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I will already record uh a question like , uh good morning ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on . It will recognise my voice and will switch on .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , before we get too far off here um , the components of the concept is the energy . What kind of energy do we foresee ? Battery .\nMarketing:I think I think battery ,\nProject Manager:Battery .\nUser Interface:Battery .\nMarketing:and I think we all agreed on that .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay then {vocalsound} chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:And the case . And I think we all agree on the case , we wanna have something uh maybe bright , colourful .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong .\nUser Interface:And compact .\nIndustrial Designer:And also strong .\nUser Interface:Trendy design and compact .\nIndustrial Designer:Trendy , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Trendy design , compact and strong .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:User interface concept , uh {vocalsound} interface type , supplements\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That will be your area I think , right , Jana .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . Um like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .\nUser Interface:Push-buttons .\nProject Manager:Put uh k I guess uh for {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Push-buttons .\nProject Manager:yeah . And {vocalsound} Not sure what they mean by supplements .\nUser Interface:And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well , I think that {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Oh , like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:or {vocalsound} or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement .\nProject Manager:Oh . A what ?\nMarketing:Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .\nProject Manager:Right , right , right , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Recogniser . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the uh I_D_ is to {disfmarker} this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to {vocalsound} uh come up with the user interface design ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and the marketing expert with the product evaluation .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You will receive specific {vocalsound} instructions {vocalsound} will be sent to you by your coaches .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um if you have any questions , you know , you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach , I suppose . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Wherever they're hiding ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} so um I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Thank you very much .\nUser Interface:Thank you .\n",
        "summary": "After Project Manager recapped the decisions made in the last meeting, such as having a child lock and display clock, User Interface started the presentation regarding how to make the interface more attractive to customers. Then, Industrial Designer gave the presentation on the component design of the remote, which was divided into two parts - the components in the remote and the working design. Afterwards, Marketing reported findings for marketing like the people wanting fewer buttons which the functions were obvious. In the end, Project Manager wrapped up the meeting, concluding what had to be done by each of them for the next meeting.",

How was that , was that fun ?\nUser Interface:Mm . Very fun .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Upsidaisy . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um we {disfmarker}\nMarketing:E excuse me I forgot my\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:copy . {gap}\nProject Manager:Alright , okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:He's gonna get his pen .\nUser Interface:Oh right . Okay .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , there's good news ?\nProject Manager:Uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:we have budget problems .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . Cutbacks .\nProject Manager:I'm afraid you're all sacked . Oops .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't even have this on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , have you got a presentation to make ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:No , not mine yet .\nProject Manager:No . Okay\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:so it's just your your show .\nIndustrial Designer:Um maybe we should bring {gap} so that the camera can see {gap} . Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay . Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:We made three for you .\nProject Manager:Three ? Oh .\nUser Interface:Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato\nProject Manager:Tomato ? What tomato ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and the other one is st\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't recall a tomato . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over .\nProject Manager:Ah I see , okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um\nProject Manager:Logo .\nUser Interface:the slogan , yeah ,\nProject Manager:Okay , brilliant .\nUser Interface:that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:um but mainly it's speech recognition .\nProject Manager:Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah and {vocalsound} yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there .\nProject Manager:Alright , okay .\nUser Interface:Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want .\nProject Manager:That's groovy . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh can I have {gap}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .\nUser Interface:Yeah , sure . Um that one is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh sorry s {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh no , it's delicate .\nProject Manager:At Oh dear .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand .\nProject Manager:Alright , okay .\nUser Interface:It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand .\nProject Manager:Okay , brilliant mm .\nUser Interface:Um the black on the back is the slogan .\nProject Manager:Okay , nice and obvious there {vocalsound} ,\nUser Interface:Uh yeah , that {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well , we did think of that .\nProject Manager:if it's standing up , I guess , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle .\nProject Manager:Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre .\nUser Interface:So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed .\nProject Manager:Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can {disfmarker} you all can hold it , is {disfmarker} it does actually feel quite ergonomic ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:if you've got small hands .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:It would have to be a bit bigger .\nProject Manager:Yeah , scale model , yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um and {vocalsound} um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright , excellent .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We used those {gap} . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:It's not in the traditional place ,\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:but um it's quite an obvious place .\nProject Manager:It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . Excellent .\nUser Interface:So {vocalsound} there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yep . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:A a more friendly type of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , {vocalsound} so so Barney the banana {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , right . It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ah excellent , just what we need .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Say it for the camera .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , right .\nProject Manager:Cool {gap} yeah . Well , nice to have uh options at least .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So are there any um improvements or issues or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It won't stand .\nProject Manager:Oh there are issues , oh there are issues .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Just let it lie down , it wont stand . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nProject Manager:Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nProject Manager:So we have to\nIndustrial Designer:What's on the uh on the left ? {gap}\nProject Manager:rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} There we go .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Oh god , why is it doing that ?\nUser Interface:Ooh .\nProject Manager:There we go . {vocalsound} So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um .\nUser Interface:More like a traditional remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And by doing so {disfmarker} Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much . I don't know what's going on with this again .\nIndustrial Designer:W why is the uh double curved two of them ?\nProject Manager:Oh , good point .\nMarketing:And double curve on both sides ?\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:Curve {vocalsound} . Yeah , this is double-curve ,\nProject Manager:That's {vocalsound} sort of curve in and out .\nMarketing:no ?\nIndustrial Designer:Is i\nMarketing:This is double-curve . It {disfmarker} This one is single curve .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . So double-curve .\nProject Manager:No , I think it means double curved as in um\nUser Interface:Like an S_ shape .\nProject Manager:like uh {gap} a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , I might be wrong though .\nMarketing:Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side .\nProject Manager:I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape .\nMarketing:Hmm . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:A curvature is like the {disfmarker} this case .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} got two of them {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well we can work around that um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Right . No .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Cut things out . But you think it should be one .\nProject Manager:It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:but um {disfmarker} Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again . No maybe the shift button's stuck in .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Should {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh that's fine .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , so we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty .\nUser Interface:Cool . Cool .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So we could even add something .\nProject Manager:We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately .\nIndustrial Designer:We should fire the accountants .\nProject Manager:What ?\nIndustrial Designer:Fire the accountants . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Ah yeah , we could add things .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Does that work ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well .\nIndustrial Designer:No mm {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Uh you can do one thing {gap} .\nProject Manager:I don't know .\nMarketing:You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this {disfmarker} Okay .\nProject Manager:It {disfmarker} One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Just uh just uh {disfmarker} Okay , just a minute . Okay . No input , like this . {vocalsound} Shift . No it's not .\nProject Manager:No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something .\nMarketing:Yeah , it's not working .\nIndustrial Designer:Is it the other shift button maybe ?\nMarketing:Should we ask Meli\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No that's fine . Um we've worked out what it would be anyway .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Did you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Cancel . Piss off .\nIndustrial Designer:That's too bad .\nProject Manager:Oh well , never mind . Um {vocalsound} . Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we {disfmarker} what could we reckon we could add ? Um\nUser Interface:Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe {disfmarker} I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front ,\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:because it's not in an ideal place right now .\nProject Manager:Well that's that's uh {disfmarker} Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve {vocalsound} Euros fifty . Project process , how do we think that went ? Are we happy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think we have a a winning product .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Evaluation . Oh we've been writing this up for m months .\nUser Interface:I think it went quite smoothly .\nProject Manager:Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ?\nUser Interface:W I think we were very creative .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , I mea I think it means sort of individually .\nUser Interface:Oh right , okay .\nProject Manager:Yes , no , maybe ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . Groovy . So uh we're just gonna . Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Great leadership . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Excellent leadership . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Thank you very much . You're all get you're all getting a raise . Uh teamwork . I thought went well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think .\nProject Manager:Uh and well means , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , we {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The technical stuff was brilliant .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Let's buy more .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh Right . Um\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} These pens are are neat though .\nProject Manager:I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these {gap} , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:. At le {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay . Groovy .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So just general thumbs up for all of us then .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:That kind of unfortunately is too quick .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Well um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} . I suppose yeah . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's it , um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , right .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay .\nProject Manager:Whoops . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Does it go back in , does it ? Reusable .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Something we should get {gap} .\nProject Manager:I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying .\nMarketing:So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Uh Brian , have you have you finished ?\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:Uh mine needs also this .\nProject Manager:Um I have , yes .\nMarketing:At last mine is also the presentation .\nProject Manager:Huh ? Oh right , okay , you've got more , okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Oh , you got a presentation ,\nProject Manager:Sorry uh .\nUser Interface:sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh ok\nProject Manager:It didn't bother to tell me that on this\nMarketing:S\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:thing . Is it ? Okay .\nMarketing:Uh {vocalsound} is the project evaluated , that is mine .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Doesn't tell me . {vocalsound} Oh you're doing that . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:Mm , love to eat that now .\nIndustrial Designer:Anybody {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Kind of a green banana now .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Clay covered banana .\nUser Interface:It's {disfmarker} this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got .\nProject Manager:O okay , hold on .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I've got .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} blue .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I wonder w which cell do I want . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:It's fun to touch .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So .\nUser Interface:Oh could you pass the tomato please .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Sorry . Thank you .\nMarketing:So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:means uh at what standard what standard {disfmarker} whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is {disfmarker} will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as {gap} fashion trends or not ? Means {vocalsound} because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite {gap} in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s\nUser Interface:Sorry {gap} . Sorry ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:carry on . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:So {vocalsound} but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So {disfmarker} Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:so we have to do it on a board .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:{gap} the user requirem I think .\nProject Manager:Alright , okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:The board working again , is it ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Do we have the uh the marker for the board ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh .\nUser Interface:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:There it is .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap}\nMarketing:So .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . First of all uh comes user requirement .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will {disfmarker} first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah , it did .\nMarketing:S\nUser Interface:It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um so .\nProject Manager:When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ ,\nUser Interface:Does it work ?\nProject Manager:so yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . So .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So what do you think you will personally give .\nProject Manager:of course we haven't actually got a working model yet .\nUser Interface:I would say seven .\nMarketing:Seven . Uh .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't {disfmarker} True or false ? No sorry tr one is true .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:One , yeah .\nMarketing:Uh one is {disfmarker} means highest ranking , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ?\nProject Manager:No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth\nIndustrial Designer:No that's false .\nMarketing:Okay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view .\nUser Interface:Okay , so one .\nMarketing:And what do you say our Industrial Expert ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh . It's hard to know . I I give it a two . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh d you can you can tell on on the like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um {gap} I'm gonna give it a two .\nMarketing:Two .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nMarketing:And what about uh you , Brian ?\nProject Manager:Oh , I'll go for a one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:You will go for one .\nProject Manager:Basic requirements but of the pro of the project .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah th {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:and\nUser Interface:Mm {vocalsound} yellow .\nMarketing:{disfmarker} Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:Come on that was the tha {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:So we are showing our preference for particular fruits ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Being fruitist . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:two or three kinds rather , and {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} So .\nUser Interface:Is that no is that not trends ?\nMarketing:Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:because whatever companies {disfmarker} they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So you can {gap} {disfmarker} what shape a person will like .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh . But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um {disfmarker} you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have {disfmarker} That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product .\nMarketing:Uh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally {disfmarker} won't give it {gap} beyond three .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No , I mean uh {vocalsound} obviously your opinion ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'm just trying to {disfmarker} Okay .\nMarketing:So we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} He's a tough cookie .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . Three or four ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh , no sorry ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:it should be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Six . Five or six .\nUser Interface:What are we doing ?\nIndustrial Designer:What are we doing ?\nMarketing:No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing .\nUser Interface:Adding them up ?\nIndustrial Designer:We're gonna average them ?\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So seven fourths .\nMarketing:and that's {disfmarker} I have taken it very wrongly .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:Yeah uh\nIndustrial Designer:About one point f one point eight .\nMarketing:three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{gap} because it is one point eight uh {gap} two , so we will do two .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh I see .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah round it up to two .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So trends .\nMarketing:So where were the trends .\nIndustrial Designer:Can you explain what you want us to write there ?\nMarketing:Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:How it {disfmarker} how conforms to the current trends ?\nMarketing:Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the {vocalsound} uh as a fruit shape or something .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Uh .\nUser Interface:Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so I would actually give it a three .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Tha three or four , I'm not sure .\nMarketing:Okay . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Three . Go for three . That's fine .\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:for technology .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I am sort of pret uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well .\nMarketing:Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now {disfmarker} our fashion trend shows that people like everything {disfmarker} all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them {gap} or showing some association with them .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So that is also ef that also {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen {gap} . So we can {disfmarker} Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Well it was yellow . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um {vocalsound} there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy a {vocalsound} two .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Is that the question ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Is it ? Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um .\nUser Interface:Okay , so {vocalsound} one or two .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll go with two .\nMarketing:So what about you , Brian ?\nProject Manager:Um yeah , a three . Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a {disfmarker} a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So one and a half .\nMarketing:half .\nUser Interface:Yeah , one .\nMarketing:So we can say two or one {gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:A two . {gap}\nMarketing:Okay . So th seven seven . Uh overall we are getting two {gap} something , but we can round it as two .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good .\nProject Manager:Cool , groovy . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:S\nMarketing:So we can launch it . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Cool . Brilliant . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Woo-hoo .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} In which case we are done . 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Cool .\nMarketing:So\nProject Manager:Champagne lunch anyone ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah . {vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\n",
        "summary": "In this meeting, the team was very satisfied with the three prototypes presented. However, they had to take the budget limits into consideration. Their current cost per remote control was fourteen point six Euros, while the budget required them to cut two more Euros. Therefore, a series of changes were done in order to meet the criteria, such as making the remotes flattened. In the end, the team was asked to make an evaluation about the project. All of them were very satisfied with the final product.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:So we are here to talk about functional design . Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from {vocalsound} {disfmarker} than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . So here's an agenda . Uh I'll open . Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} now {vocalsound} you can all give your presentations . We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . {vocalsound} Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . Uh did you all receive that email ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So does anyone have any overall {gap}\nMarketing:Well {vocalsound} uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having {vocalsound} no teletext , people are very comfortable {vocalsound} with {vocalsound} the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not {disfmarker} we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now .\nProject Manager:Mm . Mm . Yep .\nMarketing:So that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Right . Yeah . No , I I agree with you .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that {vocalsound} identifies our product as better than {disfmarker} because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So that's that's that was my reactions .\nProject Manager:Yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:So we're quite fixed . So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product .\nMarketing:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:we not design the T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we {disfmarker} people use our remote with .\nMarketing:Yeah . 'Kay .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:That's right .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's kind of a stupid decision .\nMarketing:I think we take with you .\nProject Manager:But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement {disfmarker} wants it as {vocalsound} cheap as possible . Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess .\nMarketing:That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took {disfmarker} they can't ac access their teletext .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay . 'Cause we're talking about {vocalsound} eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext .\nProject Manager:K yeah .\nMarketing:So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? What are we bringing in to take the place of this ,\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:and we have to d {disfmarker} in my opinion we have to double up .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:If we lose one we need to bring two or three .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay I think that the {vocalsound} last point is probably quite uh straightforward . Obviously the the {disfmarker} w it has to be branded . 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:So then the double R_ will be our our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:On the product yeah . Can you handle that black and yellow ?\nUser Interface:I think one of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry .\nUser Interface:I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this {disfmarker} I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . So I think our kind of {disfmarker} our target here is to {vocalsound} have some kind of very like sleek {vocalsound} nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:You know we don't wanna a big clunker . We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So you have this ?\nProject Manager:Nah . So we have three presentations , and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . That's {disfmarker} {gap} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:That's fine . Okay so\nProject Manager:Mm it's enough . But uh click it on off ?\nUser Interface:so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:We need some kinda of power d power source . Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which {disfmarker} and it receives that signal . You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there . And uh we also need to um have the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . So {vocalsound} those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around .\nMarketing:Now is {disfmarker} would this be {vocalsound} considered just a standard uh um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think any des\nMarketing:This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:We're talking about existing technology .\nUser Interface:Right I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries .\nUser Interface:Yeah this is just {disfmarker} this is just a basic layout of ev {vocalsound} of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that {vocalsound} I mean {vocalsound} that you can kinda say would {vocalsound} would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:Do we have an idea of costs of different components ?\nUser Interface:Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h {vocalsound} you know how much power .\nProject Manager:Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? No .\nUser Interface:Uh I don't have any figures right now .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um but {disfmarker} and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think .\nMarketing:N okay . Mm . Mm the shell ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . Basically yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So yeah . That's all I have really .\nProject Manager:Okay . Thanks . And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I can give you that to click on .\nIndustrial Designer:Hey mouse .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Open . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And you wanna get {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:When we're fighting over it's also more {disfmarker} lot more fun . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:View a slide show , that's what you wanna do , yeah ? Just go up to view .\nUser Interface:Click , don't {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay\nIndustrial Designer:This doesn't work . {vocalsound} So yeah function design . Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . Um something cute and small . The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh {disfmarker} that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the {disfmarker} to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their {disfmarker} the stations . There's no need to have that in the remote . So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but {vocalsound} um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But I t I think what the {vocalsound} the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Because otherwise we're just going to {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} even if it's necessary or not , if you {disfmarker} if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really {disfmarker} if it i {vocalsound} if it isn't more expensive for us to k make {disfmarker} because as far as I understand it , {vocalsound} it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? So it should be in there .\nUser Interface:Right as far as {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:i it's just uh {vocalsound} the cost of an extra button . I mean software-wise there's really no difference .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay . Isn't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I have maybe a silly question . I {disfmarker} in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the {disfmarker} it's gonna be out-moded teletext . I I don't understand how those two things are connected . How does how does computers and teletext {disfmarker} h how {disfmarker} why is one eliminating the need of the other ? I don't understand that .\nProject Manager:Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . So that might play on what we can do .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that {vocalsound} you would use {disfmarker} you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that\nUser Interface:Scheduling . Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know .\nIndustrial Designer:and now {disfmarker} Yeah\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and now you can c look it over Internet . But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities .\nUser Interface:I think I ha I agree .\nMarketing:Yeah 'cause , yeah , I just {disfmarker} I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but it's not happen yet . Yeah .\nMarketing:but but but but with the {disfmarker} the remote is is used for television , okay .\nUser Interface:Well for me {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well you have digital T_V_ still already .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . S\nUser Interface:Unless you have a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well there there is a {disfmarker} for example on digital T_V_ systems you have {disfmarker} you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can {disfmarker} Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . That's the thing . And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . I don't think .\nProject Manager:Mm . But still there there's an opportunity . If if it's {vocalsound} , for example , a trainable one then we're {vocalsound} just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I dunno . One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs .\nUser Interface:I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . Just you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah I don't I don't see the logic .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , I just I I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , and neither do I in fact .\nMarketing:but I'm not a tech-mind either . I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and\nProject Manager:Bu uh .\nMarketing:{disfmarker} 'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price .\nUser Interface:Right it's just not\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe .\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:We are selling it to an existing market .\nProject Manager:I dunno I'm {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but we're not putting some {disfmarker} there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext .\nMarketing:That's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:That's the problem .\nMarketing:and and , yeah , and and we're also {vocalsound} marketing a product . It's {disfmarker} what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . So if we drop {disfmarker} if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ?\nProject Manager:Hmm . So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . I need to make it special with a high price tag . I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I want I want to market it as exclusive . So I would market this product it {disfmarker} at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really {vocalsound} beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility .\nProject Manager:But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden {disfmarker} stan standard T_V_ so the place {disfmarker} uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant {vocalsound} high-priced basic remote . Does that make sense , huh ?\nMarketing:No I no I I understand what you say ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:but what I'm what I'm , okay {disfmarker} we probably need to move along ,\nProject Manager:Yeah we probably should .\nMarketing:but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product ,\nProject Manager:We we're doing alright for time .\nMarketing:and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So that's just my question , but we can keep talking .\nProject Manager:Okay . Sorry that kinda cut into you there .\nIndustrial Designer:No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Right . I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people {vocalsound} how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do {vocalsound} to use all these functions . Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna {disfmarker} you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . They want something that looks nice , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share .\nProject Manager:So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . Is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh {disfmarker} for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think {vocalsound} you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ?\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Maybe five percent , you know ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah mm .\nProject Manager:But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this .\nUser Interface:and how much {disfmarker} Right . Yeah okay .\nProject Manager:Be a good idea .\nUser Interface:I'm sorry .\nProject Manager:Uh sorry , I didn't mean to cut in {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Sorry boss {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:I'm not the boss {vocalsound} . Okay .\nMarketing:Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:You know sell uh {disfmarker} things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh {vocalsound} um voice-activated . I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think that's probably a question more for for this guy here , yeah .\nMarketing:Is that for over here ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well it's kinda both of us .\nMarketing:Okay , alright .\nProject Manager:Is it ?\nUser Interface:Us us user interface .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:That's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated I think of of {vocalsound} how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . I was thinking about that . Then your lights would go off , though . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:uh and and so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But this 's just something . I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? What makes this thing attractive ? And it's only for televisions . So we {disfmarker} everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their {vocalsound} their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only . And so to me we have to make this a really special product\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . At this price I don't see it yet . I'm {disfmarker} I I go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:But we th that should be design .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That should be the design basically .\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:I think technology we'd we {disfmarker} we're not in the price range to do it . We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design .\nMarketing:Okay . Have to do {disfmarker} you have to do it in the box ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay well , so so that's up to you then to {vocalsound} to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Maybe make it in the form of a gun . We can sell it in United States .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I have a question uh for you . Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? In terms of making it work or the cost of that or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I don't {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think all these things are pretty standard . I think we'll be okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . 'Kay . Cheers . Onto participant {vocalsound} four . {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well {vocalsound} you know for marketing f {vocalsound} marketing for me is uh {disfmarker} and uh how do I go here ? Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm you can just click .\nMarketing:Go go .\nUser Interface:No no no\nMarketing:Is that right ?\nUser Interface:you just get off that . You just click anywhere .\nMarketing:Ah-ha . Yeah , what for me is it um {disfmarker} I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . I just know that I I was identified as a a {disfmarker} we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:That's what we decided here . Um so what I did is I I decided that {vocalsound} that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um {vocalsound} so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together , um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some {disfmarker} I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . I don't know . These are just thoughts . Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . So to me it's about selling d uh our identity {disfmarker} our corporate identity along with the product . {vocalsound} Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for {disfmarker} I I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . If if we could have a technological something {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I have an idea .\nMarketing:Mm p please .\nUser Interface:And it's kind of {vocalsound} along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um what we can do is , well you know that batteries {disfmarker} throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . Right ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Solar . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And {vocalsound} s for some people {disfmarker} Yeah {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ?\nMarketing:But solar {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . You never have to get {disfmarker} go through the {disfmarker} go through {vocalsound} uh all these different batteries . And also you can {disfmarker} I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design {disfmarker} or for {disfmarker} not just for the user design , but also for the {disfmarker} just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , {vocalsound} a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Blah , I like it . I like the idea , but we're talking about {disfmarker} in cost is gonna probably double .\nUser Interface:It w it would increase the cost .\nMarketing:But boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form .\nUser Interface:And you could page the remote if you lose it . Maybe there's a button on the cradle .\nMarketing:Yep , that's right . I really see\nProject Manager:Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ?\nMarketing:But the cost i No no . No no , we have t we have to change the end cost .\nProject Manager:We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh {vocalsound} Can we dl can we do that without {vocalsound} uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ?\nMarketing:There's uh {disfmarker} I mean I don't see it anyway . Yeah , that's gonna be up to these guys .\nUser Interface:Well\nMarketing:I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} my reaction is no , but\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers .\nProject Manager:Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well , see I I {disfmarker} see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls .\nUser Interface:I {vocalsound} I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Every home's got to have it . If you don't have one , hey what kind of remote do you have ? Oh you've got one of those , oh fantastic , I want one of those too .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I just don't have enough money right now .\nUser Interface:I just don't know about that , because in order to do that {vocalsound} {disfmarker} in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Nah , I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yep , one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . They say they say okay here you go . They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . I don't know what kind of role we have in this {disfmarker} in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your {disfmarker} here's our ideas , okay .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:And then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , but {vocalsound} to me it's it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? beca I I do not {disfmarker} I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:I don I I d\nMarketing:I don't see it .\nUser Interface:I have to disagree though . I think our market niche is basically people who need {vocalsound} {disfmarker} who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . It does what they need . These aren't {disfmarker} I I think that it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh uh {vocalsound} for cutting in but , I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 'cause it's selling on its own .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or or whatever .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:No I understand that .\nProject Manager:So technologically , if I understand it , uh T_V_s {vocalsound} T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code .\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:So saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Nope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions .\nProject Manager:Oh okay okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah y y you you wouldn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:They've identified this product limita\nProject Manager:We have done this .\nMarketing:That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this .\nIndustrial Designer:The interface will be different .\nProject Manager:I see .\nMarketing:If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable ,\nUser Interface:Well here's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And I I'd {disfmarker}\nMarketing:because who wants just a television remote ?\nProject Manager:Mm sorry .\nUser Interface:Right . We he well here's my thing about that .\nMarketing:I don't . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . If it can't control {disfmarker} if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just {disfmarker} you can throw all your other remotes away . I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote .\nMarketing:That's right . {vocalsound} I I I have a tendency to agree with you . I really do .\nProject Manager:So we really can't chase that .\nMarketing:That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . I really question where we create the demand .\nUser Interface:So I think what we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We're really looking for something basic .\nUser Interface:So that's what I'm saying {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . We're selling more than just the product . We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . We want people to eventually say , oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . It's reliable . And and we're gonna make it {disfmarker} we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , {vocalsound} and solid . So if we can make {disfmarker} if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely {vocalsound} big thing .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . I think that's big .\nMarketing:W {vocalsound} okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make {disfmarker} go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da .\nIndustrial Designer:Good design .\nProject Manager:We only have a few minutes left .\nMarketing:But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market .\nProject Manager:Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah\nUser Interface:I think so , yeah .\nMarketing:for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:and that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . So to me {vocalsound} , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I don't know what that is . It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features .\nProject Manager:Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but we're really doing that to sell the brand . Yep we have five minutes left . Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions .\nMarketing:Or my d {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And I can communicate this to to the more senior {vocalsound} uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? How do you feel about that ?\nProject Manager:Well how does everybody feel ?\nUser Interface:Or how does everybody feel ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I mean I I {vocalsound} well we g we're talking about the other end now .\nProject Manager:{gap} I I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I like it .\nUser Interface:No , but I {disfmarker} that's the thing I I don't think it's necessarily the other end .\nMarketing:I like the idea , but we have t we have to find out {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would I wanna buy that ? And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . It {disfmarker} i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . So it's very good for some people but it's not a like {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well it lasts {disfmarker} it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle .\nProject Manager:But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent .\nUser Interface:Yeah\nProject Manager:You have to l sort of remember .\nUser Interface:well it {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I d I d I d I think it it {disfmarker} in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:But I I don't know , that's just my opinion .\nMarketing:Well , I think again it's it {disfmarker} we have a cost issue here . You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Are we gonna make this {disfmarker} selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? {vocalsound} Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:I don't see it yet .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So what do we think maybe we should {disfmarker} Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good .\nMarketing:W {vocalsound} a question I have in in a {vocalsound} {disfmarker} 'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing .\nProject Manager:Really need to wrap up now .\nMarketing:Can can can we have multiple designs ? Have a modern , have a traditional , have a {disfmarker} you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . I don't know what that creates cost , or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yep one over another . Yeah , okay , I hear that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , complicated but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um but what we could do is some kind of {vocalsound} well I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it has to feel good in your hand ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . Even though the cost may be low .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:What ab what ab {disfmarker} what about a a remote that's {vocalsound} that {vocalsound} doesn't maybe look like a remote ? Just an idea .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Just just okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . They're selling these things everywhere . Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone .\nUser Interface:Or what if it looks like a pen ?\nMarketing:Doesn't matter , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I'm just jus I talking about some {disfmarker} something to make this thing unique .\nUser Interface:A pointer ?\nMarketing:It {disfmarker} That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I'll sell whatever you guys design .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't have a problem selling a product , that's not the issue . I give you ideas , you guys create the product . Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . Don't worry about it . I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings .\nUser Interface:So\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:just {vocalsound} to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . Um I really {vocalsound} {disfmarker} un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like {disfmarker} for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that .\nProject Manager:I mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that that worked uh , this hasn't been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch .\nUser Interface:A lot of people {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No no .\nUser Interface:As a watch ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , there is remote control watches um ,\nUser Interface:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:but I think they're a sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it {disfmarker} uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah they are not simple .\nProject Manager:Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's what I was saying .\nMarketing:We gotta stop ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Gotta cut up .\nMarketing:Who's lost or broken their their remote . So {vocalsound} how many remotes do they wanna buy ? Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ?\nUser Interface:Exactly .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:How does this happen ?\nProject Manager:The last remote you'll ever buy .\nUser Interface:And also presumably they've {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy .\nProject Manager:Well if if we're going down that then we can {disfmarker} we don't need to go the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Exactly .\nProject Manager:it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones\nUser Interface:True .\nProject Manager:you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there .\nUser Interface:Right . Yeah . The locator'll definitely be more expensive . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet . We really need to finish up here . But uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap} uh {disfmarker} we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah we have the {gap} the power-adaptor products . We sell power-adaptor products . So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology .\nMarketing:It's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about .\nProject Manager:Yeah I think so ,\nMarketing:A charging system .\nProject Manager:without it being too {disfmarker} In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:You know , something like that .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Thanks guys .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:No that's not what I want , I want {disfmarker} Oh look it here .\n",
        "summary": "The group had a heated discussion over the functional design and the market positioning of their new product. First, User Interface introduced the basic components of the remote control and the cost of them. When discussing the user interface design, the group agreed that the product should be good-looking and branded with their company logo. Industrial Designer thought they should keep the functions simple and basic and aimed at the exterior design. Then, the group talked much about the teletext and whether the controller should be only for TV. When it came to the market positioning, the opinion of User Interface differed from Marketing's - the former tended to keep it simple but the latter thought there should be something special about the product to make it exclusive.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Is everyone ready to start ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . Great . Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running . Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The meeting will be forty minutes long .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Should be just loading . {vocalsound} Okay . Oh , although I can't see it on my screen . That says go here . Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . {vocalsound} There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} What is a hand-powered dynamo ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , where you manually charge up the power .\nProject Manager:Just every , every once in a while ?\nIndustrial Designer:Like you wind up something .\nProject Manager:Just every once in a while or constantly ?\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry ? Yeah . Every once in a while I think\nProject Manager:Alright . It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think .\nIndustrial Designer:. But it's {disfmarker} Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology .\nProject Manager:No . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Because you can't really see which way round it is .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , we also can choose what materials {disfmarker} um , the {disfmarker} we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Wood .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um , again , stepping back in time again there .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects . Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some {disfmarker} we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , {disfmarker} they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we would have to have an L_C_D_ um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That's true .\nProject Manager:display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .\nIndustrial Designer:And that would lead to an advanced {disfmarker} yeah . If we have {disfmarker} yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . {gap} . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different {disfmarker} depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton . Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sounds brilliant to me .\nProject Manager:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these {vocalsound} chips and diodes and delicate technology as\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:like as the exterior . This is the one thing that's protecting its innards .\nIndustrial Designer:I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Another thing is it might be more difficult {disfmarker} if it's a rubber exterior {gap} talking about putting on interchangeable plates .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , is it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case .\nUser Interface:W\nIndustrial Designer:So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .\nUser Interface:Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like {disfmarker} I can't think of what .\nUser Interface:Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Or like an {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:b like a Nokia it is .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just {disfmarker} it's protective as well .\nUser Interface:It's {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Like the skin ?\nIndustrial Designer:It , it stops it , I mean ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright . So maybe the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:And then {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And the buttons obviously are rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That sounds good . I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?\nIndustrial Designer:As far as I know . It should be .\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we'll just say yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , just why not .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright . I like the kinetic energy source idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot .\nIndustrial Designer:I thought that was {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um\nUser Interface:Yeah , tha\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:energy source . It could make an we could have any kind of style .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Just for environmental reasons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it seems {disfmarker} we'd have to do more research on it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .\nIndustrial Designer:Like as a backup for something .\nUser Interface:Backup . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So , if it was running off of one battery as a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That would be good yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Some alternative just in case something went wrong .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Maybe we could {disfmarker} you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power .\nIndustrial Designer:That's true . I just thought of that {gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:So maybe that could be incorporated as {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:May maybe that could be the backup .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Instead of a battery .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like solar backup .\nMarketing:Although it needs some light , doesn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I suppose\nProject Manager:Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then .\nUser Interface:Do , do those calculators {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:s but some {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So , if we're doing {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:yeah . If we're {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But thing is , it's not {disfmarker} you don't need the solar all the time .\nUser Interface:I don't know how it works .\nIndustrial Designer:It can be stored . It can be like {disfmarker} you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like a few hours a day . {gap} .\nProject Manager:I think that might be a little impractical though .\nMarketing:Yeah . I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's true . It could easily {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Like people don't wanna have to worry about that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it works .\nProject Manager:Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I suppose .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Alright . Cool .\nIndustrial Designer:K okay .\nProject Manager:'S that the end of your presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:There we go .\nUser Interface:Thanks . Oh . {vocalsound} It's not on my screen .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} it wasn't on mine either .\nUser Interface:Why ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know why . I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there .\nUser Interface:You don't know why ? Oh okay . Is it that one ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or {vocalsound} by the human user . And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about .\nProject Manager:Oh . Okay . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I'm not really sure about the pictures that {disfmarker} maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Or maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Do you think it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , 'cause {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So I suppose sometime {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I'm sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:after you . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have {disfmarker} like the power would be s some kind of symbol .\nUser Interface:Like an L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer:And if you wanted to go onto teletext or ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you , they have {disfmarker} there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which {disfmarker} I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that .\nProject Manager:Yeah , we'll be doing {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It'd be more a command interface , and then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:The infrared is like , that's considered a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm ?\nUser Interface:No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per\nMarketing:Okay . So when it says pointing device that doesn't include {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:For inp\nUser Interface:Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:to make it more simplistic . But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:as in {disfmarker} just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What do you mean ?\nUser Interface:Like {vocalsound} I can't think of an example , but {disfmarker} Sort of like little pictures rather than {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh yeah , like how the buttons {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Like a little sound . Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something .\nProject Manager:Yeah , as a button though .\nUser Interface:Yeah , something y\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ?\nUser Interface:Yeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah . I like that idea .\nUser Interface:Um , the co uh {disfmarker} we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . A bit more too , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That's true . That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . And that all interfaces are different . So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:Does anyone have any questions ?\nProject Manager:Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and if we wanted to ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .\nUser Interface:But um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But what about the lighting up effect ?\nMarketing:You mean different colours for the lighting or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would {disfmarker} if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Oh I see what you're saying .\nProject Manager:If they were white they would glow , probably .\nMarketing:Well y\nProject Manager:If they were made out of rubber .\nMarketing:Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nMarketing:But , but I guess , you mean from the back .\nProject Manager:Where would the light come from ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:and well rubber is a more translucent product too ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:so we have that taken care of .\nIndustrial Designer:It should be able to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:Li yeah .\nUser Interface:So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . Do you know what I mean ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:'Cause it's just the wee control ,\nMarketing:Yeah . They , they insert over .\nUser Interface:yeah , thing that's behind it .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Well , if they're raised up buttons . So that you can feel them .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We were talking about it being more um , a lot more tangible .\nMarketing:T\nProject Manager:Um , it might be more difficult to do . If they're , if they're sticking up .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think it would be possible . I don't think it would make that much difference . I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . And then you get to the circuit . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm sure that'd be fine . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Alright . If it's do-able we can do .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , sounds good to me .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So that's everything , then ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Alright , thank you .\nMarketing:Okay is that my turn then ?\nProject Manager:That means you're up . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Alright . {vocalsound} I have a shorter report for you today . Um , it took a while to get this , uh {disfmarker} Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:You're not plugged in yet .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's a very good point .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . Um , {vocalsound} so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying . The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the {disfmarker} face-plates . Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . {vocalsound} So , pretty basic there . And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . {vocalsound} Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . Um {disfmarker} So , my personal preferences here , um of course , as {disfmarker} we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It could be one of the options .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . Everything else we can really , we can really\nIndustrial Designer:It is strange .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's , it's a little {gap} but it , it's everywhere .\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So maybe we {disfmarker} I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But they still need to um fit into people's decor though .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Or colour schemes .\nIndustrial Designer:We {disfmarker} I think we possibly could take a more abstract design .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or a strawberry seed or a leaf .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:The {disfmarker} The essence of strawberry . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:just {disfmarker} if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit {disfmarker} yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy {disfmarker} well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But {vocalsound} may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit .\nProject Manager:Tone it down . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah and like not , not {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I guess , yeah .\nProject Manager:like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:Or banana-shaped . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:One thing I was thinking though is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And , did you have any questions ? Pretty straightforward ?\nProject Manager:Yeah um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again .\nMarketing:There you go . {vocalsound} Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I didn't for the first one . But I have now .\nMarketing:okay .\nProject Manager:But it's still around right ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . Uh , hopefully\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Where do you have to save it to ?\nIndustrial Designer:. Project documents I think .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . I'm just trying to make this pop up now . Alright . Here we go . Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . So energy , we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:oh . Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Does anyone know how to take it out of {disfmarker} Um ,\nUser Interface:Just escape I think .\nMarketing:The PowerPoint ?\nProject Manager:yeah . Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Kinetic yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , so that's good .\nIndustrial Designer:Are we going to have a backup ?\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Or do we just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But would a backup really be necessary ? I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's ,\nIndustrial Designer:I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy ,\nProject Manager:if there is backup .\nIndustrial Designer:and be bold and innovative ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and hope this works , and well hope that it works .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . I think {disfmarker} no . I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . It could even be one of our selling points .\nIndustrial Designer:Go for it . It could be {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:fully kinetic energy .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Environmentally conscious or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Is everyone happy with that ?\nMarketing:So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Hope so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Alright , the next um decision is chip on print . I don't exactly know what that means .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it was {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so that was without the L_C_D_ . So that means we're not doing the advanced .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .\nProject Manager:I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , so that's the simple .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I don\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah possibly .\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's a medium .\nProject Manager:That's called medium , or regular ?\nIndustrial Designer:So regular chip . Regular sorry . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Regular chip .\nMarketing:Oh , is regular not simple ?\nIndustrial Designer:Lighting .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah if we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's for the lighting , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .\nMarketing:Right right right .\nProject Manager:Okay , and cases . Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ?\nIndustrial Designer:So th I think this is just like gonna be the {disfmarker} a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:Rubber .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Plastic with rubber\nIndustrial Designer:Plastic rubber coat .\nUser Interface:plastic coat .\nProject Manager:coating and interchangeable um\nIndustrial Designer:Interchangeable , yeah . Still going for that .\nProject Manager:yeah , interchangeable plates .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . User interface concept . This is your time to shine .\nUser Interface:We decided on the component . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um {vocalsound} PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Your screen ?\nMarketing:Think it was called command interface .\nIndustrial Designer:Was it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh , yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Command interface , {gap} .\nUser Interface:The command inter\nProject Manager:Command interface .\nIndustrial Designer:Ouch .\nUser Interface:The command line interface yeah .\nProject Manager:Did you say command line ? Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Line interface .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright , and supplements . What's that all about ?\nUser Interface:Um , I think that is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the {disfmarker} in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ?\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:We haven't really decided what to do about that .\nProject Manager:Um , what are our choices here ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ?\nProject Manager:You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?\nIndustrial Designer:The power . Volume .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So pretty {disfmarker} just just the basic button functions .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:May yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Tone , contrast , and things . That's a bit {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That was on , um one of my presentations . About how often it was used .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it was minima\nMarketing:Do you remember that ?\nIndustrial Designer:well , it wasn't the l\nProject Manager:Yeah , it was hardly ever used really .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I w {vocalsound} Should I bring it up ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . And most televisions will come with a remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That would be good . Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , each television .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:'Kay , well we know we want numbers .\nMarketing:The ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . So tw twice every {disfmarker} once every two hours . Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . That's brightness , colour , tone , all that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself ,\nUser Interface:You don't change that often , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:doesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it does .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and different televisions .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:changes like that .\nIndustrial Designer:So we're just going for power , channels , volume ,\nProject Manager:Volume .\nMarketing:The other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , relevance of two .\nProject Manager:Oh . We have five minutes to finish our meeting .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Crap . Okay , um , let's do this fast . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well that didn't some up on mine .\nProject Manager:Should we have audio ? It only comes up on mine usually .\nUser Interface:It w {vocalsound} it would seem silly if we'd {gap} having anything else , just have an audio button though .\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Do you know ?\nProject Manager:I don't , I {disfmarker} it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we know that everyone has this and it's the same .\nUser Interface:But we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I've {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , {vocalsound} mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's it . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic .\nUser Interface:That could be a sales pitch .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Simple and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah uh I {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:brilliant .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Good . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . Wait a minute . Is that right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product . Um , Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Alright . So , anyone else have something to say ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Are we {disfmarker} seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ?\nMarketing:Now do you guys need {disfmarker} want an idea of how many uh {disfmarker} are you gonna come up with casing ideas ?\nIndustrial Designer:Y Yeah .\nMarketing:Like f five different {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap} five . {gap} .\nUser Interface:What I {disfmarker} What I was thinking {disfmarker} what do yous think of this ? Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Like grapes . Like that's kind of fruity or something .\nMarketing:Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We can have a look at those ideas , yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . Something that your granny would want on her remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , and international tastes as well , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Tricky . {vocalsound} A lot of things to consider . Hm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Not easy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Lots of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah . Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright . And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Bye .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I'll see you later . {vocalsound} Oh , what did I just do . Okay .\n",
        "summary": "This was the third meeting of conceptual design, including three presentations and a conclusive discussion to make some specific decisions. First, Industrial Designer introduced and led to a discussion about different options for the components of the circuit board, the energy sources, and the materials of casing and button. Next, User Interface gave the second presentation about interface concept and two types of user interfaces: the graphical user interface and the command interface, and strongly recommended the latter. The last presentation by Marketing reported the trend-watching for remote control and the relevant discussion centralized the trendy theme of vegetable and fruit. Given all of the information, the group eventually decided on some special designs, such as the kinetic energy, the regular chip, the plastic rubber coat, the interchangeable plate, the command line interface, and the basic buttons.",

Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . So ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:hope you have good ideas . I don't . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I did my best .\nProject Manager:Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design ,\nIndustrial Designer:Not yet .\nProject Manager:then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh well you know how to {disfmarker} the documents work . So {disfmarker} Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Operations .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It doesn't always work . Yes .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay so you can draw .\nMarketing:Draw . Alright .\nProject Manager:Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . Okay ?\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain {disfmarker} Uh with different colours and with different pen widths .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And you should explain why you draw that particular animal .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Don't take up too much space . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , Julian .\nUser Interface:Um yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Different pen widths , how do you do that ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh with the format menu .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh okay .\nProject Manager:And use different colours etcetera .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's a giraffe . Yeah .\nProject Manager:And {vocalsound} what's that supposed to be ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Are you serious ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Should it be one {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Oh yeah\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:four legs . Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Giraffe's yellow . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh {disfmarker} Oh format .\nMarketing:Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:so y you must save it at the end\nProject Manager:Yeah\nMarketing:and then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:you can press the next button , which is uh {disfmarker} yeah . I'll show you .\nUser Interface:That's some spots .\nIndustrial Designer:I in the file option menu .\nProject Manager:Yeah . In file menu .\nMarketing:Okay ,\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:then m make a new one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:How much time do we have to draw anyway ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause I can take forever on this .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Okay . Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think it's a it's a great animal .\nProject Manager:What is it ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's a it's a giraffe .\nProject Manager:A giraffe okay . Yeah I see a long neck\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's more like a dinosaur . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye .\nProject Manager:Okay . That's nice of you .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh .\nUser Interface:Hey . Come on .\nMarketing:Some leaf to eat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah pretty good . Uh could you press the next uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:The next ? Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . Then uh {disfmarker} {gap} .\nUser Interface:Here you go . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Thanks .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ?\nProject Manager:Yeah sorry , introduction and get acquainted\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nProject Manager:That's the idea , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . Your line broke .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah it's a bit slow ,\nMarketing:It's not that fast .\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I see . It misses the spot .\nProject Manager:{gap} pressure .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm guessing a turtle . No . {vocalsound} I'm kidding .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I say good guess . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Why a turtle ?\nIndustrial Designer:Because of its shell .\nMarketing:Because it's slow . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's slow .\nUser Interface:'Cause it's so\nProject Manager:You were slow too\nUser Interface:'cause it's green . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah I was a bit slow too .\nIndustrial Designer:Dude you're a good drawer .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh some other line uh width uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Do you have a turtle pet ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay .\nMarketing:I dunno . {vocalsound} Does it have legs ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah sure .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nProject Manager:Yeah not exactly legs but {disfmarker} More like fins\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Stumpy stuff .\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's more like a tank . Yeah that's fins\nIndustrial Designer:They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on .\nMarketing:but I don't know where . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Some spots . Ah some eye .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it's l looks very friendly . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah that's a fr {vocalsound} friendly turtle I guess .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough .\nProject Manager:Yeah okay .\nIndustrial Designer:A little tail maybe .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Right . {vocalsound} I don't know what the position is . {vocalsound} Does it have ears ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh no .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:No . Oh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The little holes maybe .\nMarketing:Can you erase ears\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:There's a a gum ,\nMarketing:Yeah ? Alright .\nProject Manager:gum to {gap} .\nMarketing:Eraser .\nIndustrial Designer:And why did you choose this animal ?\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:He said it was slow .\nMarketing:I dunno . I it just came into my mind . So there's no particular reason\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:I {gap} pen .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I like it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Well I'm {disfmarker} guess I'm done .\nProject Manager:Okay . {gap}\nMarketing:That's my turtle .\nProject Manager:Your turn Niels .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:How to select the next or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The next\nMarketing:here .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Colours were under format\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Makes new paper .\nMarketing:Here you go .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:right ? Let's see .\nProject Manager:Orange .\nIndustrial Designer:How am I gonna do this ? Um {disfmarker} Mm uh .\nUser Interface:A rabbit I think .\nProject Manager:Kangaroo .\nUser Interface:Kangaroo . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Not quite actually .\nUser Interface:Fox .\nMarketing:A fox yeah .\nProject Manager:Dog .\nMarketing:Firefox .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:Cat .\nIndustrial Designer:Aye . {vocalsound} It's a cat .\nProject Manager:It's a cat .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Not quite yet through .\nMarketing:A cat who had an accident or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Why a cat ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah I dunno . They're my favourite pets .\nProject Manager:You have some uh ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I have colour already . Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} The pen ,\nIndustrial Designer:st Oh shit . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Excuse my language .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Sure . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know how to draw its face . But you get the idea .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a cat . It's my favourite uh pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:That's it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or do I need to use more colours and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} I think it's okay . You get idea\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nProject Manager:right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay um\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we have a financial aspect to this project . {vocalsound} Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh the aim is to reach {disfmarker} uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money . And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . Okay\nIndustrial Designer:So we have to s\nProject Manager:now it's time for some discussion . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What uh what uh do you want to discuss ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We should get started .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh I'm taking notes . Um\nMarketing:Okay . Great .\nProject Manager:we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . I didn't know if you received the same mail .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:I guess so . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay so the um {vocalsound} uh {gap} this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ?\nIndustrial Designer:True .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So I had to uh , {vocalsound} I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points . Uh {vocalsound} according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And that's basically all I have so far .\nProject Manager:Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Wireless uh {disfmarker} huh .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So that's very common .\nUser Interface:Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the {disfmarker} to all the channels and changing the volume . That are the the basic options for a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah I kept it global 'cause {vocalsound} {disfmarker} that it activates or deactivates specific functions ,\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but you might wanna use teletext also .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno what the word is in English . Uh {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Same I believe {gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?\nMarketing:Uh well from a marketing uh {vocalsound} perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research {vocalsound} uh to see what existing products are there out in the market .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I mean , what functions do they have .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ?\nProject Manager:Yep . Yes .\nMarketing:So we can see uh what needs to be supported . Um {vocalsound} and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users ,\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add .\nProject Manager:Okay . And you can get that information ?\nMarketing:I think I can get that information , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . That would be very handy .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ?\nMarketing:No n not specifically .\nProject Manager:No ?\nMarketing:More to how to get them\nProject Manager:No okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I got some uh requirements\nMarketing:and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:it has uh {gap} it has to be user-friendly .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Of course .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Obviously .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh {disfmarker} yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine .\nProject Manager:Big , mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh what do you mean by that ?\nUser Interface:Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It has to be capable for zapping uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . From the other end of the room or something ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay um {disfmarker} Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . Um I think the best is to go to work .\nIndustrial Designer:Whoa . Is that you\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:or {disfmarker} alright .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Any more points to discuss ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . So {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nProject Manager:that was it for me .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:'Kay . Thanks .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Are you going to put the the notes on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . The pro okay .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I'm writing very fast . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Hope it's readable .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Uh .\nProject Manager:Okay {vocalsound} um anything more you want to add to the discussion ?\nMarketing:I guess so .\nIndustrial Designer:Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Because then we have a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:After that we are going to the conceptual uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Y you do some individual work ,\nMarketing:We're just working the three phases .\nProject Manager:we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare {disfmarker} uh I have to defend our design ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so make it good . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah okay . We'll do our best .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:I depend on you .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Better make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in .\nProject Manager:Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Do we {disfmarker} I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} That is my question also\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:because like new new functions {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I think that is the user requirements part .\nMarketing:Requirements . Yeah .\nProject Manager:As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . True .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But but we need good communication about this stuff ,\nMarketing:Unit .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause I have to f put the components into the design .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I would first m\nIndustrial Designer:So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard .\nMarketing:Yeah well\nProject Manager:Yeah I understand .\nMarketing:I I was {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them .\nMarketing:Yeah\nProject Manager:You can always add a few {disfmarker}\nMarketing:well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So you can switch to your video\nProject Manager:Hmm ,\nMarketing:and then the same buttons control your video .\nProject Manager:the C_D_ player . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And then use your Windows media centre {vocalsound} under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch {gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player .\nMarketing:S\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function .\nMarketing:Yeah\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And you you don't need that for a T_V_ .\nMarketing:records and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer:And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well ,\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:You need additional {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so I kind of need to know what we uh need .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting .\nMarketing:In the project uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So we have a basic starting point\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So it's hasn't {gap} {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Th the least amount of functions possible\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I understand . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , you're di dismissed .\nUser Interface:Can we leave now\nMarketing:Half an hour .\nUser Interface:or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Thanks . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You're fired . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Not yet .\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Alright let's move on .\nProject Manager:Let's see what we got to do .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} See you later .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah see you later .\nUser Interface:Good luck . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Thank you .\nMarketing:Well good luck . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:What the {disfmarker}\n",
        "summary": "In their first meeting, the team members got familiar with each other through some icebreaker games. Project Manager started to introduce the new remote control project with the team's financial goal. The unit price was determined to be 25 Euros. The production of each remote control would cost 12.5 Euros. The team would have to make sales amounting to 50 million Euros. Project Manager continued to assign individual tasks to the team members. Industrial Designer had worked out a rough plan for the first phase and would produce a working design. User Interface was supposed to specify the technical functions. Marketing would be responsible for market research. Users mainly expect the remote control to be user-friendly and handy. The team decided to focus on the basic functions at the first stage but make sure the extendibility of the functions as well.",

        "conversations": "Marketing:I wanna find our if our remote works .\nProject Manager:Me too . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Um here's the agenda for our last meeting .\nMarketing:Whoohoo .\nProject Manager:Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . Oh , no , let's have the prototype presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay ,\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:you ready ?\nUser Interface:Um sure . You or me ?\nIndustrial Designer:Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it .\nUser Interface:Okay . Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll be the Vanna .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow .\nMarketing:That's nice .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it {disfmarker} just that one button will light up .\nMarketing:Good .\nUser Interface:Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ {vocalsound} which will actually look like our logo .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Great .\nUser Interface:And then on the side you have the buttons . {vocalsound} They're one button , but they kind of push up and down .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:I don't think they're scrolling .\nIndustrial Designer:No . They're just buttons .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Right , yeah . And then {disfmarker} yeah , the buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , {gap} can't see underneath .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock {gap} you know , stick your finger in . Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute ,\nUser Interface:Thumb-shaped .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'd say a single .\nProject Manager:Single . Single sounds good ,\nUser Interface:Single .\nProject Manager:'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's only actually the size of my hand .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Great . Great . I think you did an awesome job .\nMarketing:Yeah , I think it's a beautiful {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Good job , you guys .\nProject Manager:Good job .\nIndustrial Designer:Whoohoo .\nUser Interface:Oh thank you . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Those are really good .\nProject Manager:Alright {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:what's next in our agenda ? Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney .\nMarketing:Okay , it's a PowerPoint presentation . I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . It's under evaluation .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Alright . Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh {disfmarker} yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Feel good meaning what ?\nMarketing:Like does it feel good , like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Physically ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:okay .\nMarketing:yeah , physically .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Sqi {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's just for current trend .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It doesn't really count , you guys .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . But it's {disfmarker} so we do have removable covers , right ?\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:Yeah , well then that's covered .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:And so we n k everybody have that ?\nProject Manager:I'll wait .\nMarketing:Yeah , she's got it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's good . Yeah . Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ?\nProject Manager:Are we going to indi\nUser Interface:True or false , easy to use .\nProject Manager:I say we individually rate {disfmarker} what do you say ?\nMarketing:You guys {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Just orally .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Why not ? We have {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um easy to use . I vote six .\nMarketing:Oh wait , that's false .\nProject Manager:Oh ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:two .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I'd say two as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah , two .\nMarketing:Two . That's what I say .\nProject Manager:Uh hello , we're great .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay , fashionable ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um one .\nIndustrial Designer:At the moment , no .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:No . I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable .\nProject Manager:Me too , very chic . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I thi I would give it a one .\nProject Manager:One , I give it a one .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way .\nProject Manager:Oh , and ma it's a prototype ,\nMarketing:Well , that's that's just like {disfmarker} that's a clay , it's a prototype .\nProject Manager:right .\nUser Interface:Mm I don't think it's that fashionable .\nMarketing:What do you think ?\nUser Interface:I'd give it like three or four .\nProject Manager:Well , now I'm {gap} .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So , the average is about a two .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But then I'm not fashionable , so\nMarketing:Yeah , it's a two .\nProject Manager:Two or three . Two point five .\nUser Interface:don't use my opinion .\nMarketing:That's okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Neither are all o all the customers we have , either .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:does it feel good ?\nProject Manager:Imagine , since we obviously don't have that .\nUser Interface:Does it feel good ?\nMarketing:I feel like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh the shape of it actually does uh .\nProject Manager:And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . It's gonna be curved .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's gonna be thicker .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Depth .\nMarketing:I think it feels good .\nProject Manager:I think so too .\nMarketing:I'll give it a two .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Two .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'll give it a one .\nMarketing:What do you say ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'd say a two .\nProject Manager:Alright , average is two .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Is it technologically innovative ? Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh no , it's fine ,\nProject Manager:Go right ahead . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:you're {disfmarker} I mean you're Project Manager .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um yeah , I mean and it {disfmarker} does it have voice {disfmarker} I mean the phrase recognition on it ?\nProject Manager:Yes . Right ? We were able to do it with that kind of chip .\nUser Interface:Oh right , the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We could do it with the chip , yes . It wasn't {disfmarker} we have no reflection of it on the prototype ,\nMarketing:And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y\nProject Manager:Yeah , right .\nIndustrial Designer:but that's because it's only two dimensions , really .\nProject Manager:That was {disfmarker} 'kay . And we discussed that being included .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , so .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:Then yes , then I would {disfmarker} well it isn't {disfmarker} what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ?\nIndustrial Designer:It {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well we don' have the {disfmarker} you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight .\nMarketing:And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:so I'd probably give it a three .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Even though it is {disfmarker} for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . But it is just a T_V_ remote .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I'd go for a three or four on that one , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah I go four .\nProject Manager:okay , let's go for a three point five .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Three and an half .\nProject Manager:Alright , and the last criteria {disfmarker} is it is it um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Squishy and fruity .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well yeah , so I'd give it a two .\nProject Manager:Well , we've covered that with the\nUser Interface:It's just trendy , basically .\nProject Manager:trendy . Sure . Capable . Very capable .\nIndustrial Designer:It's capable of being squishy and fruity .\nMarketing:Oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:And {vocalsound} it's very important . 'Kay , there we go .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So .\nMarketing:Okay , next .\nProject Manager:Next . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . Good job , team . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} How did you get that in there ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} What ?\nIndustrial Designer:The {vocalsound} slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It does .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It {vocalsound} it does . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That was good .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Very good .\nMarketing:Thanks .\nProject Manager:Alright , let's go back to this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No , that's it . Hmm . Oops . Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance , okay . I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit . 'Kay ? So let me bring that up . Here we go . Alright . Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Two .\nProject Manager:Number of components you plan to use . Do I just put quantity being one battery , or {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:But if it's a {disfmarker} do you wanna go for {disfmarker} this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . Oh , let's just go for a lithium . What do you say ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , let's let's do a lithium .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think uh I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically\nIndustrial Designer:it's {gap} .\nMarketing:We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced ,\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} right .\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , down to the electronics um section . We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so one of those . It is a single-curved , so one of those .\nMarketing:Uh {gap} .\nProject Manager:Oh . What's that ? Yeah , that's correct .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay , down here , case material .\nUser Interface:It's plastic .\nMarketing:We {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Plastic .\nMarketing:plastic .\nUser Interface:And special colour .\nMarketing:And special colour .\nProject Manager:'Kay . {vocalsound} Down here , interface type . We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel .\nUser Interface:No , we don't have the scroll .\nProject Manager:Isn't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:oh those are just regular buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , that's the push-button too , right there .\nUser Interface:Buttons .\nMarketing:But it's {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nProject Manager:This ?\nMarketing:but i so i\nIndustrial Designer:Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:We're really having just push-button interface .\nProject Manager:Okay , so we can just go {disfmarker} um .\nMarketing:But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side .\nIndustrial Designer:But it {disfmarker} that just covers the type of button we're having . Because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button .\nUser Interface:Oh like the {disfmarker} twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and\nIndustrial Designer:Push-button .\nProject Manager:Right I think she's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But we just have push\nUser Interface:push-buttons .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:But we don't have any scrolls .\nProject Manager:I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ?\nMarketing:Like because there's like one interface right here and then {disfmarker} because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ?\nProject Manager:I don't know , they might put us {disfmarker} well , let's just .\nUser Interface:Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ?\nProject Manager:Two or would it be three ?\nIndustrial Designer:Let's call it th\nMarketing:Or three , because of one on each side and one on top .\nUser Interface:Okay , fine . Yeah .\nMarketing:I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . Well less than twenty nine even .\nProject Manager:Okay\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:and we're gonna {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:button supplements {disfmarker} the buttons are no uh okay .\nMarketing:They're a special colour . Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented .\nProject Manager:Are they ? Oh , right .\nUser Interface:And then s\nMarketing:And , they're a special material .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm . Well , we're under cost then . Alright .\nUser Interface:We're over ?\nProject Manager:No , we're under .\nIndustrial Designer:Grand .\nMarketing:We're under .\nProject Manager:Twelve point five is our limit .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:We've got eleven point two .\nUser Interface:Oh , I see .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:So we can go to production .\nProject Manager:We can go to {disfmarker} I dunno what I just did . {vocalsound} Okay . Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . Um did we have a lot of room for creativity ? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , um teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . Now , question is , how do we do this ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Go back .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think we just discuss it .\nProject Manager:Discuss , sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Previous .\nProject Manager:Alright . Who want who would like to go first ?\nIndustrial Designer:We think we got stifled for cri {vocalsound} creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially .\nUser Interface:We didn't have a whiteboard .\nProject Manager:Hmm . Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Oh that's true .\nUser Interface:And no internet .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} No , yeah , that's a good point . 'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ?\nMarketing:Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:We got to choose {disfmarker} basically we had control over {disfmarker} minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it .\nProject Manager:Right , and we got say over what {disfmarker} how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And we're a fashion forward technology company .\nProject Manager:we {disfmarker} yep . You know it .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} right .\nProject Manager:Um what about um the teamwork aspect ? How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think we did well .\nProject Manager:I think ya' did . Did you work well together in there , and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but {disfmarker} no {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Minus that one fight .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Gouges .\nProject Manager:Oh my God ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We hadn't had any ma fallings out .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Irritating .\nIndustrial Designer:Irritating . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Irritating .\nMarketing:Irritating , yeah . Wow that's a {disfmarker} it's definitely a strong one .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The means , the whiteboard didn't work . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:And no internet .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I have to knock that one down a couple notches .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , and no internet .\nUser Interface:Misses . I do .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:There's so much available .\nMarketing:And the digital the digital pens\nUser Interface:Like it's information\nProject Manager:Yeah , digital pens .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I really appreciated those , yeah .\nMarketing:were {disfmarker} they were pretty cool .\nProject Manager:They were fine .\nMarketing:Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The use of the laptops for receiving everything .\nProject Manager:Right , laptops are extremely handy ,\nIndustrial Designer:It was wireless too , so .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:wireless . And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And these things whoa .\nIndustrial Designer:And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . And Big Brother .\nProject Manager:Big brother .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ?\nMarketing:Um we are really gonna sell this .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Ta-da .\nProject Manager:For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think {disfmarker} I mean that's not what technology .\nUser Interface:Well , that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:They look like they did when I was in elementary school ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and that's so old-fashioned to me .\nMarketing:Yeah , 'cause they're pretty and just like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids .\nUser Interface:Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Just the Mac font bothers me even .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh yeah .\nProject Manager:But I do like iPods , go figure .\nMarketing:Yeah , no , iPods {vocalsound} {disfmarker} They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , i iPods are now quite trendy ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and they come in different colours .\nProject Manager:Colours . Exactly . I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh yeah , everybody .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Anyway , so that is definitely at work .\nIndustrial Designer:Not me .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mine is amber .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I didn't have a phone 'til university .\nUser Interface:But the {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only .\nMarketing:Oh .\nUser Interface:I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Look at it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Fashionable chic people will .\nUser Interface:You're kidding .\nMarketing:That is a piece of work .\nUser Interface:No , no .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Wow . Marketing Director says yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No , marketing has to actually create the desire for it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Fashionable people will buy it . Oh , I will create desire . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That's okay . We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . This will help them find the one .\nUser Interface:Ri {vocalsound} They'll be sexy with it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nMarketing:We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh right .\nMarketing:Mm . {vocalsound} That'll sell .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And so the serpent says , use our remote . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:There you go , marketing {gap} .\nUser Interface:Let you loose .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , no .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , we're gonna wrap this up now . Um the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so . Alright , thank you team ,\nIndustrial Designer:Whoohoo . Margaritas for everyone . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you did a great job , it was lovely working with you .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Good .\nMarketing:You too .\nIndustrial Designer:Yay . Thanks to the Project Leader .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Now we know w\n",
        "summary": "This was the last meeting on the remote project. Industrial Designer and User Interface first gave the prototype presentation with a model remote they made based on previous team decisions, showing the design of colours, buttons, and shapes. Marketing then led the discussion on the evaluation criteria of their product, after which the team evaluated the remote in various aspects. As for finance, the team calculated the costs of each component of the remote, finding the total cost under their budget and thus allowing the remote to go into production. Finally, the team talked about their experience in the project process, digressing into a casual discussion on computers, cell phones, and ideas for commercials. The team members thanked each other for their effort.",

Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project . And uh so I'm {disfmarker} present myself . I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself . So I dunno , you can starts .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so my name is Petre {gap} . You can call me Petre {gap} , or Peter if you like . I don't care {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Uh my name's Bob Mor .\nProject Manager:And you are ? In the project ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic .\nMarketing:Oh , sorry .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris . I'm the Marketing Expert for this project .\nIndustrial Designer:Bob ,\nMarketing:Bob yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:okay .\nUser Interface:My name is Hamed Getabdar , and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So , uh , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are {vocalsound} we are going to use during all this project . We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , yeah . So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . So it should be , of course , new and original , and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . That mean it's a very challenging project , and uh uh . So w it's {disfmarker} we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . So , um {disfmarker} So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . Um . Yeah and everything is {disfmarker} will be like this . Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all {disfmarker} during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . So {gap} uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . Mm . Uh {vocalsound} . So uh {disfmarker} {gap} So I will ask you all to do the same .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Just to get used to the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer:So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:I I th I think I should .\nMarketing:Yeah go ahead .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so . Um {vocalsound} . Okay , American , um . Um . I would use the bird . So I tried to sketch it out . I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah . Can you recognise it {vocalsound} as a bird ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay {vocalsound} it's your turn to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , okay . {vocalsound} So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nMarketing:That's its head .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:I dunno if I should go with this {gap} {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh it's okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thanks . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:If it is enough line .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe put it up\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'm sorry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{disfmarker} Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I should get used to the tool , so .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh just wait {gap} a little bit . C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ah probably not .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} They should be remote .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , it {disfmarker} it works like this .\nMarketing:Uh , that's better .\nUser Interface:Okay , thanks .\nMarketing:Your lapel microphone's fallen off .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Are you left-handed ?\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , pity {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Okay . Should I clean ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can . {vocalsound} Oh {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Never mind . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Maybe we should just continue .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , don't worry about it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:{gap} , no worry .\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:You won't draw them , or ?\nProject Manager:You can draw it , if you want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I dunno if I can .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Just try . I would like to see how it looks like .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'm not good very good in drawing . Okay , so this is very {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It's a bird , I think . I dunno what is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No , I think it's clear .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Four . Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . I'm shameful {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh that's good , it's good .\nIndustrial Designer:It's okay . It's in it's indeed beautiful .\nProject Manager:Good .\nMarketing:Yeah , and strong . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Bob . Have to remember it . Bob .\nProject Manager:So good um {disfmarker} So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell {disfmarker} we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . So {gap} n not only for Switzerland , but for the world . Uh . So , um . The {disfmarker} We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro .\nIndustrial Designer:Per unit , I guess .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nIndustrial Designer:Y oh okay .\nProject Manager:Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very {disfmarker} they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nMarketing:So it's frustrated me in the past , th that .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light {vocalsound} , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this . And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh {disfmarker} there are two buttons for volume control .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .\nMarketing:Ah , okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:You know , some slider or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Not just two discrete buttons for volume ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay , n {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but something which {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nMarketing:Is that because the {disfmarker} of the discrete volume levels , or is that\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but I can reach {disfmarker} In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .\nProject Manager:{gap} Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could {gap} {disfmarker} the the volume can go up very quickly\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah , n .\nProject Manager:and it can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that .\nProject Manager:you have a heart attack {vocalsound} . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if {gap} you have some more notes on that .\nProject Manager:Yeah so you can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh I {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Do you have something ?\nUser Interface:just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's true . Yeah without obstacles and {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . Let's continue .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um . So we will close uh this meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , just a second . {gap}\nProject Manager:So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um . Uh . The {disfmarker} So I will ask you to do some work . Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and\nIndustrial Designer:Which i which is Hamed , {gap} ?\nProject Manager:read about {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:He's the Industrial Designer ? No , you're the Industrial Designer .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I am the Technical Designer ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno which one , uh v .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Industry and {disfmarker} Oh .\nMarketing:I think that's the first . I_D_ . Industrial Designer .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:And the second one is the User Interface Designer .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:User Interf Okay .\nMarketing:And then last one's marketing , which is me .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so I'm the first one .\nProject Manager:So , um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:For the User Interface Designer , which is Hamed um ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:uh , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:I see .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:And for the Marketing uh Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob , uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control . Um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} Sign .\nProject Manager:Yep finished . So I see you in thirty minutes .\nMarketing:Great , okay .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay , thanks .\nMarketing:Thanks guys . Bye .\nUser Interface:Bye .\nProject Manager:Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Uh . {gap}\n",
        "summary": "Project manager asked team members to present themselves. After that, project manager announced that the goal of the project was to design a new, trendy and user-friendly remote control, which would be sold all over the world. Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit would be around fifty million Euro. Then team members were asked to get used to the whiteboard by writing down their favourite animals. Besides, they were also asked to share their ideas and good or bad experiences about remote controls. From their point of view, remote controls with too many buttons or without backlight are hard to use. A potential-meter for volume control was also necessary. Remote control working with radio waves was better than that working with infra-red rays. At the end of the meeting, project manager had assigned tasks to team members.",

        "conversations": "Gareth Rogers:Good morning, and welcome to today's meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. Unfortunately, the Chair is unable to attend today, so in accordance with Standing Order 17.22 I call for nominations for a temporary Chair for the duration of today's meeting.\nJulie Morgan AM:I nominate John Griffiths.\nGareth Rogers:Thank you.\nDarren Millar AM:I'll second that nomination.\nGareth Rogers:As there's only one nomination, I declare that John Griffiths has been appointed as temporary Chair. Thank you, John.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. Thank you all very much, and item 1 on our agenda today is introductions, apologies, substitutions and declarations of interest. We've received apologies from Hefin David and Lynne Neagle. There are no substitutions. Are there any declarations of interest? No. We will move on then to item 2, and our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. Welcome to you both. Thanks for coming along to give evidence today. If it's okay with you, we'll move straight to questions, and Julie Morgan.\nJulie Morgan AM:Good morning. Bore da. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far.\nDr David Blaney:Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. That's part of the reason.\nJohn Griffiths AM:We certainly do not expect you to enter the political fray in any way.\nDr David Blaney:Thank you. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about \u00a35 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. That has an impact in a number of ways. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that\u2014that's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money\u2014we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful\u2014but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. I think that depends on the deal and how it all unfolds over the next several years. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen.\u00a0We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on\u00a0this and preparing for it. So, in terms of recruitment, Bethan.\nBethan Owen:This is based on the UCAS\u00a0applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June.\u00a0The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8\u00a0per cent, which contrasts with a 2\u00a0per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU\u2014so international students, not from Europe\u2014have also decreased by 9\u00a0per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7\u00a0per cent increase in England. So, those are the signs of changes.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. Could I then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment?\nBethan Owen:The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime,\u00a0are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. We have announced our funding allocations for 2018-19. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level\u2014\u00a312.5 million less\u2014then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report.\u00a0But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Diamond report was addressing. The other pressures relate to student recruitment. I mentioned the EU and international students. There is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. Enrolments are obviously the key important number, which we'll see later. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review.\nJohn Griffiths AM:In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be?\nBethan Owen:They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the UCAS\u00a0data. Institutions also recruit directly, so until we see the actual recruitment\u2014. I think the arrangements that have changed from 2018-19 also impact on EU students. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as\u00a0Welsh students. So, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. First of all Llyr, then Mark.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Well, that's straight into what I was going to ask, really, about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, where we see a 2 per cent increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this?\nDr David Blaney:It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have\u00a0an effect of perturbation.\u00a0That's probably relatively temporary\u2014let's hope it is\u2014as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the\u00a0Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. So, getting the messages out is a challenge. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and\u00a0particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. Certainly, anecdotally I know, from my own family, that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on. There's something rational about that, isn't there? If you've got a system that is relatively better invested, then you're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better. So, that's not irrational. We saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in, and some institutions, mostly in England\u2014there was one in Wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low, relative to that \u00a39,000, and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind.\u00a0So, the price sensitivities work quite differently. So, again, if you've got a relatively better invested part of the system, then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:That latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort, not just the international recruitment, of course.\nDr David Blaney:Indeed. Yes, indeed. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. And Mark.\nMark Reckless AM:If I heard you correctly earlier, you said that the applications from non-EU students were also down by 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So, forgive me a certain scepticism\u00a0about the explanation of the fall in the EU students being that they did get the fee grant and now they do not. If that's the explanation, why are we seeing the same fall in non-EU applications?\nDr David Blaney:Well, I think the Welsh domiciled are also now having to face the prospect of finding a loan for the whole of the fee. So, that would potentially account for that. There's also a demographic dimension here with the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile, and that actually is happening in Wales at a slightly later point than in England.\nMark Reckless AM:But this is non-EU students, and I think you said, Bethan, an 8 per cent or 9 per cent fall in them as well.\nDr David Blaney:International non-EU. I beg your pardon. I misunderstood.\nBethan Owen:There's also a mix effect. I gave a number that was for all English institutions that there will be differential impacts on.\nMark Reckless AM:All English or all Welsh?\nBethan Owen:Well, I contrasted the Welsh position with the English position where they were seeing growth. If you look, then\u2014and we don't have the detailed information, but, again, what UCAS publish is some analysis by tariff. They analyse by type of institution\u2014in other words, the grades that you need to get into institutions\u2014and there is a trend for growth being in the higher tariff institutions. So, there's a mix effect in there as well, and I think there's undoubtedly an element of perception of how welcome overseas and international students are, and that's something that we know the sector are working on with Government.\nMark Reckless AM:Why would that affect Wales\u00a0more than England? Do you think there's been perhaps too great a negativity about Brexit in the sector?\nBethan Owen:I think it's the mix of institutions that we have. So, we only have sector information published at the moment. When we look at the mix of institutions that we have, we will probably see a differential impact between Cardiff University and others.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay, Mark? Sorry, David, did you want to add anything?\nDr David Blaney:I was just going to say that we would expect to see quite differential performance in the English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type of institution you have in Wales.\nMark Reckless AM:So, performance is increasing amongst the English universities, but not amongst the Welsh, you think.\nDr David Blaney:I think performance is increasing, but increasing substantially with some of the English sector, not all of it. So, you get an average for the sector that is increased performance, but actually the stronger players within that sector, with the stronger international profiles, are bringing that up, and we have fewer in Wales that have that sort of presence.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. Darren.\nDarren Millar AM:Would it be fair to say, then, that the universities over the border in England are better at selling themselves internationally than our Welsh institutions? Or is it just this fact that we've got fewer very high tariff universities versus the English market?\nDr David Blaney:I suspect, and this is speculation\u2014I suspect that it's a bit of both. I think some of it is to do with the mix of different types of institution. I would then come back to the point I was making about the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. If you're looking overseas, I think Wales has to work harder to penetrate the consciousness.\nDarren Millar AM:But, forgive me, don't international students just look at the UK as a whole? How are we comparing to Scotland, for example, or Northern Ireland, in terms of their universities? Do you have a comparative figure for Scottish universities?\nBethan Owen:I haven't got that one with me for now, but there will be one in the data.\nDr David Blaney:Yes, we could get that.\nBethan Owen:Again, it's a combination of being part of the UK but differentiating, and the ability to differentiate the strengths of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw.\nDr David Blaney:So, in terms of the efforts that have been made, there's a programme now that is being run by the sector in Wales\u2014it's 'Study in Wales'. It's relatively recent; you could argue that we could have got there earlier. But that is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, with particular messages about what distinguishes studying in Wales from studying more broadly in the UK. In a sense, that is responding to the need to increase the presence of Wales in an international market. So, that sort of initiative I think is very good, very welcome. It will take a while to actually have an impact, but I think that's exactly the sort of work the sector need to be doing more of.\nMark Reckless AM:What are those messages on why prospective students should study in Wales?\nDr David Blaney:One of them in particular is relative safety. We know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. That's partly a function of the size of our larger cities\u2014quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in England. So, that's a key message. Being part of a UK system is also an important message there as well. So, we've got a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive, I think is the messaging that's coming through.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. We'd better move on, I think, hadn't we? Darren, then.\nDarren Millar AM:I just wonder to what extent you have been able to plan in your financial forecasts for the next few years ahead for the potential impacts of Brexit. What have you built in, if anything?\nBethan Owen:In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial forecasts, and we use those for monitoring sustainability. So, the last full forecasts that we had were in July 2017. We are due to receive a full forecast at the end of this month, and we obviously have updated information from institutions.\nDarren Millar AM:And they're three-year forecasts that come through to you, aren't they?\nBethan Owen:They are four plus the current year.\u00a0So, we've got numbers to 2019-20 at the moment, and expect to go to 2020-21.\nDarren Millar AM:And what are the universities expecting? What do they anticipate?\nBethan Owen:Well, for 2017-18, which is the year we're about to end now, they were expecting \u00a338 million income from European students, and approximately \u00a391 million from the various European programme funding sources, and that's about 8 per cent of the total income\u2014\u00a31.5 billion\u2014of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit that institutions\u00a0have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on, and, as I mentioned earlier, the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and\u00a0resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment, or where the sector is at the moment. And there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions, and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past. The sector made an operating deficit, again looking at all Welsh institutions collectively last year, 2016-17, of \u00a317 million. That's before other gains and losses. And we're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year, if not slightly higher. Now, these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the\u00a0sector. However, the increase in funding from Diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. Short-term challenges can be met if there's a reasonable prospect of future funding. You can manage in the short-term, but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and\u00a0infrastructure reductions have to be made. And, again, having mentioned the pressures on pay, pensions and other challenges, it is difficult to gauge whether, if those factors come into play as well, some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace\u2014either Diamond\u00a0funding or the European replacement funding.\nDarren Millar AM:So, would it be fair to say that, in terms of the funding arrangements, and, in terms of the student numbers, one reason why we've got this recruitment\u00a0problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've\u00a0seen in recent years because of the\u00a0financing arrangements from the Welsh Government, and the fee regime that we had previously, and\u00a0the student finance regime that we had previously, not getting more cash into our Welsh universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game and be more competitive, yes?\nBethan Owen:Yes, that would be fair to say.\nDarren Millar AM:So, to what extent are they planning for more capital investment\u00a0in those financial strategies that they've been preparing and presenting to you?\nBethan Owen:They are all planning for capital investment. They are in different positions in terms of capacity\u00a0to borrow and the assumptions. This year, 2018-19, is the first time that we've had capital funding in our remit letter\u2014so, we've got \u00a310 million of capital funding, which is very welcome, with a prospect of a further \u00a320 million. So, that we will be allocating shortly. That will make a difference, particularly\u00a0to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions. Some of our larger institutions have borrowed\u2014Cardiff University issued a bond. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and\u00a0expectations of what that money will be invested in. But they all have plans to do it and they\u00a0need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then, and service the costs of those borrowers.\nDarren Millar AM:So, the Diamond dividend you've mentioned a few times. What clarity is there from the Welsh Government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the Diamond dividend will be, and what proportion of that\u00a0is going to be released to HEIs in the future?\nBethan Owen:I was very carefully not describing it as a dividend\u2014a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding. The timescales are difficult, because we have an annual remit letter, and we can work with Welsh Government officials, and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released. But 2018-19 is\u00a0the start of the system, and because of cohort protection\u2014so, protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19\u2014in the early years there is an element of double cost; there's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system. So, at the moment, we're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we've allocated for 2018-19, with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year\u2014so, by definition, we've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding, albeit that's not approved yet in the budgetary process.\nDarren Millar AM:But you're not being given a steer at all as to what you expect the additional resource that you might have to make available to Welsh universities might be as a result of Diamond. You must have some idea.\nDr David Blaney:I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough. So, I think they're being very helpful; as Bethan said, they're constrained by the process\u2014they can't pre-empt a budget process. And you folks will be fully aware of that, of course. The other question I think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education. At the moment, we are expecting all of it to come into higher education, as the product of the arrangement between the current Cabinet Secretary and the current First Minister. The extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something I can't judge at the moment. But we have had in our remit letter from the Cabinet Secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years, as the Diamond process unfolds.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. I'm just going to bring in Llyr at this stage.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Bethan said in an earlier answer that, I think, the financial forecasting from universities forecast something pretty consistent in terms of what they're hoping to be\u00a0receiving in income, for example. But we've already discussed the near 10 per cent drop, potentially, in international applications. So, does that tally, really, or are they going to be recruiting additional students from the UK market or\u2014? What's the plan?\nBethan Owen:I was\u00a0reflecting on the last point when we had consistent information across the sector.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Okay. So, they may need to revisit that in the light of this.\nBethan Owen:I'm expecting that the forecast that we get at the end of this month will reflect the reduced applications we've seen, and an element of that will be reflected in reduced improvements\u00a0as well.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Okay. So, we don't really know, then, whether\u2014it's unlikely that they are going to expect a consistent fee income, really.\nDr David Blaney:I think it's fair to say we would expect them to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process. Even if they didn't, they would all, in any case, have sensitivities for what they would do if things don't come out in the way they hope. And if they didn't have that then we would be on their case, of course, because we want them to be properly sighted.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Okay. Thanks.\nJohn Griffiths AM:And we have to stick to the Brexit impact. Darren.\nDarren Millar AM:Can I just ask, in terms of the impact of Brexit, have you done any assessment of what you think might happen, or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so what scenarios have you set out?\nDr David Blaney:There's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, which is chaired by one of the Government directors, and we sit on that. And we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. We have, as part of that working group, explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the Welsh Government to try to put in place or for the Welsh Government to persuade UK Government to do.\u00a0And I think, in our submission,\u00a0we identified\u00a0a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action, and that has been worked through that working group. We know that it has informed Welsh Government's position, in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with\u00a0Her Majesty's Government. Beyond that, what we haven't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would\u00a0respond to different scenarios. We are not able to do that here either because, inevitably, they would have varying\u00a0degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very, very carefully. You take cost out, which is essentially the response, you actually take people's\u00a0jobs out, and all of that\u00a0has to be managed carefully. So, that's not really a matter for public consideration, but we do know\u00a0that the institutions\u00a0are looking at a range of scenarios on what they\u00a0would do. Bethan mentioned earlier\u00a0on that the\u00a0current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit\u2014it's not something that has taken\u00a0them by surprise. They are responding to what they\u00a0see as the dip between where Diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing. Similarly, I think we're comfortable\u00a0that there is a managed approach\u00a0to the scenarios that they're testing within institutions. So, they will do what they need to do to sustain themselves. The bigger issue really, in a public policy context, is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for Wales in terms of research and skills development\u00a0and all the other contributions.\nDarren Millar AM:So, you're confident that they're taking a robust approach\u00a0to planning\u00a0for various scenarios, going forward, are you, as individual HEIs?\nDr David Blaney:Yes, and as the deal becomes more clear politically, then they will obviously have greater\u00a0clarity in terms of which of these scenarios\u00a0they need to work up more fully, but they are sighted on it.\nDarren Millar AM:Okay. Can I just ask about fee and access plans, and how Brexit might impact them? To what extent\u00a0do you think that they\u00a0could be impacted?\nDr David Blaney:I think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there. Fee and access plans are approved annually by us. They are approved in advance of the recruitment cycle for the year that they apply to. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. So, there's quite a long lead time. We, as part of that process, go through similar\u2014we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts\u2014data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And\u00a0also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. In terms of process, we have two things that we can do. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan. So, we have a change process. If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later\u2014. We also monitor after the event and, if there are differences, we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences. If they've had fewer students and less investment, we would need to understand that. Conversely, if they'd had more students, and potentially more investment, we'd want to know what they'd spent it on, and if they've done different things, we'd want to understand that as well. So, we do challenge through a monitoring process. The only other thing that's perhaps worth saying is that, in the 2019-20 fee and access plans\u2014they're not published yet, so I can't give you the full detail\u2014five universities have made reference to Brexit and the Brexit impact, and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues, so they're in there as well.\nDarren Millar AM:But we've already said, haven't we, that it may be nothing to do with Brexit, this dip in EU recruitment, because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in? But they're making assumptions that it's linked to Brexit, are they?\nDr David Blaney:Not really. I think\u00a0they're making assumptions\u00a0that it could be. There are things they want to do to enhance and to protect\u00a0student mobility, and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment. So, the Brexit conversation between the EU and the UK Government might or might not sustain\u00a0Erasmus engagement, and if it doesn't, then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing. So, that's what we're beginning to see in the fee plans. It's them thinking about how else we can do this stuff.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay, Darren? Mark.\nMark Reckless AM:You mentioned the fee and access report. What else do you do to assure yourselves that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning\u00a0for Brexit?\nBethan Owen:We've touched on contingency plans, but, in an environment\u00a0of uncertainty, I think it's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is. I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure\u2014students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure\u00a0for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions\u00a0are doing. We mentioned the Welsh Government's HE Brexit group. That group, which is the Welsh Government\u00a0group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government\u00a0as well.\nMark Reckless AM:Do universities seek your advice on what the risks and, indeed, opportunities of Brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them, or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do?\nBethan Owen:They are autonomous institutions and ultimately\u00a0their governing bodies are responsible\u00a0for ensuring their sustainability. It's not a relationship\u00a0where we would advise and direct, but it is a relationship\u00a0where we would question the scenarios if we consider from our experience that we would have expected other scenarios to have been tested. It's that nature of conversation, rather than directing.\nMark Reckless AM:I understand you don't direct, of course, but my question was about advising. You're overseeing, or monitoring\u2014or whatever you like to describe the role as\u2014quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that.\nBethan Owen:I think we can advise\u2014we can advise based on data and information that we can see. We can advise based on our judgment. The big thing in this whole\u00a0Brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue.\nDr David Blaney:I think that's right. So, there's a relationship\u00a0with the sector and there's a relationship with individual institutions, and they are different. So, we have engagement collectively with the sector. Bethan meets with the finance directors, and I meet with the vice-chancellors. We actually\u00a0have the sector\u00a0and the funding council together on the Welsh Government's group. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance\u00a0activity, we will challenge. We have an annual cycle, with two points in the year where we reassess the overall risks of individual\u00a0institutions, and that's based on a whole range of hard data but also a range of soft data. Our links into institutions\u00a0are many and varied. We have lots of conversations and we take all of that in the round and form an assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions but also the extent to which we think their governance and management arrangements are properly sighted and facing properly the challenges that they face. In some ways, we say it's not about the challenges they face; it's about how they face the challenges. Our alarm bells really ring when we get the sense that, actually, either an executive or a governing body hasn't really noticed. We're\u00a0not in that place, I'm really pleased to say. I'm not worried about short-term crisis with any of the institutions. There are medium-term real challenges, both because of Brexit and because of other contextual factors, but at the moment the sector is a managed sector, which is good. It's not always like that, but we're in, I think, a good place at the moment. So, our role is definitely to challenge where we don't think they are making sensible assessments, but it's not to say that their assessment is wrong and ours is right; it's just to have a conversation\u00a0about, 'Why have you done this and what has informed your thinking?' It's slightly more one step back and slightly more subtle, but it is, as you imply, us using the intelligence we gain from all of those conversations when we talk to individual institutions as well.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. Llyr.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Yes, thank you. We had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions, including Cardiff University, and it's very interesting, in relation to Erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that, I think, only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in Cardiff is paid for by Erasmus+. I note that you've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator. I was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments\u00a0to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that.\nBethan Owen:Again, reflecting on the latest fee and access plans, seven of the universities are referring to mobility\u2014either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are\u2014so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan\u2014if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure wasn't available, to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly. And to enable an infrastructure that allowed\u2014. Ideally, you'd want something that all Welsh institutions could take part in, and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating. And, equally, you need to have the arrangements with your overseas and European institutions. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing Erasmus. So, I think replacing it would be a challenge.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:And the point was made clearly last week that the brand is internationally recognised. When you enter into Erasmus+, you know exactly what you're going to get, and all of that. But there have been criticisms as well about degrees of flexibility and this, that and the other, so I'm just wondering whether\u2014and there is presumably going to be some change on that front although I'm hoping we can buy into it, as others have done who aren't in the EU\u2014that emphasis on encouraging institutions to look more proactively at funding their own mobility efforts would be positive.\nDr David Blaney:I think the\u2014\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Sorry\u2014especially if it means that they do more of it.\nDr David Blaney:Indeed. I think the Welsh sector is definitely committed to trying to find ways of promoting and resourcing that sort of mobility. There are signs that some of the restrictive elements of the Erasmus programme are going to change anyway, because that's under development and that's positive. There have been positive noises as part of the Brexit negotiations about wanting to carry on being able to access the Erasmus programme. Nothing is agreed until it's all agreed apparently, so we'll have to see on that one. That would be far better, I think, as Bethan indicates, than trying to replace it with a made-in-Wales only, but you could have a made-in-Wales on top. All of these challenges also create opportunities because they stimulate thinking, and so the fact that seven of the eight universities\u00a0are already now using their fee plans as a vehicle for thinking about this is positive, and I think we can take that on from there.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Because that 40/60 split struck me as being the opposite to what I perceived\u00a0the situation to be. A key\u00a0part of your role is to work in partnership with students, so I'd just like to ask what work have you done with students, in terms of maybe protecting their interests as the Brexit scenario evolves?\nDr David Blaney:Well, as you say, we do work with students. We were the first of the funding councils\u00a0in the UK to have a memorandum\u00a0of understanding\u00a0with the National Union of Students in Wales. We work very closely\u00a0with them and the president\u00a0of NUS is an observer on our council. So, we have close links with NUS Wales and we're very proud of that, and it's very productive. They don't have a vote, but they do have a voice and it really matters. We we're, again, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. The UK-wide quality code also has elements in it where arrangements have to be specified about the protection of student interests. That is particularly, in essence, around circumstances where a provider gets into difficulties and they might wish to close a course or something more drastic and then what arrangements are in place to make sure that those students who are in train are protected. So, that is there and we've worked hard with the sector and with NUS Wales to get those measures in place. There's more development work in train at the moment, so we've asked Universities Wales to construct a protection that takes account of the approach to protecting the student\u00a0interests in higher education. We're also requiring\u00a0further education institutions\u00a0who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important. The students who are HE students in FE are absolutely not second-best, and they should have the same protections.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:But is all this a general piece of work? It's not Brexit-specific, although, no doubt, it may\u2014.\nDr David Blaney:I think that's fair to say, yes. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and that's, kind of, beyond our pay scale\u2014that's a UK Government issue.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Is that something that you have a view on?\nDr David Blaney:It's clearly in the interest of the enrichment of the curriculum\u00a0and the student experience for students in Welsh institutions to be able to have students from other EU countries\u00a0in the mix. So, it would be nice to find ways of continuing to facilitate that.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Okay. Now, of course, you have a statutory duty as well to assess the academic quality of the work in our higher education institutions, and I'm\u00a0just wondering\u00a0what potential impacts you think that Brexit might have on that particular aspect.\nDr David Blaney:I think there are possibly\u00a0a couple of things to say, and one, in a sense, echoes what I was just saying in the final part of my previous response, which is that part of the quality of the student experience\u00a0is the richness that you get from having students in your cohort who have different backgrounds and different perspectives. So, if there is a continuing\u00a0reduction in the number of EU students coming into Welsh institutions, then that richness deteriorates. That doesn't\u00a0mean to say that the base or the threshold standard of what's required for a degree will come under pressure, it's just about the richness on top\u00a0of that, which will be, in a sense, a quality-enhancement issue. That would be something that we would wish to try to protect against, but in the end you can't force EU students to come\u2014you have to try and look attractive, and we've touched on that. The baseline requirement assessment\u00a0of quality will not be affected by Brexit, except in so far as the machinery we use to discharge\u00a0our statutory responsibility, which is through the Quality Assurance Agency, which themselves\u00a0are accredited\u00a0with\u00a0European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, the European machinery\u00a0for higher education quality. And there's a set of standards around that, and we would obviously wish not to be in a position where our ability to use and adhere to those standards is adversely\u00a0impacted upon. Those\u00a0standards will still exist, and it will be possible for the British system to adhere to them, even if they're not actually able to play in the same way. Then the only other thing I would\u00a0say is that one of the factors that can cause\u00a0the quality of the learning and teaching experience to be likely to become inadequate is when institutions come under financial pressure, just because their capacity to maintain the same sort of student experience can get under pressure. So, clearly, we will be looking for and making sure that institutions manage the financial pressures, if there are any\u2014and there are some at the moment, as we've described\u2014and manage those carefully. And in all of that, we will expect institutions to do their duty to make sure that the commitments they've already made to students are carried through. So, where students have already started on the course, they need to be able to finish that course\u2014you can't just pull the plug out. So, all of that comes into the arrangements for quality as well. So, we'll be keeping an eye on that.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Okay. A lot of what you've told us in the last three quarters of an hour or so will have costs attached, depending on the impacts. Certainly, we're in choppy waters as a sector anyway, and the risk is that things will be even more choppy, if you'll excuse that level of political interpretation, over the years to come. I'm just wondering what advice you might have given the Welsh Government in terms of what level of transition funding, or Brexit transition funding, might be required by the sector, and if you have, what the Welsh Government might have told you.\nBethan Owen:I mentioned earlier that, obviously, we've provided information in terms of the assumptions that the sector are making on income. So, for the year 2017-18, that was \u00a3129 million. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding depends absolutely on what the final arrangements for Brexit are, but it's an appropriate point to refer to the report that Professor Graeme\u00a0Reid has produced, commissioned by Welsh Government. That was, and has, provided advice and recommendations for supporting research and innovation in the transition period. But, again, the Reid recommendations in that report build on the Diamond recommendations, and as soon as\u00a0Diamond is in place\u2014and Reid is providing recommendations in addition, to establish funding on the basis that the funding needs to be available in Wales to maintain and develop and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure that we have.\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:Are you not worried, though, that the clock is ticking and that we really don't know what the situation is at this point?\nDr David Blaney:Do you mean the Brexit situation?\nLlyr Gruffydd AM:The Brexit clock, yes.\nDr David Blaney:Uncertainty is unhelpful, because as I've said several times, the sector is a managed sector at the moment. I don't think there's\u2014. We're not seeing maverick stuff, but actually you can only manage, really, what you can see and what you can reasonably predict. So, the longer the uncertainty persists, the more difficult that is for institutional management and, indeed, for the rest of the machinery to support them. So, yes, the sooner we get clarity, the better for everybody, I imagine.\nDarren Millar AM:Chair, can I just ask a question?\nJohn Griffiths AM:Yes, Darren.\nDarren Millar AM:In terms of uncertainty, though, we've still got this uncertainty over whether the extra cash that the Government's going to have to spend as a result of Diamond being implemented is coming to the HE sector. They've given a political commitment, but you've got absolutely no other assurance of the sums of money that are coming in. We've got the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales, which are also under way, so it's a bit of a perfect storm for you, isn't it, really, with all of these three things happening at the same time?\nDr David Blaney:We're certainly kept busy.\nDarren Millar AM:But two of those things are in the gift of the Welsh Government to sort out for you, aren't they?\nDr David Blaney:Well, the policy on the reform of the post-compulsory sector absolutely is a Welsh Government policy. The extent to which they can pre-empt a budgetary process and give us clear sight of the amount of money in future years is\u2014. Well, again, it's not for me to comment. My understanding is that that's difficult for them to do, and I would repeat what I said earlier: officials have been as helpful as I think they can be in respect of that. I mean, you're right, we've only got a political commitment between two people currently in post. It would be great to have that firmer. I'm not sure how that could be done.\nDarren Millar AM:I mean, that statement about the savings accrued from Diamond being reinvested wholly into the HE sector has not been repeated, frankly, has it, since the coalition deal was struck?\nDr David Blaney:No, but it hasn't been rescinded either, so\u2014.\nDarren Millar AM:No, but there have been opportunities\u2014repeated opportunities\u2014in the Chamber, where the Cabinet Secretary's been asked to repeat that commitment, and the First Minister's\u00a0been asked to repeat that commitment and has not given that commitment. That must concern you, and must concern your university sector even more than, perhaps, some of the elements of Brexit that we're discussing.\nDr David Blaney:Bethan has outlined earlier on in this session the fact that institutions are currently running deficit budgets in order not to lose the infrastructure on the assumption that the Diamond money will come in. If anything were to cause significant perturbation, either to the timeline of that or to it coming in at all, then there would be much more of what Medwin Hughes calls 'houskeeping' that would be required, and that would be significant. So, at the moment\u2014I don't like the expression 'valley of death', but there is a valley to cross, and I think the sector is reasonably confident about how wide and how deep that valley is. There's a demographic valley as well. So, there are several valleys that they're crossing\u2014the metaphor fails, doesn't it, really, but I think you get the drift? So, there are a number of challenges and they can see their way out of some of those challenges, but if any one of these starts to get significantly disrupted, then that would be a real issue for them.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. Could I go on to ask about other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils? What would you say those barriers are?\nDr David Blaney:Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one\u2014and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful\u2014is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit\u00a0in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. I mean, STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM\u2014it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. If you look at the impact on public policy that could come from social science research\u2014tremendous. And we're very good at it in Wales. The Welsh impact in its research is better than anywhere else in the UK, so that's good. So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further\u2014so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. So, that's, kind of, straightforward. There are other things. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils, making sure they're in the various committees and so on. We are intending to do a bit of work to see if we can systematise that a bit better\u2014that engagement\u2014because there's no doubt about it: it's not to say that this system is in any way inappropriate, but the more you're in the conversations, the more likely you are to be better placed to respond to the research challenges that come up.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. One final question: in terms of the researcher collaborations and networks that exist, do you see potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of those, and are there any particular lessons to learn from\u00a0S\u00ear Cymru II?\nDr David Blaney:I think that there are two things to say here as well. First of all, the Brexit deal might or might not impact adversely\u00a0on the capacity of Welsh and, indeed, UK research infrastructure to play into broader collaborative activity across Europe, and, in a sense, that's a function of the deal whatever the deal looks like, and we'll have to wait and see. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. It's not just the money, it's being in the club and it's the signalling that we're in the game. So, all of that would be important. And then the other part of my response to this would be that, actually, Wales will need to continue to be good at the research it does, so maintaining the quality, maintaining the impact, and hopefully growing\u00a0the critical mass. The S\u00ear Cymru initiative has been quite important in doing that, because it's been very focused, capturing key research players, and the attractiveness that that has then to other researchers around them, and to industry collaboration, and they have been areas of real strength that we've invested in. And I think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. Just one further point, from Darren.\nDarren Millar AM:Just very briefly, one of the pieces of feedback that the committee members received at a stakeholder engagement event, which took place prior to this inquiry starting, to receive oral evidence, was about the research funding that is available from the charitable sector, and how poorly Wales does in attracting some of that research. I think we had some figures from the British Heart Foundation, which said they have \u00a3100 million a year available for research grants, or something like that, and we're getting 1 per cent of that coming into Wales, which is\u00a0obviously pretty low down. I appreciate that research into the type of activity that they want to put their money into, Wales may not be\u00a0particularly good at, and there may be other opportunities with other charities and partnerships. What work are you doing in order to build the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales?\nBethan Owen:One of the issues is the capacity to engage with that funding,\u00a0because of the overhead issue that David mentioned. Charitable funding at the moment doesn't attract any overhead funding. Again, that could be built in to our funding, if we had the capacity to increase our quality-related research funding. There is an element in England.\nDarren Millar AM:But that pressure's the same in other parts of the UK, is it not? So the overhead funding is still an issue in England, and in other places.\nBethan Owen:There is an increased contribution, and I think it's an element that was increased this year to acknowledge that. But there will be differentiation between different charities. I'm fairly certain that some of our institutions will be very strong with the cancer charities, possibly not the heart foundation. And some of that will reflect on focusing on our strengths, but to have that fuller picture.\nDarren Millar AM:So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every \u00a31 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another \u00a34 on top, because that \u00a31 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash\u2014.\nDr David Blaney:That's exactly it. So, the more you're able to invest\u2014. You know, we sometimes get into a conversation about the unhypothecated nature of our research funding, but actually that creates a\u00a0flexibility and the infrastructure investment that allows institutions to be able to respond to these other opportunities. Without that, they can't do it, because if you're not careful, you've got\u00a0institutions engaging in UK-wide or charity-based research activities where they're actually having to pay for it themselves\u2014they're running at a loss.\nDarren Millar AM:So that's the main problem; it's not that Welsh universities aren't doing their best to get this cash in. Or is it a bit of both?\nDr David Blaney:I think, in the main, universities and researchers will get their cash from wherever they can, so I don't think it's a lack of appetite.\nDarren Millar AM:Okay.\nJohn Griffiths AM:Okay. Well, thank you, both, for coming in to give evidence to the committee this morning.\u00a0You will be sent a draft of the transcript, to check for accuracy. Diolch yn fawr. Okay then, the next item is item 3, papers to note, the first of which is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education\u00a0on the school organisation code. The second is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Chair of the Finance Committee regarding scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget\u00a0for the forthcoming financial year, which we will be discussing under item 6 on the agenda. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on parental attitudes towards managing young children's behaviour. And\u00a0the final paper to note, paper to note 5, is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care\u00a0on the children and family delivery grant, which we will discuss later on in private session, if Members are content. Okay. Are you content to note those papers on that basis? Okay. Thanks very much. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting, and also for items 1 and 2 of the 20 September meeting. Is the committee content? Yes. Thank you very much. We will move then into private session.\n",

It's not that complicated , but I get it wrong every time . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew {gap} .\nMarketing:For Matthew , yep .\nProject Manager:Mm . Uh {disfmarker} So I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:he's uh obviously late for some reason . {vocalsound} Good . Um . Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design . I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh {gap} . Uh I will take some minutes uh again .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members ,\nMarketing:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented . So and that uh will uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So um who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ?\nMarketing:I have a presentation , I'm just making this {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah the {disfmarker} Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here\nProject Manager:Okay . Ah\nIndustrial Designer:because it's really a a team uh project with a team\nProject Manager:there is Matthew .\nIndustrial Designer:and if someone is not here then we cannot {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:but it's okay {vocalsound} it's good . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay I'll just email you this file , my presentation .\nProject Manager:So . Good . Do {gap} presentation ready ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm I'm just emailing it to you .\nProject Manager:Oh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So did you manage uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah I sent you the slides , you didn't see them ?\nProject Manager:Oh yes I see him , good yes .\nUser Interface:Okay . {gap} .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing:Okay it should've gone through to you .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay mm yes I have it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . Um can I just put this on ? So we have to work out a way {disfmarker} what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . Um . This is {disfmarker} to do this I will not remove my microphone . {vocalsound} We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and as part of this {disfmarker} The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . The most important by far was the look and feel of it . It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out {vocalsound} . It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . People will wanna buy it . Um {disfmarker} That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative {disfmarker} has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . People have to then think about it and say {gap} got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to {disfmarker} be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Um I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . That would make it stand out . Um .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ?\nProject Manager:Spongy feel ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh about the feeling yeah uh yo\nMarketing:Well\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} You can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those {disfmarker} a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um . Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's another way of doing that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe {disfmarker} to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . They're big selling items . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't {disfmarker} I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . I think we're better doing something basic like this\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:which is very important and very {disfmarker} will be a really cool feature to put in . And {disfmarker} {gap} use . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves ,\nProject Manager:Mm . Yes well\nMarketing:and then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:yeah\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{disfmarker} and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Yep {vocalsound} and that's the presentation .\nUser Interface:Voila .\nProject Manager:Okay good , that's very clear .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah very clear .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Um . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? I think you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Maybe we yes well we maybe {vocalsound} can decide later on um {vocalsound} the l the the look and feel of uh I've {disfmarker} it was a good idea maybe to to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:To let the people choose , {gap} you mean ?\nProject Manager:Yes the the the there are changeable covers ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because {vocalsound} you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well we're selling so many units of this . This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .\nProject Manager:Hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects .\nMarketing:Mm mm .\nProject Manager:Yes . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Sure that fits the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes {gap} and of course it will be a we we get a {disfmarker} if it works we can get uh after-sales\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I mean that would {gap} would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:That's a very good idea um {disfmarker} And then uh maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because\nUser Interface:Yeah\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:s\nProject Manager:the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:then we could discuss later like {disfmarker} we can put all ideas together .\nProject Manager:Together indeed uh ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:It should be easier with that .\nProject Manager:because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah I agree .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , yeah .\nProject Manager:what you were already mentioning .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And your part is very related to mine\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside .\nUser Interface:Yeah so {vocalsound} I'll I'll go with that actually\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Okay so m so {vocalsound} then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So what I have found was that uh currently uh the {gap} they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:and uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like {disfmarker} You can basically {disfmarker} if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the {gap} T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Mm . Mm . I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . That's a good idea .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:even if you arrange it by {disfmarker} however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Hmm . Mm . Yeah I really like that idea .\nIndustrial Designer:So what functionalities do you suggest for that ? For facing this problem ?\nUser Interface:So it it it's like it {gap} limited one . In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for {vocalsound} eighty word thing , eighty word ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:you want to st store your favourite channel .\nMarketing:Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most .\nUser Interface:Yeah some ten twelve channel information . You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are {vocalsound} having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is {gap} now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Oh yeah yeah yeah mm .\nUser Interface:to model the functionalities will increase actually ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:and for you and you might want {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:you don't want separate keys for all of them . You can't . And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I personally would look at {vocalsound} things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having {gap} unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm b\nUser Interface:and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word\nMarketing:Mm . Mm .\nUser Interface:and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:which is again {disfmarker} and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you're uh {disfmarker} it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And you want okay {disfmarker} for coming back to one point\nMarketing:Two thirty five supposed to finish .\nIndustrial Designer:y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ?\nUser Interface:Yeah you can let them to do that .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh isn't that too difficult for the {disfmarker} we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:that's the {gap} compromise .\nUser Interface:N no but the {disfmarker} if you give {disfmarker} it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Mm . I think you can do it both ways .\nUser Interface:So it de\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:You can have it so it's easy {gap} they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it ,\nIndustrial Designer:A standard .\nMarketing:or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um yes but but I do {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:maybe you can {vocalsound} give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:I'm sorry to have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Every time I have to come down on this price again\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:to {vocalsound} so this might be a little limiting for your creativity ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:but it's it's it's the real {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We have to consider it . S so {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:do we think these ideas {vocalsound} an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh {vocalsound} uh case of the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm yeah like {vocalsound} I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but for the A_S_R_ system , uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this\nUser Interface:We well we can still look at {disfmarker} we can talk with the coffee unit\nIndustrial Designer:We {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and you can uh check how much how much they {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented ,\nUser Interface:yeah yeah\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip .\nUser Interface:Maybe we can come {vocalsound} we we can talk to them , and we can come with that ,\nProject Manager:Mm mm .\nUser Interface:you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And also well you can think of having uh since you have a {disfmarker} you know something {gap} maybe if you added little bit of {gap} display , you might need the {disfmarker} to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some {vocalsound} kind of indicator ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:it could actually be used to detect also .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also .\nMarketing:Mm . Hmm .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something .\nUser Interface:No actually {vocalsound} i if i it is like {disfmarker} you know it tells you um , it can be for two purposes ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote ,\nMarketing:Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface:which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it {disfmarker} and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something\nIndustrial Designer:It's true .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:and it can change the colour depending on your uh {disfmarker} how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:You know .\nProject Manager:'Kay good .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm yes um I would {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You you have time some more ? Yep .\nProject Manager:Yes yes you can you can still . We have time .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Sure you can you know {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So the method is {disfmarker} ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like {gap} , and uh what cost {disfmarker} the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . So there are two uh different types of uh um {disfmarker} Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control .\nProject Manager:Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an {gap} that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board {gap} buttons , infrared {vocalsound} , led , etcetera , for the components um . So you {gap} finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um . So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . And uh so I think {vocalsound} for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology ,\nUser Interface:Yeah mm mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to {gap} them and connect them .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So my personal design {vocalsound} we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . If it's plastic\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well well\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm just have a yeah {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah like they do in with cars I think . Yeah inside the car\nMarketing:Just the veneer on it , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . So they also emailed me that uh they have {vocalsound} available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a {gap} computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . And the final point okay is um we have {disfmarker} yeah there are some uh compromise to to do .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but {vocalsound} I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So to {vocalsound} to sum up um we need {vocalsound} yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert\nUser Interface:Sorry .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:so that we can {disfmarker} it's really a team-working uh . So\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I I cannot design something without your agreement ,\nProject Manager:No of course .\nUser Interface:Yeah so\nIndustrial Designer:right ?\nUser Interface:of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:or if you want to store a programmes with a keys {disfmarker} What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside {disfmarker} W wh what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it's kind of um simple {gap} pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert .\nUser Interface:W what {disfmarker} Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions\nUser Interface:Okay so\nIndustrial Designer:of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the {gap} card .\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly yeah , for customizing and yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually . How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah good idea .\nProject Manager:So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features .\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly yeah that's a very good idea ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and\nProject Manager:So\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:D well {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you think that's feasible ?\nUser Interface:Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} You th you think it's possible .\nUser Interface:Is it possible to fit in to that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah also thinking , I think both uh {disfmarker} if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay ,\nUser Interface:Sorry .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but uh {disfmarker} {gap} .\nMarketing:Well maybe we need specific costings then . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .\nProject Manager:Mm yes\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's an excellent idea .\nProject Manager:wh when you make a {vocalsound} a design ca you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah . Yeah\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:That w that would be a very good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:because right now I don't have {gap} price in in head\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that .\nProject Manager:Good good .\nUser Interface:Yeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . For example if f if you want to put wood {disfmarker} I wouldn't suggest for wood\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:uh {gap} 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber {gap} rather than wood .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . I agree on that . Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah\nProject Manager:which which come with a with another price .\nUser Interface:it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is {gap} but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is {disfmarker} it's much better with that rather than going for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do do you agree ?\nMarketing:Mm yeah sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh {vocalsound} graphs or I don't know uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that .\nProject Manager:Ma I I think uh for next meeting we c {vocalsound} you two can present a real design . Uh so drawing it on the board .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yea\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Perfect yeah .\nProject Manager:And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . So um {disfmarker} Let let's say next meeting w {vocalsound} you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah sure . Yeah we will uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:But that that that that can be done later .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah customized .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um .\nUser Interface:Okay {vocalsound} {gap} . We can give them smooth keys , you know . Smooth keys with bigger s uh {disfmarker} So that you know {disfmarker} The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and every time we have to be very {disfmarker} but if i the {disfmarker} if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together\nMarketing:So is there any of these that you're looking at particularly\nUser Interface:to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:or is this just ideas ?\nUser Interface:Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and uh {vocalsound} now you can , for example , as I was {gap} if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people .\nMarketing:Hmm . Mm . Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:At the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all {gap} problem .\nMarketing:Mm yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think .\nUser Interface:Uh big keys may better {gap} for them actually and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You see ?\nIndustrial Designer:I agree yeah ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and not too m too many keys of course yeah .\nMarketing:Mm well\nProject Manager:No no .\nMarketing:one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys .\nProject Manager:Mm mm mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't {gap} use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:which you don't use . So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah . Um yeah I've seen that before too . Anoth another like b\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yes . Yeah so it's something like this , the model here\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:s {gap} you can put the keys {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well .\nIndustrial Designer:That's what you mean ?\nProject Manager:Yes I I th that's what I mean\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:so I mean something like like a book .\nMarketing:I like this one . I like the shape of this one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Can we have {disfmarker} can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I like also this one .\nMarketing:that's a {disfmarker} maybe curved or something .\nUser Interface:Yeah , mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should {vocalsound} dec decide numbers or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm mm 'kay . Is this for the next meeting though ?\nUser Interface:We should make a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah that {disfmarker} yeah next meeting we should be {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ju just make two designs ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah that would depend upon us actually .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:and the we we can decide decide between th those designs .\nMarketing:Yep .\nUser Interface:Yeah okay .\nProject Manager:I think that would be a good idea . So\nIndustrial Designer:Perfect .\nProject Manager:anyone uh any questions for now ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No no . I don't have .\nMarketing:No . So is this {disfmarker} is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ?\nProject Manager:Um yes I come to that uh uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that .\nProject Manager:Yes well m maybe uh , I don't know whether that's possible ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow .\nMarketing:Okay well is this {vocalsound} me designing a way to evaluate it so {disfmarker} Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:but a as far as possible .\nMarketing:Okay . Yep .\nProject Manager:So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email .\nIndustrial Designer:Two or three prototypes ?\nUser Interface:Two .\nProject Manager:Two .\nUser Interface:One for like cost and the one with like higher-end\nIndustrial Designer:Two ?\nProject Manager:I {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm {gap} and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:so that then we can be easily comparing them\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:or you know find a compromise between both of them ,\nIndustrial Designer:and find maybe a compromise .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Yes okay .\nUser Interface:yeah that's how it is .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Perfect yeah .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay let's call this to an end .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Thanks guys .\nIndustrial Designer:Thanks .\nUser Interface:So we are done for now . {gap} .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting was mainly about conceptual design. First, the marketing gave some opinions about product requirements based on market surveys and the group discussed some specific ways to fulfill them. After that, the user interface designer proposed to make a universal controller with speech recognition and a blinking thing. A list of basic components were also given. When it came to the cost control, the group believed that they should do some compromise to keep the cost under 12.5 Euros and the specific design scheme would be decided at the next meeting.",

So welcome back . {vocalsound} At the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . I will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . {vocalsound} Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um {vocalsound} uh I had an email from the from the management board\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:uh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important . First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . {vocalsound} Uh second one is also important uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , so uh that's one thing to keep in mind .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh {disfmarker} would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . Uh and uh I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , we have uh forty minutes , so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh {disfmarker} whatever you want . So uh Tim , can you start ? Yeah ?\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} 'Kay , welcome . I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:which I will show you . {vocalsound} The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . Um {vocalsound} one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . Um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . Um , we have three audiences of {disfmarker} two audiences , {vocalsound} I'm sorry . Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five {gap} age . Uh the second one is from sixty four {disfmarker} uh forty six to sixty five . Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent {disfmarker} um sixty five . Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . Mm {vocalsound} and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . I don't think that's uh really appropriate . Um , {vocalsound} and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh {disfmarker} Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . Second findings {vocalsound} out of the questionnaire um are the opinion {vocalsound} the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer . Okay , third findings . According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um {vocalsound} following buttons are most important . Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . Um , {vocalsound} persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . Um , when you multiply them , you get the {disfmarker} these three points . Switching channels , um yeah , that's pretty uh pretty normal , that's what you do with a remote control . Um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want {disfmarker} wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear .\nProject Manager:But it's strange that the the manage board {disfmarker} the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . So that that's strange .\nMarketing:Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay , but uh at the moment uh teletext is {disfmarker} Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay . Yeah .\nMarketing:So uh , when you ask people , what do they use , {vocalsound} they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:That's ridiculous . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:That's a ne i it {disfmarker} It's a new technology ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:but it's not incorporated right now . Okay , my personal preferences . Um , I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . {vocalsound} Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . Um , yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . Um {vocalsound} second point , {vocalsound} we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . Third point um that came out of the uh {disfmarker} of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's a cool idea .\nMarketing:where you can put the the remote control in . {vocalsound} Um , that's about it , I think . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about ?\nMarketing:Uh not not the r not the functions ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh , the funtionability .\nMarketing:but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , yeah it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah okay , so focusing more on the used buttons .\nMarketing:Yeah , they have to be on it\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:j just to t to get it done if necessary ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example .\nMarketing:Yeah , perhaps .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nMarketing:Just for the minor functions perhaps .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , ma perhaps , just just an idea .\nMarketing:Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah ? 'Kay , that's it .\nProject Manager:Thank you , Tim . {vocalsound} Janus , can you uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure . Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . Um right . Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh {gap} a cheap uh remote . Well uh as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth {disfmarker} Well it may be possible , but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in {disfmarker} within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . F because uh {disfmarker} well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth {gap} or or radio waves , {vocalsound} although {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , actually I have t\nMarketing:So it's in the wrong product .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , I actually {disfmarker} I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh {disfmarker} the infrared function . So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost {gap} that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore . Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . Uh first you have the energy source . The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use {disfmarker} you could just go out and buy a new one . So we didn't {disfmarker} and we don't have to do all uh {disfmarker} to be too complicated about that . Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch {disfmarker} there is a switch uh between these . When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh {disfmarker} immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_ , so is is something wrong or something . So that's just to uh to to explain the {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} to to uh make it clearer to the user . Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . Uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh {disfmarker} well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use {disfmarker} you don't use them , so why why should we invent uh {disfmarker} w spend more time on those . Uh I I think we should stick by {disfmarker} with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . So uh no input from the television . So I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such . So I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um , yeah , maybe another problem uh , I think current T_V_s can even send infrared .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , but what should we uh s I I I f I agree with you , but should we spend money or {disfmarker} and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ?\nMarketing:Huh .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause that would be {disfmarker} I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So I I {disfmarker} my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . Um , well\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:we should uh look into the design and the functionability . Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh {gap} stuff . And uh don't overbuild , we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . So that was my uh my personal opinion . And that was my uh my presentation uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , thank you Janus .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yes ,\nProject Manager:You do ?\nUser Interface:I can go ahead .\nProject Manager:The last presentation . You have plenty of time ,\nUser Interface:Last presentation . Okay .\nProject Manager:Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so uh take your time .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:warn you .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well , I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh {disfmarker} if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's that's some of the main points . And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . Um well , of course I I hope this is all clear to you . If you {disfmarker} you can use remote like this with all the functions , {gap} many functions , but {disfmarker} Well , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . You have to be very careful what you push ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um {disfmarker} yeah well , where is it ? Where the hell {disfmarker} he here I guess and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . For example if you want to use a play and back and stop , that's very important . Um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it's no longer uh applying . {vocalsound} Well yeah , I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and um n uh not to give too many options and and if possible , uh the buttons should give {vocalsound} a dr direct action , not first select {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , so uh\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:you you want to keep it simple ,\nUser Interface:and so that's where the difficulties lie .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one .\nUser Interface:Yeah , this {disfmarker} so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface:or do we want to use um many buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So um weighing those factors .\nMarketing:Hmm {gap} it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ {vocalsound} or a touch screen um , that in the middle are the the main keys , like displayed on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh yeah .\nUser Interface:The {gap} doesn't {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {gap} . Yeah , this ? No ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Something like that . Okay , just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or {disfmarker} that you can drop down .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but when all the questions I had {disfmarker} Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle {disfmarker} button , um display the menu on the T_V_\nMarketing:Nah . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:is too complicated for most users .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think so too , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that will be a problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Well\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you d you have to {gap} keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not {disfmarker} our remote won't be able to work on all televisions .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:And that would be uh a considerable problem .\nUser Interface:So if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Use big clear buttons . Not too many . So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important . Um {vocalsound} especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen .\nIndustrial Designer:Not embed Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could {disfmarker} could make more menu up {disfmarker} pop up or something .\nUser Interface:And yeah , if you want to uh uh s put {gap} on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . Not first change menu options or switch something .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um , well yeah , as you already told , give some feedback . If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple . So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function {gap} on the the television , some you you'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it's uh important\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important {disfmarker} um well you {disfmarker} we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions .\nMarketing:Yeah . Uh , I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um and that's a big ad advantage I think , because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:It's uh very visual intended . {vocalsound} What was I to say more ?\nUser Interface:Maybe that's an option . Um keep the primary buttons visible . Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah okay , but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?\nIndustrial Designer:The extra functions .\nUser Interface:The extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,\nMarketing:Yeah , but l like menu functions or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and then all all the options will become available\nMarketing:Ah okay .\nUser Interface:and you just c s yeah t scroll through them .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet\nMarketing:Yeah , I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh I'll just make um {disfmarker} uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with {disfmarker} or sub-items , sub-functions .\nUser Interface:Well um\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:then I'd like to make a proposal .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:If you make one big touch screen ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yes .\nUser Interface:use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:like like the iPod idea that that we just saw .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several {disfmarker} you can also improve uh later on .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh uh I think that will be great .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .\nMarketing:Yeah , I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I wou I would actually go for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Jirun ?\nUser Interface:Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , of course .\nUser Interface:And so um an elder designer picks up th the {disfmarker} of\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:like building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:but children uh {disfmarker} if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah wh Is that possible to use or no ?\nIndustrial Designer:That is possible , that {disfmarker} well that actually depends on the television ,\nMarketing:Th there's just {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , yeah well ,\nIndustrial Designer:but I think {disfmarker} I figure that would be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:does it have to depend on the television ?\nMarketing:Ju just a simple log-in , something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Well ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , the the channels are different on each te television ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:they aren't set in a preset order ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so uh if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well , I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh {disfmarker} make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh {disfmarker} change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , th that kind of stuff , but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , that's uh vi violent channel ,\nUser Interface:Oh , something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:uh m my ki my kids uh {disfmarker} I don't want my kids to watch that ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:then you set the priority to only parents ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well b but make it a separate option in the menu ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that would b\nMarketing:for example . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , that .\nUser Interface:so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh {disfmarker} displayed here ,\nMarketing:Yeah okay , but but {disfmarker} yeah , that's just\nUser Interface:so uh parents uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:that's an a an added feature .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay . But let's not uh go too wide about the {disfmarker} those things , that's that why we're here .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , {vocalsound} th th those things are nice . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel {vocalsound} later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p\nMarketing:Partial .\nProject Manager:yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:uh and uh {vocalsound} the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible .\nMarketing:Yeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers\nUser Interface:Yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style .\nMarketing:that's just as e just as easy .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . I I do {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You can display actual buttons on the touch screens .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I do agree ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:or when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience .\nMarketing:Yeah , it's different .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:W we are aiming for younger people\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's true , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and they they chose {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , age b below forty .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's that's probably uh a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true .\nMarketing:so {disfmarker} A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I th I think we can do that too .\nProject Manager:Mm {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay , as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh {vocalsound} are done .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Done . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh I've uh added the {disfmarker} this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . Uh so that can be uh can be read out . Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um {disfmarker} Moment . Ooh . Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh {disfmarker} we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't {disfmarker} uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh {disfmarker} um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically {vocalsound} each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the {disfmarker} done by the remote control and not by the television . I think that's the point what uh\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:we discussed .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , some of them . The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Well you can use um {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ ,\nMarketing:Yeah , but that's not possible .\nUser Interface:then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , mm yeah .\nUser Interface:and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from {disfmarker} ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} capable from the t\nProject Manager:Yeah , but you have uh uh an {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Add th that that's an opportunity {gap} .\nProject Manager:yeah , but you have an international market range , so you have I think a big range of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well there are universal d um um remotes\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But they {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And it's not too complex to do it .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and that that is bit of a tricky job .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I actually use one of those when {disfmarker} They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh um mo\nIndustrial Designer:and that's well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No no no .\nUser Interface:no , you can just say uh the c\nMarketing:{vocalsound} He he he he me he means just just one other thing .\nProject Manager:Just build it in .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press {disfmarker} yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yes .\nUser Interface:In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . You look up , I have a Philips H_ fifty five\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and it says press code four five five\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:and you press code four five five on the {disfmarker} uh in the remote\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:and it displays all your uh menu options .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in {disfmarker} just just in the memory ,\nUser Interface:Memory in the in the remote .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Profiles .\nMarketing:so that if you {disfmarker} yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:the memory uh pops up the options .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , that would be possible . Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:I th don't think that's uh {disfmarker} that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .\nIndustrial Designer:No , that wouldn't be uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , well um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , a few variables .\nUser Interface:if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so uh I think uh it is possible {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah it is . It is definitely po\nMarketing:But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We have five minutes to go .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well then you have to buy a new one , it's very good for marketing\nMarketing:New remote ?\nUser Interface:Maybe , or an update , software update .\nMarketing:A firmware upgrade or something ,\nUser Interface:Firmware update , you say .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , firmware upgrade .\nMarketing:but from where ? Ah . Maybe w\nIndustrial Designer:That's maybe the cup holder .\nMarketing:No m may no ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home . Well the most most people have ,\nUser Interface:Well , at {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but not not everybody\nUser Interface:uh you can go back to the shop\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:and uh they {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:like a s kind of service centre .\nUser Interface:Yeah , ser o\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe something like service cen\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and they can download it for you .\nIndustrial Designer:Or you could {disfmarker} well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T_V_ uh connections ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they {disfmarker} we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh {disfmarker} well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in ,\nUser Interface:Receiving . Oh yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:we could actually look at {disfmarker} into it ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs {gap} uh with with it\nUser Interface:Difficult . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah , uh s I think some {disfmarker} I think it's good idea , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that would be probably best , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask {disfmarker} well I'll {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's it's it's not a lot of work , just one uh docking station where you put it in ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:press start , bling bling , updated .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that would be best , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so .\nUser Interface:Okay , let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No no . Exactly , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um m for which one are we going ? {gap} My mistake .\nMarketing:Let's vote .\nUser Interface:That one or uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , my vote goes out to the right {gap} .\nUser Interface:Your vote and your {disfmarker}\nMarketing:My vote too .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And your vote ?\nUser Interface:Well , I was uh doubting about which one to take , but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open .\nUser Interface:Opens up is too difficult\nIndustrial Designer:Flips open .\nUser Interface:or uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh too difficult , um maybe uh it's easier to break it .\nProject Manager:N yeah .\nUser Interface:Break it , I don't get {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , th th th that i uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's very sensitive .\nUser Interface:Oh so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Like my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay well uh it's almost at the end . So we have now a lunch break , finally ,\nMarketing:Ah .\nProject Manager:yeah . {vocalsound} Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes . Uh I will put my minutes {disfmarker} uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too .\nMarketing:Thirty minutes ?\nProject Manager:Thirty minutes , the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:How minutes ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Failure . Uh {vocalsound} uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will {disfmarker} all will receive uh at the uh the the email . I don't think I can uh say much about it , so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes , and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .\nMarketing:One question ,\nProject Manager:Yeah ?\nMarketing:uh how late do we have to get back {disfmarker} be back here ?\nProject Manager:Uh well uh thirty minutes .\nUser Interface:A quarter to one maybe ?\nProject Manager:Uh , yeah .\nMarketing:Thirty minutes lunch break ?\nProject Manager:Thirty minutes lunch break , yeah . Oh . Forty five ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:I thought forty five .\nProject Manager:Uh then would it be uh one o'clock .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Or we we ask our personal coach . Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Thank you . Thank you , uh that was a very uh good session I think ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:we uh we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , is it possible to store this on the share documents or what {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , me too .\nProject Manager:Uh ye well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Save as .\nProject Manager:Yeah , because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh X_D_K_\nMarketing:Yeah , v\nProject Manager:and that's in {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But but you can open a {disfmarker} from your pr from your laptop .\nUser Interface:'Kay , save it as an image on the res\nMarketing:Yeah , maybe . Save as .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Export . Maybe not export function .\nMarketing:No . Export .\nProject Manager:Well I can I can uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Export H_T_M_L_ .\nUser Interface:No , and use an image if possible .\nMarketing:Huh , image ?\nUser Interface:J_ PEG .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} G_ {disfmarker} yeah , J_ PEG .\nUser Interface:J_ PEG . Yeah , it's better\nMarketing:Paper size A_ four . Uh screen size . In this directory .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:N oh .\nUser Interface:Oh yeah , it's not connected to the\nProject Manager:You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work .\nUser Interface:to our P_C_s .\nMarketing:No ? Yeah , it is connected .\nUser Interface:It's connected ?\nMarketing:Yeah , I think so .\nProject Manager:Deskt Huh . No .\nIndustrial Designer:To room .

        "summary": "Project Manager firstly gave some main points of the design of remote control. The Internet would be the main focus and the proposal of multi-purpose remote control was clearly rejected. Besides, the customer group expanded to those younger than 40. Then group members respectively gave presentations about the conception of the functions of remote control. Based on a questionnaire, Marketing concluded that the remote control should be simple, the buttons bigger and for minor functions. Industrial Designer rejected the idea of using Bluetooth and indicated that infrared would be better and within the budget. Industrial Designer believed that remote control should be simple and suggested sticking to basic things of remote control. User Interface also agreed to keep it simple and put forward the idea of using a touch screen and being user-friendly. Finally, Project Manager led the team to further discuss detailed questions like menus, parental control, update service.",

So um . So that was the opening .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . My name's Poppy . I'm the Industrial Designer for this project .

But um um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , Which brings us to our next subject ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:is , um , um ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So this is a television remote control ?\nProject Manager:Yes , it's a television remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right . I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . So , alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um , yeah . Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design . So , um , making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um {disfmarker} and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . Um , tool training . Is , is everyone , um {disfmarker} {gap} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Got those notes .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Great . Great .\nMarketing:Thank you .\nProject Manager:Um One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} With our microphones still attached to our bodies . Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Gosh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay , what's my favourite animal ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do come up . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} to go first . {vocalsound} Oh ,\nProject Manager:This is a team-building time\nIndustrial Designer:are we all doing it individually ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:where , um , {vocalsound} ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , let's stand up and support you {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay cool , um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:right now it is an elk .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:An elk ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:alright , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} A vicious {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And it goes like {disfmarker} Yeah it's got like big antlers ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:yeah . Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Do you have elk where you come from ?\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:You do .\nProject Manager:Yeah\nMarketing:We have moose too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we have moose and we have deer .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do you have {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We have sheep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} 'Kay , um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sheep . Yeah ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:cows .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That's a great elk .\nMarketing:Uh-oh , we have a good artist . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That is really good .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Thanks .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'm quite {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This is my {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh , very shapely .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Brilliant .\nProject Manager:That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that um , that um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Very nice . Okay .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Not as artistic as Heather's drawing .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Bit more cartoon style .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and {vocalsound} they just know what they're doing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Basically , that's why I like cats . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Very good . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Great .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} I'll rub that out . There you go . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure {vocalsound} how to draw one .\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh .\nUser Interface:I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes {vocalsound} and they're really easy to draw .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um ,\nProject Manager:I forget her name .\nUser Interface:right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog .\nMarketing:Tara\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:or Tara .\nIndustrial Designer:Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's a cartoon dog I think .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . {vocalsound} It's a scary cartoon dog . That {disfmarker} This ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:that does not look like a dog .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It looks kinda like a person . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We can pretend . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'm sorry .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's Pinocchio .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's a dog . {vocalsound} . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's true .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I've nothing against cats . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} that don't look like that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Alrighty . I feel like a robot .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . At first I thought it was a dead leaf .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda {disfmarker} there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this .\nProject Manager:It's kinda like a peacock .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was {disfmarker} This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Very nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:There you go .\nProject Manager:Great .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh , what do we {disfmarker} Oh .\nProject Manager:Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?\nMarketing:Yes I do . {vocalsound} {gap}\nProject Manager:Yea {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um {disfmarker} or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um {gap} selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can {disfmarker} like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents .\nMarketing:Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty .\nProject Manager:I'm bad at math .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:'Kay . {vocalsound} Um ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so now that , um , that is underway , um\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . Does anyone have any initial thoughts ?\nMarketing:I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's always , where is the remote control ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking {vocalsound} device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , {gap} signal ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'cause it always gets lost .\nUser Interface:Do yous not find that , um , {vocalsound} like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that you don't use half of them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I don't know what they do . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's , that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's useful .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it is . Yeah .\nMarketing:So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Alright . Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Any ideas will do that you have at this point .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Could be shaped like a conch ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Can hold it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} A novelty .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:you know . Be like a shell-shaped remote . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . Like , I've seen phones like a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So , hmm .\nProject Manager:And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover {disfmarker} We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for .\nIndustrial Designer:Industrial Designer .\nMarketing:Interface ?\nProject Manager:Industrial Designer .\nIndustrial Designer:That's me . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh , industrial .\nProject Manager:I have to remember these things . Um . You'll be beginning your , your working design .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , {vocalsound} maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert .\nMarketing:Marketing Expert . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nUser Interface:{gap}\n",
        "summary": "This was the first meeting on the team's project. It started with every member introducing themselves, getting to know each other's names as well as their individual roles in the project. Project Manager then revealed the overall plan for their project, announcing that they were going to design a new television remote that would be both trendy and user-friendly. After that, each person drew their favourite animals on the whiteboard and shared their reasons for the choice, with Project Manager choosing an elk, Industrial Designer a cat, User Interface a dog, and Marketing a butterfly. Project Manager then added some financial details to their plan, setting their selling price and cost. In the following brainstorming time, they raised ideas on night-time operation, a tracking device, and the design for buttons and shape. Finally, Project Manager arranged tasks for each team member to take on until their next meeting.",

Um let's get started . 'Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . We're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . And we have forty minutes again . 'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . Okay . Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . Who would like to go first ?\nIndustrial Designer:Just trying to move mine right now .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ?\nMarketing:Yeah {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay . Trend watching ? 'Kay .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay , so trend watching . Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . So what they want . Right now customers want fancy versus functional . Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they {disfmarker} like of the product that they want , describing like the {disfmarker} in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . So the customer basically is confused . They don't know exactly what they want . They want us to tell them . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:They want everything , but simply .\nMarketing:Yes . Exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:So we can go to next .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:Okay . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to\nProject Manager:Mm . Mm .\nMarketing:rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . I mean do you guys know what I mean .\nProject Manager:Right . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah th\nMarketing:Yeah . Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months ,\nProject Manager:Right . People don't buy a new remote every so often .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I I can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:because {disfmarker} Yeah . I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now .\nIndustrial Designer:I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation .\nMarketing:Okay . Awesome .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . Actually right here . So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . So it's classically retro .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it .\nProject Manager:Very good . I like it . {vocalsound} Okay , ready for the next slide ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And , yep . And that's it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Op mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Great . Great presentation . Ready ?\nUser Interface:Okay hang on .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:See if it's there . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Which one is it ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I don't know . Hang on .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Interface concepts , no ?\nProject Manager:Interface concepts new .\nUser Interface:Either refresh it , or it sh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Y\nUser Interface:Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . Hang on .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mine will always read copy of something or other .\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I I copied mine before I sent it over .\nProject Manager:Oh okay .\nUser Interface:Sorry , hang on . Don't know {gap} .\nProject Manager:Oh there we go .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Okay , um {vocalsound} looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . Uh if you wanna start the next slide .\nProject Manager:Sure .\nUser Interface:Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . And then also there's the idea of the base . That's sort of like an idea there . And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . It's becoming really {gap} and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both {gap} kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like {vocalsound} using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but {disfmarker} Anyway , next .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . Um but then you have {disfmarker} you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay . Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . Um this is particularly geared towards children .\nMarketing:That's cute .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Um it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain {disfmarker} {vocalsound} channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:uh keep them away from other channels . So that's like another ar Um ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . You have the wider section for the main controls there . Uh you could see how many buttons there are . And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ {vocalsound} function which we are not gonna be using . Um . So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this .\nProject Manager:Mm . Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:I have four of those remotes .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Good lord .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Ready ? Oh , yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface:That's it .\nProject Manager:Great job .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , my turn .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Whoo .\nProject Manager:What's the title ?\nIndustrial Designer:It'll be copy of component design .\nProject Manager:Got it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Th that looks like it . 'Kay . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . So that being said {disfmarker} Next slide , please . Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . Next slide , please . Thank you . Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . {vocalsound} Next slide , please . Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So next slide , please .\nProject Manager:Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer:Suggested casing options . Okay . We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That would be amazing , though , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:No , splinters would {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um certain restrictions do apply here though . Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . Double-curved , you can't do titanium .\nMarketing:What is that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you {disfmarker} the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . And uh so you {gap} functions what {disfmarker} for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:I think I have one more slide .\nProject Manager:No , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:No , I didn't . Um the manufacturing division also has said that um {vocalsound} they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . Alright ,\nIndustrial Designer:And that's all I got .\nProject Manager:well thank you for those informative presentations . Let's go back to um {disfmarker} Now we have to make some decisions . Where were we ?\nUser Interface:Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before ,\nProject Manager:Sure .\nUser Interface:and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . Um .\nMarketing:Oh this {disfmarker} the thing we were talking about earlier .\nUser Interface:Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for {disfmarker} So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme {disfmarker} do we program the responses and the questions . So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this .\nProject Manager:Right . Right .\nMarketing:Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options .\nUser Interface:Right ,\nMarketing:So that way the remote reads it .\nUser Interface:so it's got like a limited memory and {gap} programme it . So it's sort of iffy ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:but that's kind of what you'd say .\nMarketing:I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm . Programme .\nMarketing:I mean we could do it , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , we are making the chip .\nMarketing:Technology .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So , I mean {disfmarker} But , I guess , we have to look at w what {vocalsound} our production cost is for the chip itself anyway .\nMarketing:And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:the , I mean just like the more advanced it is ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:the better it'll sell .\nIndustrial Designer:I I thought {vocalsound} offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know {disfmarker} I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So that we could reduce cost .\nMarketing:Yeah , 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ?\nMarketing:Oh the base , yeah .\nProject Manager:The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think the p\nUser Interface:I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:'Cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ .\nMarketing:W\nProject Manager:It's not gonna be a huge universal remote .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want\nProject Manager:What size battery and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this ,\nMarketing:and exactly {disfmarker} It could be like this . Yes .\nUser Interface:'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .\nMarketing:I'd , well uh {disfmarker} This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever ,\nUser Interface:Are you gonna lose it easier ?\nMarketing:because {disfmarker} But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that .\nIndustrial Designer:That's true .\nMarketing:So we can make it small if we have a l locating device .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So i That's the other thing ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:it's like {disfmarker} You know {gap} Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size {vocalsound} period ?\nMarketing:Two double A_s , for this size .\nUser Interface:But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be {disfmarker} have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right . I agree , it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So we sh\nMarketing:Smaller , without {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:A battery like this guy .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? You wanna vote ?\nMarketing:I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced .\nProject Manager:I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I'm a away from the base .\nProject Manager:bigger and the base .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That just seems so clunky and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is ,\nUser Interface:Smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:yeah {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} You're kidding .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} You know it happens .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I've had three watches go that way too .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh watches I've {disfmarker} but I've never washed a cell phone . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ouch . A phone , whoa , that would {disfmarker} wow , that would hurt .\nProject Manager:Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ?\nIndustrial Designer:Pieces everywhere . Well , we have lots of options . I don't think wood is a viable option .\nMarketing:Yeah wood .\nProject Manager:No . Oh what did you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , titanium s\nProject Manager:Oh sorry , go ahead .\nUser Interface:I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then I would probably {vocalsound} lean away from that .\nMarketing:Yeah , 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:However ,\nProject Manager:What would you recommend ?\nIndustrial Designer:well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:right ? 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . That'll {disfmarker} Yeah , exactly .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:make them a rarity so to speak .\nUser Interface:The selling point , yeah .\nMarketing:We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Are we restricted by this ?\nProject Manager:I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm\nIndustrial Designer:Well the original {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Twenty five Euros\nProject Manager:not sure that we'll have the time and money to {vocalsound} produce a whole array of\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:remotes . If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Good plan .\nMarketing:Good plan .\nProject Manager:Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ?\nIndustrial Designer:Honestly I'd recommend like um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex ,\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so ,\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:because this year is all fruit , God only knows why ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , who knows .\nIndustrial Designer:um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ?\nMarketing:O or we could like take off this .\nProject Manager:They could buy cases , maybe ,\nIndustrial Designer:They could come back . And buy the extra case .\nProject Manager:if they wanted .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options .\nIndustrial Designer:So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could {vocalsound} give two latex covers to start .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The {disfmarker} what the top face , right ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . That's in . Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic .\nProject Manager:Right . Right . Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ?\nIndustrial Designer:How complicated {disfmarker} Are we gonna go with the voice activated {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . {gap} could we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:A tracker , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:'Cause that uh {disfmarker} what it type of , yeah , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing .\nMarketing:So uh {disfmarker} Ooh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's {disfmarker} it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech .\nUser Interface:Well , my little sister got {disfmarker} for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , see that would just irritate me .\nUser Interface:And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off .\nProject Manager:Oh dear .\nMarketing:Oh ,\nUser Interface:So it became highly irritating .\nMarketing:then maybe voice\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So I think having a key-phrase is much better .\nMarketing:maybe voice activation won't be good .\nProject Manager:Okay . Alright . But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ?\nMarketing:Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder .\nProject Manager:Just a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:But then it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , alright .\nUser Interface:Hmm . Okay .\nMarketing:But do {disfmarker} can your {disfmarker} can the department make {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That would be like a mid-class um {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:Oh , brilliant then .\nIndustrial Designer:So we don't actually have to go for {disfmarker} Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Why not introduce it in this way ?\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:Yeah , good point .\nProject Manager:Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ?\nMarketing:I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter .\nProject Manager:Two ? Could it run off of two {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean more more come in a package .\nUser Interface:Well , that depends on what the energy is needed .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? So they're more widely available now . And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries .\nProject Manager:They're more expensive though , too .\nIndustrial Designer:But if you only have to replace it every five years .\nProject Manager:Mm . Thoughts anybody ?\nMarketing:That's a good point .\nUser Interface:As long as we sell it with it .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it ,\nUser Interface:Right , that's what I meant .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk .\nMarketing:We could think about it and come back to it next meeting .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah . Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:We still have one more meeting .\nProject Manager:Okay . So we've covered that first category , User Interface Concept , meaning design .\nUser Interface:What's it gonna {disfmarker} Yeah , what's it gonna look like .\nProject Manager:Okay . I ki I kind of {vocalsound} like your idea about the retro phone dial ,\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:and that {disfmarker} the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? It might be the four way scroll , too . I mean if {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , it could be whatever ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Oh , that's true .\nUser Interface:because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?\nMarketing:Good point .\nIndustrial Designer:In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh , I see what you mean .\nIndustrial Designer:that could be particularly useful .\nProject Manager:I think so .\nMarketing:So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I like that . 'Kay .\nMarketing:But we definitely {disfmarker} If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Well , if it's just up and down {disfmarker}\nMarketing:like on the side of it . Oh if it's just up and down .\nUser Interface:But is that for {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Volume or channel .\nUser Interface:Which ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I don't know .\nMarketing:Well , you could do some on both sides .\nUser Interface:Do we have both sides ?\nProject Manager:Can we ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah . We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then ,\nProject Manager:So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause oth {vocalsound} otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know .\nMarketing:That's squishy . That's squishy .\nUser Interface:Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .\nMarketing:{gap} have buttons .\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , {gap} that .\nProject Manager:Hmm . 'Kay any other ideas ?\nUser Interface:Um what colour ?\nProject Manager:Oh , yeah . Latex covers . W\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available .\nUser Interface:Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . And that's at the bottom of it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers ,\nUser Interface:Which button ?\nProject Manager:I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some {disfmarker} the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? Every cover ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea .\nProject Manager:If we want it to be visible and {disfmarker} Um are all those {disfmarker} those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? But those are plastic , right ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:They're not titanium .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I kind of like that look . Uh but , or if it was really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:For our base one ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:What are your thoughts ?\nMarketing:or like a gun-metal grey ,\nProject Manager:Gun-metal gray .\nMarketing:'cause then it combines the silver and the black .\nProject Manager:There you go , gun-metal gray .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .\nProject Manager:Why ?\nIndustrial Designer:It'll wear off . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What's the button {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , buttons wear off .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Well , w w then what's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ? I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:On the back ?\nUser Interface:But you don't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But we want it to be seen .\nProject Manager:It d visible {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But uh , yeah , you don't see it .\nProject Manager:Visibility though {disfmarker}\nMarketing:We need it to be seen .\nProject Manager:'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery .\nUser Interface:Well , hang on . The other option is {vocalsound} , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I can find it again .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's like the second to last slide .\nProject Manager:Okay . And yours was called Interface Concept ?\nUser Interface:Interface , yeah .\nProject Manager:This one ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . Um .\nProject Manager:Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay , it's the very right one . You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top .\nProject Manager:Mm\nUser Interface:And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in .\nProject Manager:Okay , yes\nUser Interface:If c you envisioning it ?\nProject Manager:yes .\nUser Interface:And so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so {gap} it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons ,\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Like a little cut-out kind of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:That's like , you know , {gap} a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ?\nMarketing:Some of tho Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Well , kind of . Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow .\nUser Interface:Yellow .\nProject Manager:Yellow , I like that idea .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Like if we {vocalsound} like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons .\nUser Interface:Oh , that one .\nProject Manager:I like the yellow illumination idea , very good .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Any other ideas or thoughts ? We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um . Ha hang on {gap} {vocalsound} Let me catch up .\nMarketing:Mm yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we {gap} just everything that we said before ?\nProject Manager:I think there will be time for that later . I'm guessing . 'Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put {disfmarker} We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , right ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I guess . 'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Great . Play Doh .\nUser Interface:Fun . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . Alright . Well , thank you for a very productive meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Wonderful Ooh .\n",
        "summary": "This was the conceptual design meeting for the remote. The first presentation was given by Marketing on trend watching. Marketing pointed out that customers wanted the remote to be technologically innovative and yet simple to use, and that the current fashion trend was fruits and vegetable patterns. Clearly labelled large buttons with the company logo and colour scheme were also preferred. User Interface followed with the presentation on interface concepts, proposing to have a scroll-down design and a distinctly recognizable demographic for specific buttons. Industrial Designer's presentation on component design provided information for the material needed for the remote, and certain restrictions coming with different options. After User Interface's additional thoughts on voice recognition, the team discussed designs of the energy source, the material, and the user interface concept, deciding on latex covers, the gun-metal grey colour, and blue and yellow touch buttons.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Alright ? Alright . Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . Um {vocalsound} the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . Um and people lose them . And {vocalsound} We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um {vocalsound} that we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . So again um , I'll {disfmarker} we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . Um {vocalsound} now the the the internal chip um {disfmarker} and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and given that {vocalsound} th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um {vocalsound} go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Kate . Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Um p there we go .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} 'Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at {disfmarker} uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . {vocalsound} Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip {disfmarker} the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh {disfmarker} which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels . {vocalsound} Um . Oh . {vocalsound} Uh cool . {vocalsound} Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . That's something we should think about . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . {vocalsound} Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be {disfmarker} allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . {vocalsound} And that pretty much sums it up .\nProject Manager:so how um {disfmarker} sorry , can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Oh yep , sorry . {vocalsound} Yep .\nProject Manager:Uh d d d {vocalsound} okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Do we do we know uh by how much ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound} Um I don't actually have any price information , no . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip .\nIndustrial Designer:Um it {disfmarker} a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . Oh w yeah , we did {disfmarker} the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed ,\nProject Manager:Right ,\nIndustrial Designer:it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form ,\nProject Manager:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:uh so it would uh {disfmarker} it's hard to predict the time . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ?\nUser Interface:I {disfmarker} I just have a question about that . Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um\nIndustrial Designer:W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick .\nUser Interface:and that w\nIndustrial Designer:Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world {disfmarker} the the sky is your limit ,\nUser Interface:Okay . Then it doesn't matter . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but to actually {disfmarker} the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Cause uh I {vocalsound} must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I d d for slightly different {disfmarker} well no , I mean , it's if you you {disfmarker} speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} this is the internal company information , is it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh bits of it , yeah .\nProject Manager:So uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , as well .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros .\nProject Manager:Yeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:uh decide .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's that's right . It's like {disfmarker} it's it's {disfmarker} you can't {disfmarker} 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:But we don't know . Um . {vocalsound} I mean uh I su i I mean if {disfmarker} given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um . Thoughts ?\nUser Interface:Well , another thought I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Would {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:oh , sorry , go ahead .\nMarketing:Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um {disfmarker} maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I mean I think we {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface:Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hm .\nUser Interface:{gap} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I I I I I think that's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:And we've been talking about it the whole time .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , mm .\nUser Interface:Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .\nProject Manager:Mm , right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Uh yeah , {gap} it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:From uh my presentation show , so .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it should be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh technologically innovative .\nProject Manager:Right , okay , so .\nIndustrial Designer:No ,\nProject Manager:Fine . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:that sounds good . Mm .\nProject Manager:I it will have voice recognition um uh\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Cool .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , {vocalsound} volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah .\nUser Interface:I think so .\nProject Manager:Right . Okay . Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? No ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh nope ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:that was it , that was it .\nProject Manager:Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Let's see .\nProject Manager:Mm . Oh good .\nUser Interface:Oh . Yes . Is it gonna work ?\nProject Manager:Mm yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's thinking about it .\nProject Manager:it'll get there . Yep .\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so I did some research on the internet and um {vocalsound} what {vocalsound} {disfmarker} you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . Um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual .\nProject Manager:Mm , yeah .\nUser Interface:There're some special ones available , like this one right here ,\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:which is marketed towards children , um different designs ,\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some {vocalsound} Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So just kind of minimise the clutter ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:avoid too many buttons and also um {vocalsound} one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm yeah . Sorry y y yeah , {vocalsound} if I can interrupt you . Well d {vocalsound} p 'kay , do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really . I I mean , I think it's just sort of {disfmarker} the the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} there's a lot of slide buttons out there . I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , fair enough , fine .\nUser Interface:Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down\nProject Manager:Yeah . Good , good .\nUser Interface:and then the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:this is my great little drawing .\nProject Manager:So three three {disfmarker} there's three buttons on a slider .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Three buttons , channel up channel up down and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Y yes , yes .\nMarketing:Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . Because if it {disfmarker} if you no\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of {disfmarker} if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:So you kinda take it up one at a time .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel .\nMarketing:D\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh .\nProject Manager:This one on the one side and one {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh you could you could {vocalsound} as l as like a mouse you could {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so it'd be kinda good to have them be {disfmarker} feel completely different . You'd know what you were fiddling with .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker} yeah uh th th the {disfmarker} I mean thi this is what the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That was {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a {disfmarker} uh volume and channel change\nUser Interface:Um well\nProject Manager:of one sort .\nUser Interface:I was thinking kind of just for the volume ,\nProject Manager:Just for the volume , uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:but what what do you guys think ?\nMarketing:Dep I dunno if it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We could {disfmarker}\nMarketing:depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , {gap} it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:and then you could control the buttons with your fingers .\nProject Manager:Fingers ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause if {disfmarker} yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the {disfmarker} that for rolling ,\nProject Manager:It {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it {disfmarker} the two are clearly different ,\nUser Interface:B\nIndustrial Designer:just the way it would {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah , yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two .\nMarketing:Oh yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:So okay . Right so uh\nUser Interface:I'm just gonna pass this along .\nProject Manager:that's {disfmarker} sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:okay , fine .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm right .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Here we go .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh yeah , this is my report on trend watching .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And uh the most important aspect is the l the look {disfmarker} it has to look fancy , look and feel\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:uh instead of the current functional look and feel . This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I I mean I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh exactly , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I s that out of sequence ? Uh yeah , sorry . Uh yeah , and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh .\nMarketing:Uh sorry , clothes , shoes and furniture\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:and uh a spongy material to be used on the {vocalsound} on the outside .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . But uh I was gonna say um yeah ,\nProject Manager:What ?\nMarketing:fruit and vegetables , uh important to {disfmarker} this year um important to furniture , I'm just gonna say uh {vocalsound} f like it's in {disfmarker} if if fashion {disfmarker} if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But fashions do don't last very long .\nIndustrial Designer:Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nMarketing:and then we can just whip that off and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights . You know , that kind of spongy {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , yeah , that weird {disfmarker} I dunno what that is ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:but yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:A kind of {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Also means you can drop it without damaging it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {vocalsound} , yeah , it's good as well . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's true .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} c cool . Um {vocalsound} you have {disfmarker} we could {disfmarker} if we could save {disfmarker} depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I I mean it its uh I {disfmarker} that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . Um that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Wh\nProject Manager:yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker} I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product .\nProject Manager:W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm .\nUser Interface:What if we included the batteries in the cover ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah . I like that .\nUser Interface:So um\nIndustrial Designer:That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers\nUser Interface:like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so can I see that thing ?\nProject Manager:S\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah ,\nUser Interface:Just {disfmarker} this as examples .\nProject Manager:I n I know {disfmarker} the only p I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it {disfmarker} y you've then got the connection\nUser Interface:So f\nProject Manager:and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah .\nProject Manager:and it it it {disfmarker} you know , total reliability ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I guess that's true .\nProject Manager:but I mean I d I I uh I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from .\nMarketing:Or {disfmarker} well , but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different {disfmarker} like you've only got like , you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and this is the microphone . And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . And then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh {disfmarker} even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , then having {disfmarker} getting cheaper production costs\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , you probably are right .\nProject Manager:um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh {disfmarker} a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't {disfmarker} it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's true .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I mean it is {disfmarker} it's up to it's up to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , just another five Euro to get {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager:Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly .\nProject Manager:{gap} that's that's right , yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , like they have for mobile phones\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly .\nUser Interface:that are just fruits and animal prints and colours .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So uh i so uh okay . {vocalsound} Um right ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:sorry . Um we hadn't finished your {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker} oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say uh {disfmarker} yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like uh {disfmarker} a part of the f like it it {disfmarker} the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ?\nProject Manager:It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um this is fashionable .\nMarketing:Yeah . This is fashionable\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . Um , so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh {disfmarker} I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:um w we need to decide on the {disfmarker} just the basic shape of the thing . And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you know , t to deliberately get away from the uh um {vocalsound} uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um mm or uh {disfmarker} 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a {disfmarker} you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it ,\nProject Manager:Yeah uh the the uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} or or b\nIndustrial Designer:but I'd {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:yellow seems a bit of a strong colour\nUser Interface:like an {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I'd I'd um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:to make the ent like the thing {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah . Uh no\nIndustrial Designer:no , but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour .\nProject Manager:I d I I agree , I mean we're we're we're simply {disfmarker} it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound} . Mm {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:And make that a fashion symbol as well . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well n\nProject Manager:Well , th this is {disfmarker} this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm {disfmarker} I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And uh then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um {vocalsound} a shape that's almost like a mouse .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:So that , you know , when they hold it it's {disfmarker} because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:have the power , wherever , somewhere .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean I've uh {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:I mean that was just an idea that I had .\nProject Manager:Oh no that {disfmarker} well there's the sim {disfmarker} my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , maybe .\nProject Manager:so that you can just sort of ho hold it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though\nUser Interface:Kind of a c\nIndustrial Designer:'cause it {disfmarker} a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip .\nProject Manager:W it {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse ,\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe it'd be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Sort of a combination .\nProject Manager:but held , you know , so it's {disfmarker} you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and fiddle around with it and press it .\nUser Interface:Yeah so {disfmarker} yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the {disfmarker} about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:and you can fiddle\nUser Interface:then wider up here .\nIndustrial Designer:an yeah .\nUser Interface:And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Mm .\nUser Interface:and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , cool .\nUser Interface:What do you guys think about that ?\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , that sounds {disfmarker} Um I'm just {disfmarker} I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much {disfmarker} how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's a very good point .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It is a very good point .\nProject Manager:I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . That um the {vocalsound} we n\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that uh {disfmarker} yeah {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice {gap} 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that\nProject Manager:Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it ,\nIndustrial Designer:and it's microphone-esque ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , and just say {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .\nProject Manager:I th I th honest uh {vocalsound} my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um .\nMarketing:Mm I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing .\nProject Manager:It's cer it's certainly possible I mean , but they {disfmarker} we we're going beyond w w\nIndustrial Designer:Bu Mm .\nProject Manager:given the state of the technology {vocalsound} we want something that we kno we know will will work um .\nMarketing:Hmm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . I mean {vocalsound} uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and {disfmarker} or do voice commands , and {vocalsound} either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness\nProject Manager:Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:and and sc\nMarketing:that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:and then you can you can minimise the buttons\nUser Interface:Yeah , I suppose I sup\nIndustrial Designer:and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:If we we're {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .\nUser Interface:So I guess we could have a menu button as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .\nProject Manager:Uh uh uh\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . Do we need some sort of display ?\nIndustrial Designer:But the television would be the display\nProject Manager:We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that {disfmarker} things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu\nUser Interface:Yeah , and then y\nIndustrial Designer:and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah .\nMarketing:Well I mean\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:on a {disfmarker} onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , that's true .\nUser Interface:Yeah , press that is t\nIndustrial Designer:I never understood how that worked though ,\nUser Interface:yeah , that might work .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's like um {disfmarker} yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . You just press it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and you could just click that to {disfmarker} so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , oka yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:You know what I mean ?\nMarketing:Uh yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm yeah . Okay , we got five minutes to go in this meeting ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:so um I d I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Cool .\nProject Manager:So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Play with play-dough . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh {disfmarker} I was gonna say concrete ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:but that's a slightly inappropriate word {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh can I just get some things clear just for {vocalsound} my sake .\nProject Manager:Yeah , certainly , of course .\nMarketing:Our energy source is gonna be\nProject Manager:I think I think we decided that we're gonna {disfmarker} for\nMarketing:long term .\nProject Manager:for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Cool . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I {disfmarker} you know , on the basis that um that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um {vocalsound} make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um .\nMarketing:And we're having a custom chip ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We're having a a custom chip , but given the the {disfmarker} we've cut the functions down , um that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that um technol technological innovation is important ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um .\nMarketing:And interchangeable case ?\nProject Manager:I i interchangeable case seems to be um {vocalsound} um important to the concept .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:And uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh {disfmarker} I mean uh uh this is totally new .\nMarketing:Mm , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:We d we don't know whether that {disfmarker} to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh {disfmarker} you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um it's uh it's good for the supermarket\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better .\nMarketing:And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I mean that's {disfmarker} no , because we've got so few buttons that it {disfmarker} that actually makes that redundant .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , does actually , yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think so too .\nMarketing:Cool .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and especially for making them so like different and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm different to feel ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:And the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would {disfmarker} well that would clobber the battery life ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yep , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so no , I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} As uh as wide\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} cer certainly wider angle than than current ,\nMarketing:As wide as possible .\nProject Manager:so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh {vocalsound} you know , i i it will work most of the time um .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm {vocalsound} yeah .\nUser Interface:Like this or like this .\nProject Manager:Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um yeah , I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , kinda like this whole {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , mm .\nProject Manager:Um so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So you could use like this and it would go {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , 'cause I mean the r reality is people are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um okay , d we're all clear where we go from here .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep , sounds good .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\n",
        "summary": "This is the third meeting of the design group. Project Manager raised the question left over from the last meeting. That is, what kind of energy source should be used. Industrial Designer preferred a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery, but Project Manager rejected and decided to use a long-term battery in light of the production cost. Then Industrial Designer described the advantages and disadvantages of custom-designed chips and chips off the shelf. Due to the significance of technological innovation, the team decided to choose the former. After discussion, the team agreed that they needed buttons for channel change, power, menu and volume, and proposed to add a slide button. In terms of the appearance design, Marketing proposed to follow the fashion and use a spongy material. In order to keep up with the changes in fashion, the team recommended interchangeable covers.",

I dunno where to put it 'cause the {disfmarker} Okay . Could you s take it off ? {gap} .\nMarketing:Is that alright ? {vocalsound} {gap} or {disfmarker} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Keeps coming off . 'S fiddly .\nProject Manager:Hmm . {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager:How do we sta wa how do we start ? Does anybody know ?\nMarketing:Oh , another one .\nProject Manager:So that's this {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh okay , right .\nIndustrial Designer:Are we free to take notes uh {disfmarker} Okay .\nProject Manager:Uh {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} {gap} . Hmm . Okay , just hang on a second everybody . I haven't actually looked at this yet .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Ah .\nProject Manager:{gap} um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Very nice .\nProject Manager:I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . If you're all ready .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So {gap} is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . Project aim is a new remote control . It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting . Tool training . Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um . Uh Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So are we supposed to bring the little things for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on {disfmarker} clip\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} do you have a belt ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Clip {gap} .\nProject Manager:Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap} okay . So my favourite animal {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , what's your favourite animal ?\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Ah .\nProject Manager:Is it rude ?\nMarketing:It's an elephant . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's a very good elephant .\nUser Interface:The back end of an elephant .\nMarketing:Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {vocalsound} okay , it's big , it's got a great memory .\nMarketing:Does it ? Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh dunno know why but {vocalsound} looks like nice to me .\nProject Manager:Okay . Wonderful , well done .\nIndustrial Designer:Nice animal .\nProject Manager:Do you want to use the wipe {disfmarker} the m the wiper and wipe it off ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Aesthetic yep , sure .\nMarketing:I have no idea what my favourite animal is .\nUser Interface:'Kay , my favourite animal ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:uh let's see .\nMarketing:Oh .\nUser Interface:Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before .\nMarketing:It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's a liger {vocalsound} ,\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:A what ?\nUser Interface:a combination of a lion and tiger {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Alright .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ?\nMarketing:How {gap} .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:Oh it's a hilarious movie .\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:You have to see it . And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , well done .\nMarketing:Great . Me ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Miss mar Miss Marketing ?\nMarketing:Okay . Not quite sure how this is gonna work .\nUser Interface:There {gap} go .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} well I'll try my best {vocalsound} to draw . Can I just draw the face ?\nProject Manager:Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ooh . It's a cat .\nProject Manager:That's a very pr pretty cat .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Which also has what ? A big fat body and big {disfmarker} and a long tail .\nProject Manager:Okay , do y do you wanna do some {disfmarker} write {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Why ?\nProject Manager:you wanna just write some words about it ?\nMarketing:Because um cuddly . And usually cats are very friendly . Usually . And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Wow , so they're kinda spiritual .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So , that's why I like cats .\nProject Manager:Well done .\nMarketing:There we are , that's me . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Uh . I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Really ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh that's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} no\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A prairie dog ?\nProject Manager:{gap} no {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh a squirrel ?\nProject Manager:That's exactly what it is .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh not a very good one {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Not bad I would say .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's pretty good .\nProject Manager:Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Very good .\nMarketing:Ah .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nProject Manager:Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros .\nMarketing:Market range internationally sold .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be {disfmarker} can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make .\nMarketing:Ah right okay .\nProject Manager:{gap} experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? Stuff like that . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . {vocalsound} At quarter to twelve . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So I think before we close uh , we are expected {disfmarker} I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:S\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think we're {disfmarker} I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:oh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would {disfmarker} roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? Pretty much everybody .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think we've all got {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:'Kay um .\nMarketing:Well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:T\nMarketing:A new remote control for T_V_ . What would I like ? {vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager:W what {disfmarker} You want it big do you want it small . Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Medium .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah it seems like there's like {disfmarker} there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Video and ts hi-fi and stuff .\nUser Interface:but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .\nProject Manager:Maybe you {disfmarker} yeah\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per {disfmarker} how much ?\nMarketing:Twelve fifty .\nIndustrial Designer:Twelve fifty . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit .\nMarketing:Each .\nProject Manager:Per unit , yeah .\nUser Interface:Cost .\nIndustrial Designer:So do we have to be realistic within the budget or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah .\nMarketing:Guess {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these {disfmarker} any of these ideas are feasible or not .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? {vocalsound} Like so you have one in like {disfmarker} mm\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:it doesn't have to be really thick . I mean remote controls can be thin bits . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing:{gap} have slides . And then it all comes compact\nProject Manager:Okay , that's {gap} .\nMarketing:into one . So it's not {disfmarker} you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Th that's an idea .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So you just flip them out .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {gap} have uh one very complicated one on one side with {vocalsound} all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o {vocalsound} one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and {vocalsound} minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .\nProject Manager:One side for kids , one side for adults .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'm not sure if that's like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Or grandma as well , you know it's like {vocalsound} what is the mute button .\nUser Interface:I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .\nIndustrial Designer:No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold {disfmarker} like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nProject Manager:Like it {gap}\nUser Interface:Oh okay .\nProject Manager:or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:That would be cool .\nProject Manager:F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe .\nMarketing:I was thinking that like a flip .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um , oh we've got five minutes left .\nIndustrial Designer:Start breaking up .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing:Okay . Um .\nProject Manager:Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there .\nUser Interface:Yeah , we should uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap} .\nUser Interface:I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception {disfmarker} you know {gap} stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:D_V_D_ players , things like that .\nProject Manager:I have got {disfmarker} I think we should also have a back-up plan of {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that {disfmarker} I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just {disfmarker} that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . Right .\nProject Manager:What do you reckon ? See 'cause , {gap} I'm just thinking {disfmarker} bearing in mind th we've gotta {disfmarker} we have to have something that's cheap to make .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I mean {gap} . Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker .\nUser Interface:have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:uh simple to use , and looks decent and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:May w you know , maybe even {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ?\nProject Manager:Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people\nMarketing:I mean if it's if it's just like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or so people that uh b don't see very well or {disfmarker} big buttons for {disfmarker} touchy buttons for {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or just one that looks really fucking cool .\nUser Interface:certain certain demographic {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Could be really light or , I dunno , something special .\nUser Interface:Yeah , no I think you're right . Yeah , rathe rather than focus on {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about {gap} do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Y {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I mean obviously everyone {disfmarker} we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but {vocalsound} that's not gonna happen .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this {disfmarker} well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and {disfmarker} ooh , the telephone's {disfmarker} the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something .\nProject Manager:Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . But make it like really snazzy and cool {gap} people will want it . So make it {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No porn channel for children .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Um alright ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so we've got some ideas , we've got um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I guess that's good good for now .\nProject Manager:Let's move on .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay .\nMarketing:W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ?\nProject Manager:Industrial Designer um which is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Ah ri okay . {gap} these are requirement specification .\nProject Manager:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:That's {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing:And I'm marketing .\nProject Manager:Yeah , there you go . {vocalsound} So {gap} {disfmarker} User Interface Designer , that's that's\nUser Interface:That's me . Okay .\nProject Manager:that's you , so you gotta {gap} you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um .\nUser Interface:Right . Right .\nProject Manager:Industrial Designer , you are the one {gap} , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's {gap} what goes into the box , somehow .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Har how it works an\nProject Manager:And in marketing {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Bu\nMarketing:{vocalsound} These are requirement specification .\nProject Manager:User requirements specifications .\nMarketing:So what the user requires\nProject Manager:Yeah , what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Do you think our two kind of overlap , because {disfmarker}\nMarketing:in a remote .\nProject Manager:Right , okay , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .\nMarketing:I guess that's what it says .\nProject Manager:You two {vocalsound} you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you {disfmarker} working together .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You're the one that's gotta go and find out {disfmarker} do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay . Okay everyone , well done .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Good meeting .\nUser Interface:Alright , see you in thirty minutes .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So {vocalsound} , do we take these off ?\nIndustrial Designer:I don't {disfmarker}\n",

Probably wanna get this other door , too . OK . So . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} What are we talking about today ?\nPhD E:Uh , well , first there are perhaps these uh Meeting Recorder digits that we tested .\nProfessor A:Oh , yeah . That was kind of uh interesting .\nPhD E:So .\nProfessor A:The {disfmarker} both the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the SRI System and the oth\nPhD E:Um .\nProfessor A:And for one thing that {disfmarker} that sure shows the {vocalsound} difference between having a lot of uh training data {vocalsound} or not ,\nPhD E:Of data ? Yeah .\nProfessor A:uh , the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The best kind of number we have on the English uh {disfmarker} on near microphone only is {disfmarker} is uh three or four percent .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:And uh it 's significantly better than that , using fairly simple front - ends {vocalsound} on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} on the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , with the SRI system .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:So I th I think that the uh {disfmarker} But that 's {disfmarker} that 's using uh a {disfmarker} a pretty huge amount of data , mostly not digits , of course , but {disfmarker} but then again {disfmarker} Well , yeah . In fact , mostly not digits for the actual training the H M Ms whereas uh in this case we 're just using digits for training the H M\nPhD E:Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A:Did anybody mention about whether the {disfmarker} the SRI system is a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is {disfmarker} is doing the digits um the wor as a word model or as uh a sub s sub - phone states ?\nPhD E:I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh allophone models ,\nProfessor A:Yeah . Probably .\nPhD E:so , well {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:Huh ?\nPhD E:Yeah . I think so , because it 's their very d huge , their huge system .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:And . But . So . There is one difference {disfmarker} Well , the SRI system {disfmarker} the result for the SRI system that are represented here are with adaptation . So there is {disfmarker} It 's their complete system and {disfmarker} including on - line uh unsupervised adaptation .\nProfessor A:That 's true .\nPhD E:And if you don't use adaptation , the error rate is around fifty percent worse , I think , if I remember .\nProfessor A:OK .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:It 's tha it 's that much , huh ?\nPhD E:Nnn . It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . It 's quite significant .\nProfessor A:Oh . OK .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:Still .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:But {disfmarker} but uh what {disfmarker} what I think I 'd be interested to do given that , is that we {disfmarker} we should uh {vocalsound} take {disfmarker} I guess that somebody 's gonna do this , right ? {disfmarker} is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the SRI system , right ?\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:We can do something like that .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Because {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Yeah . But {disfmarker} But I guess the main point is the data because uh {vocalsound} I am not sure . Our back - end is {disfmarker} is fairly simple but until now , well , the attempts to improve it or {disfmarker} have fail Ah , well , I mean uh what Chuck tried to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to do\nProfessor A:Yeah , but he 's doing it with the same data , right ? I mean so to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's two things being affected .\nPhD E:Yeah . So it 's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A:I mean . One is that {disfmarker} that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . We 've been playing a number of states\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:uh I {disfmarker} I don't know if he got to the point of playing with the uh number of Gaussians yet\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:but {disfmarker} but uh , uh , you know . But , yeah , so far he hadn't gotten any big improvement ,\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:but that 's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:And um .\nPhD E:Mmm . So , yeah , we could retrain some of these tandem on {disfmarker} on huge {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:Well , you could do that , but I 'm saying even with it not {disfmarker} with that part not retrained , just {disfmarker} just using {disfmarker} having the H M Ms {disfmarker} much better H M\nPhD E:Ah , yeah . Just {disfmarker} f for the HMM models .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:Yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Um . {vocalsound} But just train those H M Ms using different features , the features coming from our Aurora stuff .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:So .\nPhD E:Yeah . But {vocalsound} what would be interesting to see also is what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} perhaps it 's not related , the amount of data but the um recording conditions . I don't know . Because {vocalsound} it 's probably not a problem of noise , because our features are supposed to be robust to noise .\nProfessor A:Well , yeah .\nPhD E:It 's not a problem of channel , because there is um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} normalization with respect to the channel . So {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm sorry . What {disfmarker} what is the problem that you 're trying to explain ?\nPhD E:The {disfmarker} the fact that {disfmarker} the result with the tandem and Aurora system are {vocalsound} uh so much worse .\nProfessor A:That the {disfmarker} Oh . So much worse ? Oh .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:I uh but I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm almost certain that it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean , that it has to do with the um amount of training data .\nPhD E:It {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:It {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's orders of magnitude off .\nPhD E:Yeah but {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah but we train only on digits and it 's {disfmarker} it 's a digit task , so . Well .\nProfessor A:But {disfmarker} but having a huge {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data .\nPhD E:It {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:This is a modest amount of data .\nPhD E:Alright . Yeah .\nProfessor A:So . {vocalsound} I mean , ordinarily you would say \" well , given that you have enough occurrences of the digits , you can just train with digits rather than with , you know \" {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:But the thing is , if you have a huge {disfmarker} in other words , do word models {disfmarker} But if you have a huge amount of data then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar uh allophones .\nPhD E:Right . Mmm .\nProfessor A:And that 's just a huge amount of training for it .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:So it 's {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone ,\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:it 's really pretty clean data .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Um . Now , some of it could be the fact that uh {disfmarker} let 's see , in the {disfmarker} in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ?\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:I mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case .\nPhD E:Yeah . Well , actually we see that the clean train for the Aurora proposals are {disfmarker} are better than the multi - train ,\nProfessor A:It is if {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD E:yeah .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Cuz this is clean data , and so that 's not too surprising .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:But um . Uh . So .\nPhD E:Well , o I guess what I meant is that well , let 's say if we {disfmarker} if we add enough data to train on the um on the Meeting Recorder digits , I guess we could have better results than this .\nProfessor A:Uh - huh . Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:And . What I meant is that perhaps we can learn something uh from this , what 's {disfmarker} what 's wrong uh what {disfmarker} what is different between TI - digits and these digits and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:What kind of numbers are we getting on TI - digits ?\nPhD E:It 's point eight percent , so .\nProfessor A:Oh . I see .\nPhD E:Four - Fourier .\nProfessor A:So in the actual TI - digits database we 're getting point eight percent ,\nPhD E:Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor A:and here we 're getting three or four {disfmarker} three , let 's see , three for this ?\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Sure , but I mean , um point eight percent is something like double uh or triple what people have gotten who 've worked very hard at doing that .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:And {disfmarker} and also , as you point out , there 's adaptation in these numbers also . So if you , you know , put the ad adap take the adaptation off , then it {disfmarker} for the English - Near you get something like two percent .\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor A:And here you had , you know , something like three point four . And I could easily see that difference coming from this huge amount of data that it was trained on .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:So it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:You know , I don't think there 's anything magical here .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:It 's , you know , we used a simple HTK system with a modest amount of data . And this is a {disfmarker} a , you know , modern {vocalsound} uh system uh has {disfmarker} has a lot of nice points to it .\nPhD E:Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Um . So . I mean , the HTK is an older HTK , even . So . Yeah it {disfmarker} it 's not that surprising .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:But to me it just {disfmarker} it just meant a practical {vocalsound} point that um if we want to {vocalsound} publish results on digits that {disfmarker} that people pay {vocalsound} attention to we probably should uh {disfmarker} Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get {disfmarker} show some {vocalsound} nice improvement on something that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh , uh {disfmarker} it seems like too large a number , and uh {vocalsound} uh people don't necessarily take it so seriously .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Um . Yeah . Yeah . So the three point four percent for this uh is {disfmarker} is uh {disfmarker} So why is it {disfmarker} It 's an interesting question though , still . Why is {disfmarker} why is it three point four percent for the d the digits recorded in this environment as opposed to {vocalsound} the uh point eight percent for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for the original TI - digits database ? Um .\nPhD E:Yeah . th that 's {disfmarker} th that 's my point\nProfessor A:Given {disfmarker} given the same {disfmarker} Yeah . So ignore {disfmarker} ignoring the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the SRI system for a moment ,\nPhD E:I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't I {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:just looking at {vocalsound} the TI - di the uh tandem system , if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high . It 's , you know , it {disfmarker} it 's not awfully high ,\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:but it 's , you know {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's high . Um . {vocalsound} Why is it {vocalsound} uh four times as high , or more ?\nPhD E:Yeah , I guess .\nProfessor A:Right ? I mean , there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} even though it 's close - miked there 's still {disfmarker} there really is background noise .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Um . And {vocalsound} uh I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:It was not {disfmarker} I mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any {disfmarker} in any sense at all .\nPhD E:Well . Yeah . And acoustically , it 's q it 's {disfmarker} I listened . It 's quite different . TI - digit is {disfmarker} it 's very , very clean and it 's like studio recording\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:whereas these Meeting Recorder digits sometimes you have breath noise and Mmm .\nProfessor A:Right . Yeah . So I think they were {disfmarker}\nPhD E:It 's {nonvocalsound} not controlled at all , I mean .\nProfessor A:Bless you .\nGrad B:Thanks .\nProfessor A:I {disfmarker} Yeah . I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} So . Yes .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm . But\nProfessor A:It 's {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's the indication it 's harder .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:Uh . {vocalsound} Yeah and again , you know , i that 's true either way . I mean so take a look at the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um , the SRI results . I mean , they 're much much better , but still you 're getting something like one point three percent for uh things that are same data as in T {disfmarker} TI - digits the same {disfmarker} same text .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Uh . And uh , I 'm sure the same {disfmarker} same system would {disfmarker} would get , you know , point {disfmarker} point three or point four or something {vocalsound} on the actual TI - digits . So this {disfmarker} I think , on both systems the {vocalsound} these digits are showing up as harder .\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor A:Um .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Which I find sort of interesting cause I think this is closer to {disfmarker} uh I mean it 's still read . But I still think it 's much closer to {disfmarker} to what {disfmarker} what people actually face , {vocalsound} um when they 're {disfmarker} they 're dealing with people saying digits over the telephone . I mean . {vocalsound} I don't think uh {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers , but I don't think that uh {vocalsound} the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the companies that {disfmarker} that do telephone {vocalsound} speech get anything like point four percent on their {vocalsound} digits . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure they get {disfmarker} Uh , I mean , for one thing people do phone up who don't have uh uh Middle America accents and it 's a we we it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's US .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:it has {disfmarker} has many people {vocalsound} {vocalsound} who sound in many different ways . So . Um . I mean . OK . That was that topic . What else we got ?\nPhD E:Um .\nProfessor A:Did we end up giving up on {disfmarker} on , any Eurospeech submissions ,\nPhD E:But {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:or {disfmarker} ? I know Thilo and Dan Ellis are {disfmarker} are submitting something , but uh .\nPhD E:Yeah . I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess e the only thing with these {disfmarker} the Meeting Recorder and , well , {disfmarker} So , I think , yeah {disfmarker} I think we basically gave up .\nProfessor A:Um . {vocalsound} Now , actually for the {disfmarker} for the Aur - uh\nPhD E:But {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:we do have stuff for Aurora , right ? Because {disfmarker} because we have ano an extra month or something .\nPhD E:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So . Yeah , for sure we will do something for the special session .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Well , that 's fine . So th so {disfmarker} so we have a couple {disfmarker} a couple little things on Meeting Recorder\nPhD E:Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:and we have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We don't {disfmarker} we don't have to flood it with papers . We 're not trying to prove anything to anybody . so . That 's fine . Um . Anything else ?\nPhD E:Yeah . Well . So . Perhaps the point is that we 've been working on {vocalsound} is , yeah , we have put the um the good VAD in the system and {vocalsound} it really makes a huge difference . Um . So , yeah . I think , yeah , this is perhaps one of the reason why our system was not {disfmarker} {vocalsound} not the best , because with the new VAD , it 's very {disfmarker} the results are similar to the France Telecom results and perhaps even better sometimes .\nProfessor A:Hmm .\nGrad B:Huh .\nPhD E:Um . So there is this point . Uh . The problem is that it 's very big and {vocalsound} {vocalsound} we still have to think how to {disfmarker} where to put it and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um ,\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:because it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} well , this VAD uh either some delay and we {disfmarker} if we put it on the server side , it doesn't work , because on the server side features you already have LDA applied {vocalsound} from the f from the terminal side and {vocalsound} so you accumulate the delay so the VAD should be before the LDA which means perhaps on the terminal side and then smaller {vocalsound} and\nProfessor A:So wha where did this good VAD come from ?\nPhD E:So . It 's um from OGI . So it 's the network trained {disfmarker} it 's the network with the huge amounts on hidden {disfmarker} of hidden units , and um nine input frames compared to the VAD that was in the proposal which has a very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs .\nProfessor A:This is the one they had originally ?\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:Oh . Yeah , but they had to {pause} get rid of it because of the space , didn't they ?\nPhD E:Yeah . So . Yeah . But the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a VAD that 's small and that works fine . And . So we can {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:Well . So that 's a problem . Yeah .\nPhD E:Yeah but {disfmarker} nnn .\nProfessor A:But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely . I mean , uh i if {disfmarker} if there 's a {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know what the thinking was amongst the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} the ETSI folk but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . They just want , apparently {disfmarker} they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and {disfmarker} and VAD or frame dropping But they still {vocalsound} want to {disfmarker} just to give some um {vocalsound} requirement for this VAD because it 's {disfmarker} it will not be part of {disfmarker} they don't want it to be part of the standard .\nProfessor A:OK .\nPhD E:So . So it must be at least uh somewhat fixed but not completely . So there just will be some requirements that are still not {disfmarker} uh not yet uh ready I think .\nProfessor A:Determined . I see . But I was thinking that {disfmarker} that uh {vocalsound} s \" Sure , there may be some interaction ,\nPhD E:Nnn .\nProfessor A:but I don't think we need to be stuck on using our or OGI 's {pause} VAD . We could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller or {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:You know , as long as it did the job .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:So that 's good .\nPhD E:Uh . So there is this thing . There is um {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh I designed a new {disfmarker} a new filter because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , {vocalsound} there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds\nProfessor A:Right .\nPhD E:and {vocalsound} uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s I think it 's sixty - five .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:Yeah . Both should have sixty - five because {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:You didn't gain anything , right ?\nPhD E:Yeah . And . So I did that and uh it 's running . So , {vocalsound} let 's see what will happen . Uh but the filter is of course closer to the reference filter .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:Mmm . Um . Yeah . I think {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:So that means logically , in principle , it should be better . So probably it 'll be worse .\nPhD E:Yeah\nProfessor A:Or in the basic perverse nature uh of reality . Yeah . OK .\nPhD E:Yeah . Sure .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor A:OK .\nPhD E:Yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of um voiced - unvoiced stuff .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:And next week I think we will {vocalsound} perhaps try to have um a new system with uh uh MSG stream also see what {disfmarker} what happens . So , something that 's similar to the proposal too , but with MSG stream .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor A:OK .\nPhD D:No , I w {vocalsound} I begin to play {vocalsound} with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision . But only to play . And we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they {disfmarker} we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the {vocalsound} sq the variance {vocalsound} between the um FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} after the um mel filter bank .\nProfessor A:Uh - huh .\nPhD D:And , well , is more or less robust . Is good for clean speech . Is quite good {vocalsound} for noisy speech .\nProfessor A:Huh ? Mm - hmm .\nPhD D:but um we must to have bigger statistic with TIMIT ,\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD D:and is not ready yet to use on ,\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD D:well , I don't know .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:Yeah . So , basically we wa want to look at something like the ex the ex excitation signal and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:Right .\nPhD D:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:which are the variance of it and {disfmarker}\nPhD D:I have here . I have here for one signal , for one frame .\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Uh - huh .\nPhD D:The {disfmarker} the mix of the two , noise and unnoise , and the signal is this . Clean , and this noise .\nProfessor A:Uh .\nPhD D:These are the two {disfmarker} the mixed , the big signal is for clean .\nProfessor A:Well , I 'm s uh {disfmarker} There 's {disfmarker} None of these axes are labeled , so I don't know what this {disfmarker} What 's this axis ?\nPhD D:Uh this is uh {disfmarker} this axis is {vocalsound} nnn , \" frame \" .\nProfessor A:Frame .\nPhD D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:And what 's th what this ?\nPhD D:Uh , this is uh energy , log - energy of the spectrum . Of the this is the variance , the difference {nonvocalsound} between the spectrum of the signal and FFT of each frame of the signal and this mouth spectrum of time after the f may fit for the two ,\nProfessor A:For this one . For the noi\nPhD D:this big , to here , they are to signal . This is for clean and this is for noise .\nProfessor A:Oh . There 's two things on the same graph .\nPhD D:Yeah . I don't know . I {disfmarker} I think that I have d another graph , but I 'm not sure .\nProfessor A:So w which is clean and which is noise ?\nPhD E:Yeah . I think the lower one is noise .\nPhD D:The lower is noise and the height is clean .\nProfessor A:OK . So it 's harder to distinguish\nPhD D:It 's height .\nProfessor A:but it {disfmarker} but it g\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:with noise of course but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}\nPhD D:Oh . I must to have .\nProfessor A:Uh .\nPhD D:Pity , but I don't have two different\nProfessor A:And presumably when there 's a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker}\nPhD E:So this should the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the t voiced portions .\nProfessor A:Uh - huh .\nPhD D:Yeah , it is the height is voiced portion .\nPhD E:The p the peaks should be voiced portion .\nPhD D:And this is the noise portion .\nProfessor A:Uh - huh .\nPhD D:And this is more or less like this . But I meant to have see @ @ two {disfmarker} two the picture .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD D:This is , for example , for one frame .\nProfessor A:Yeah\nPhD D:the {disfmarker} the spectrum of the signal . And this is the small version of the spectrum after ML mel filter bank .\nProfessor A:Yeah . And this is the difference ?\nPhD D:And this is I don't know . This is not the different . This is trying to obtain {vocalsound} with LPC model the spectrum but using Matlab without going factor and s\nProfessor A:No pre - emphasis ? Yeah .\nPhD D:Not pre - emphasis . Nothing .\nProfessor A:Yeah so it 's {disfmarker} doesn't do too well there .\nPhD D:And the {disfmarker} I think that this is good . This is quite similar . this is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this is another frame . ho how I obtained the {vocalsound} envelope , {nonvocalsound} this envelope , with the mel filter bank .\nProfessor A:Right . So now I wonder {disfmarker} I mean , do you want to {disfmarker} I know you want to get at something orthogonal from what you get with the smooth spectrum Um . But if you were to really try and get a voiced - unvoiced , do you {disfmarker} do you want to totally ignore that ? I mean , do you {disfmarker} do you {disfmarker} I mean , clearly a {disfmarker} a very big {disfmarker} very big cues {vocalsound} for voiced - unvoiced come from uh spectral slope and so on , right ?\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Um .\nPhD E:Yeah . Well , this would be {disfmarker} this would be perhaps an additional parameter ,\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:simply isn't {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:I see .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nPhD D:Yeah because when did noise clear {nonvocalsound} in these section is clear\nPhD E:Uh .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD D:if s @ @ {nonvocalsound} val value is indicative that is a voice frame and it 's low values\nProfessor A:Yeah . Yeah . Well , you probably want {disfmarker} I mean , {vocalsound} certainly if {vocalsound} you want to do good voiced - unvoiced detection , you need a few features . Each {disfmarker} each feature is {vocalsound} by itself not enough . But , you know , people look at {disfmarker} at slope and {vocalsound} uh first auto - correlation coefficient , divided by power .\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor A:Or {disfmarker} or uh um there 's uh {disfmarker} I guess we prob probably don't have enough computation to do a simple pitch detector or something ? I mean with a pitch detector you could have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} have a {disfmarker} an estimate of {disfmarker} of what the {disfmarker}\nPhD E:Mmm .\nProfessor A:Uh . Or maybe you could you just do it going through the P FFT 's figuring out some um probable {vocalsound} um harmonic structure . Right . And {disfmarker} and uh .\nPhD E:Mmm .\nPhD D:you have read up and {disfmarker} you have a paper , {vocalsound} the paper that you s give me yesterday . they say that yesterday {vocalsound} they are some {nonvocalsound} problem\nPhD E:Oh , yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah , but it 's not {disfmarker} it 's , yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's another problem .\nPhD D:and the {disfmarker} Is another problem .\nPhD E:Yeah Um . Yeah , there is th this fact actually . If you look at this um spectrum ,\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:What 's this again ? Is it {vocalsound} the mel - filters ?\nPhD D:Yeah like this . Of kind like this .\nPhD E:Yeah . OK . So the envelope here is the output of the mel - filters\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:and what we clearly see is that in some cases , and it clearly appears here , and the {disfmarker} the harmonics are resolved by the f Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering ,\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:and it happens {vocalsound} for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters {vocalsound} is sometimes even smaller than the pitch .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:It 's around one hundred , one hundred and fifty hertz {vocalsound} Nnn .\nProfessor A:Right .\nPhD E:And so what happens is that this uh , add additional variability to this envelope and {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that {disfmarker} that 's smoother on low frequencies .\nProfessor A:That 's as {disfmarker} as a separate thing .\nPhD E:i\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:Yeah . This is a separate thing .\nProfessor A:Separate thing ?\nPhD D:Yeah .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD E:And .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Maybe so . Um . Yeah . So , what {disfmarker} Yeah . What I was talking about was just , starting with the FFT you could {disfmarker} you could uh do a very rough thing to estimate {disfmarker} estimate uh pitch .\nPhD E:Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:And uh uh , given {disfmarker} you know , given that , uh {vocalsound} you could uh uh come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was {disfmarker} was explained by {disfmarker} {vocalsound} by uh uh those harmonics .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Uh . It 's uh a variant on what you 're s what you 're doing . The {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} the mel does give a smooth thing . But as you say it 's not that smooth here . And {disfmarker} and so if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you just you know subtracted off uh your guess of the harmonics then something like this would end up with {vocalsound} quite a bit lower energy in the first fifteen hundred hertz or so and {disfmarker} and our first kilohertz , even .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:And um {vocalsound} if was uh noisy , the proportion that it would go down would be if it was {disfmarker} if it was unvoiced or something .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:So you oughta be able to {vocalsound} pick out voiced segments . At least it should be another {disfmarker} another cue . So . {vocalsound} Anyway .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:OK ? That 's what 's going on . Uh . What 's up with you ?\nGrad B:Um {vocalsound} our t I went to {vocalsound} talk with uh Mike Jordan this {disfmarker} this week\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:um {nonvocalsound} and uh {vocalsound} shared with him the ideas about um {vocalsound} extending the Larry Saul work and um I asked him some questions about factorial H M so like later down the line when {vocalsound} we 've come up with these {disfmarker} these feature detectors , how do we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how do we uh {vocalsound} you know , uh model the time series that {disfmarker} that happens um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and {vocalsound} and we talked a little bit about {vocalsound} factorial H M Ms and how {vocalsound} um when you 're doing inference {disfmarker} or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple Viterbi stuff that you can do for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for these H M and {vocalsound} the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} don't over - alert the problem there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} on uh the sub - problems at hand so {vocalsound} you can imagine {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} five or so parallel {vocalsound} um features um transitioning independently and then {vocalsound} at the end you {disfmarker} you uh couple these factorial H M Ms with uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with uh undirected links um based on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} based on some more data .\nProfessor A:Hmm .\nGrad B:So he {disfmarker} he seemed {disfmarker} he seemed like really interested in {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in um {disfmarker} in this and said {disfmarker} said this is {disfmarker} this is something very do - able and can learn a lot and um yeah , I 've just been {vocalsound} continue reading um about certain things .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:um thinking of maybe using um {vocalsound} um m modulation spectrum stuff to {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} as features um also in the {disfmarker} in the sub - bands\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:because {vocalsound} it seems like {vocalsound} the modulation um spectrum tells you a lot about the intelligibility of {disfmarker} of certain um words and stuff So , um . Yeah . Just that 's about it .\nProfessor A:OK .\nGrad C:OK . And um so I 've been looking at Avendano 's work and um uh I 'll try to write up in my next stat status report a nice description of {vocalsound} what he 's doing , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's an approach to deal with {vocalsound} reverberation or that {disfmarker} the aspect of his work that I 'm interested in the idea is that um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} normally an analysis frames are um {vocalsound} too short to encompass reverberation effects um in full . You miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window and so {vocalsound} {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you 'd like it to be that {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} the reverberation responses um simply convolved um in , but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames cuz you j But if you take , say , a two millisecond {vocalsound} um window {disfmarker} I 'm sorry a two second window then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response {vocalsound} is included in the window and the {disfmarker} then it um {vocalsound} then things are l more linear . It is {disfmarker} it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved and um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and you can use channel normalization techniques {vocalsound} like uh in his thesis he 's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed . He just does um {vocalsound} mean subtraction , which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum and {vocalsound} that 's supposed to d um deal {disfmarker} uh deal pretty well with the um reverberation and um {vocalsound} the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer um {vocalsound} so he does this {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} method training trading the um {vocalsound} the spectral resolution for time resolution {vocalsound} and um {vocalsound} come ca uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s um {vocalsound} frequency resolution . So I don't really know the theory . I guess it 's {disfmarker} these are called \" time frequency representations \" and h he 's making the {disfmarker} the time sh um finer grained and the frequency resolution um less fine grained .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:s so I 'm {disfmarker} I guess my first stab actually in continuing {vocalsound} his work is to um {vocalsound} re - implement this {disfmarker} this thing which um {vocalsound} changes the time and frequency resolutions cuz he doesn't have code for me . So that that 'll take some reading about the theory . I don't really know the theory .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:Oh , and um , {vocalsound} another f first step is um , so the {disfmarker} the way I want to extend his work is make it able to deal with a time varying reverberation response um {vocalsound} and um we don't really know {vocalsound} how fast the um {disfmarker} the reverberation response is varying the Meeting Recorder data um so um {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} we have this um block least squares um imp echo canceller implementation and um {vocalsound} I want to try {vocalsound} finding {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the response , say , between a near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller and looking at the echo canceller taps and then {vocalsound} see how fast that varies {vocalsound} from block to block .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:That should give an idea of how fast the reverberation response is changing .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:OK . Um . I think we 're {vocalsound} sort of done .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:So let 's read our digits and go home .\nGrad C:Um . S so um y you do {disfmarker} I think you read some of the {disfmarker} the zeros as O 's and some as zeros .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nGrad C:Is there a particular way we 're supposed to read them ?\nPhD E:There are only zeros here . Well .\nProfessor A:No . \" O \" {disfmarker} \" O \" {disfmarker} \" O \" \" O \" {disfmarker} \" O \" {disfmarker} \" O \" and \" zero \" are two ways that we say that digit .\nPhD E:Eee . Yeah .\nProfessor A:So it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Ha !\nPhD E:But {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:so it 's {disfmarker} i\nPhD E:Perhaps in the sheets there should be another sign for the {disfmarker} if we want to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the guy to say \" O \" or\nProfessor A:No . I mean . I think people will do what they say .\nPhD E:It 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:It 's OK .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor A:I mean in digit recognition we 've done before , you have {disfmarker} you have two pronunciations for that value , \" O \" and \" zero \" .\nGrad C:Alright .\nPhD E:OK .\nGrad C:OK .\nPhD E:But it 's perhaps more difficult for the people to prepare the database then , if {disfmarker} because here you only have zeros\nProfessor A:No , they just write {disfmarker}\nPhD E:and {disfmarker} and people pronounce \" O \" or zero {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:they {disfmarker} they write down OH . or they write down ZERO a and they {disfmarker} and they each have their own pronunciation .\nPhD E:Yeah but if the sh the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the \" O \" .\nProfessor A:But people wouldn't know what that wa I mean {vocalsound} there is no convention for it .\nPhD E:OK . Yeah .\nProfessor A:See . I mean , you 'd have to tell them {vocalsound} \" OK when we write this , say it tha \" ,\nPhD E:OK .\nProfessor A:you know , and you just {disfmarker} They just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would\nPhD E:Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor A:and {disfmarker} and people say it different ways .\nPhD E:Yep .\nGrad C:OK . Is this a change from the last batch of {disfmarker} of um forms ? Because in the last batch it was spelled out which one you should read .\nPhD E:Yeah , it was orthographic , so .\nProfessor A:Yes . That 's right . It was {disfmarker} it was spelled out , and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things .\nGrad C:Oh . OK .\nProfessor A:That 's also why they 're {disfmarker} they 're bunched together in these different groups . So {disfmarker} so it 's {disfmarker}\nGrad C:OK .\nProfessor A:Yeah . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} Everything 's fine .\nGrad C:OK .\nProfessor A:OK . Actually , let me just s since {disfmarker} since you brought it up , I was just {disfmarker} it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it {vocalsound} after we {disfmarker} since we just discussed it . But I realized that {disfmarker} that um {vocalsound} when I 'm talking on the phone , certainly , and {disfmarker} and saying these numbers , {vocalsound} I almost always say zero . And uh {disfmarker} cuz {disfmarker} because uh i it 's two syllables . It 's {disfmarker} it 's more likely they 'll understand what I said . So that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's the habit I 'm in , but some people say \" O \" and {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Yeah I normally say \" O \" cuz it 's easier to say .\nProfessor A:Yeah it 's shorter . Yeah . So it 's {disfmarker} So . {vocalsound} So uh .\nGrad B:\" O \"\nProfessor A:Now , don't think about it .\nGrad B:Oh , no !\nProfessor A:OK . We 're done .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting focused on the results from the existing model, speeding up the backend for feature direction, and a few tangential topics being developed for future exploration. The team was unsure why their model was not performing as well as they expected it to, and they suspected that their smaller dataset might be at fault. They also discussed how they could improve the performance of the backend model by improving feature detection. The meeting ended with some students sharing the tangential fields they were exploring and a brief discussion on the different pronunciations of zero.",

Time is it ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Fourteen twenty six .\nProject Manager:Okay . Lovely to see you all again . Um {vocalsound} it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . Um okay {vocalsound} our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . So\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . {vocalsound} And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece {vocalsound} and a long-life battery or a charging station . Okay , now three presentations . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials {vocalsound} um and then the conceptual specification of user interface {vocalsound} and finally trend watching .\nIndustrial Designer:That would be me .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright . Well .\nProject Manager:Mm . 'kay . Function F_ eight it . There we go .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright . Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . {vocalsound} Um . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . {vocalsound} Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here . {vocalsound} Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um {vocalsound} using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um {vocalsound} complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . {vocalsound} So those are our options . Um personal preferences that I was thinking through {disfmarker} here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . And we wanna go for simplicity . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:any ideas on that ? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . {vocalsound} Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . That's what I have for options . Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Is double-curved like {disfmarker} would be like two hands kind of thing ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not sure . I haven't received any specific\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:visuals of this yet .\nMarketing:'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve\nIndustrial Designer:This is what I'm sort of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . I'm not sure ,\nMarketing:but I've no idea .\nIndustrial Designer:but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures .\nMarketing:Sounds good .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I wonder {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite {disfmarker} they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Space-age remote .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Just an interesting marketing kind of element .\nIndustrial Designer:Just all things to keep in mind . Yeah . {vocalsound} That's about all I have to do , guys . I hope I didn't go through that too quickly .\nProject Manager:Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , n\nProject Manager:no idea , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:no idea , no idea . Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and that a tita titanium is very light , I know ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:um but other than {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:that's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright ? Any other questions ?\nUser Interface:Uh-huh . Don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer:No ? Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look\nProject Manager:Thank you , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer:and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Thanks .\nProject Manager:Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um {disfmarker} underneath our {disfmarker} oh , uh in your book ,\nIndustrial Designer:Just in my notebook ,\nProject Manager:then don't worry about that .\nIndustrial Designer:but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ? Uh I guess I can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , um . This one's so much tighter than the other one .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I know .\nProject Manager:Okay . Nope . There we go . Here you are .\nUser Interface:Jess .\nIndustrial Designer:G oh , geez .\nUser Interface:Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . Um other {disfmarker} we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include {disfmarker} that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:how how {disfmarker} what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So basically ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:that's what we don't want . {vocalsound} M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Here's a a fairly simple device . This is an an iPod from Apple . Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . It's very minimalistic in its design . Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . Um {vocalsound} the thing I like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features . Uh you can just about make out uh that the button {disfmarker} three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um {vocalsound} here's a another example . This is uh {disfmarker} it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . Um it's certainly got novelty value .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of {disfmarker} yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . So I {vocalsound} I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . Um but these are these are all necessary functions . Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ?\nUser Interface:I think that's {vocalsound} that's one way to go , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's {disfmarker} it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're {vocalsound} I {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right\nUser Interface:well we're {disfmarker} I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . The alternative is to have a {vocalsound} an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your {disfmarker} this thing of watch lo what's on each channel .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:I mean that that's also a good idea . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um and so\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's {disfmarker} um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it .\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker} Are you are you tak\nProject Manager:Like I I know I use that often enough .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ?\nProject Manager:Well\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box ,\nUser Interface:But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way ,\nProject Manager:mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , good point .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um I'm not sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , now we're moving on to market . Marketing .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Should I plug that in ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Is that going on ? Okay .\nMarketing:Maybe it's just not {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh that should be alright , actually .\nMarketing:Is it on ? Ri What F_ do you have to press ,\nProject Manager:Eight .\nMarketing:five ? I just keep pressing lots of 'em . Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . {vocalsound} If anything , the {gap} that they gave me .\nProject Manager:Oops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough .\nIndustrial Designer:No signal .\nMarketing:Alright .\nProject Manager:There we are .\nIndustrial Designer:Oop , there we go .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . {vocalsound} Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So first um they had people {disfmarker} they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:so just to take that weight into account . {vocalsound} The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . I don't know how much we agree with that . {vocalsound} And then {vocalsound} the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , {vocalsound} tight material .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:S sweet .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And so that brings us to my personal preferences . Who wants a spongy remote or one with {vocalsound} fruit and vegetable padding .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily {vocalsound} wanna take away .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to {vocalsound} like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . {vocalsound} But {vocalsound} it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That {disfmarker} there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:that pretty much sums it up . So yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , do we have any {disfmarker} s some questions for this , let's see um .\nMarketing:Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ?\nProject Manager:Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ?\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands .\nIndustrial Designer:If it's latex {disfmarker} if it's latexy {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's kind of {disfmarker} and then it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Um , mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that ,\nUser Interface:A kind of thing that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I dunno . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:An uh I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} th {vocalsound} my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's {disfmarker} there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to {disfmarker} R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nMarketing:Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess\nIndustrial Designer:something grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's {disfmarker} that seems doable . {vocalsound} could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them ,\nProject Manager:F for sure , or maybe like\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:li\nProject Manager:um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something .\nIndustrial Designer:The buttons could be fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager:Could they be smelly ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh well\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh God .\nProject Manager:I don't know .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Or carrot shaped ,\nIndustrial Designer:it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot\nProject Manager:mm .\nIndustrial Designer:isn't it ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Maybe ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Like large button ,\nIndustrial Designer:Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .\nUser Interface:or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:that's what I was thinking of , yeah .\nMarketing:What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} be {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Kind of like a potato .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Might {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think .\nProject Manager:would you think you you {disfmarker} do you think you'd be able to hold it ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Just to tie it in a little .\nProject Manager:'Cause I think the reason they're long is {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It'd be harder to press button .\nProject Manager:Harder to push .\nUser Interface:Depends . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? Or your fingers ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I usually hold it in one hand . Maybe {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb .\nProject Manager:But then the buttons would have to be very small .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's ts how I tend to do it .\nProject Manager:Don't you think ?\nIndustrial Designer:No\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:just thumb-sized .\nMarketing:'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around .\nIndustrial Designer:Jus\nProject Manager:But I mean in order to get to all of them ,\nMarketing:But I like i\nProject Manager:you know .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:That's true .\nUser Interface:But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel .\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker} And you find that works quite well ?\nMarketing:I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Is that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Cause th\nUser Interface:The button on an iPod , is it {disfmarker} what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ?\nMarketing:It's like five ,\nProject Manager:It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel .\nIndustrial Designer:It {disfmarker} wel well {vocalsound}\nMarketing:'cause there's one in the middle .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , it would {disfmarker} I mean each version of it has been a little bit different ,\nProject Manager:The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . Ts and you press the centre button ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:that's that's your all-purpose select button right there .\nUser Interface:Oh , I see , right , yeah . Oh , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's quite a good design .\nMarketing:I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Like just the idea of like those {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh uh\nMarketing:so few buttons for main things ,\nIndustrial Designer:t\nMarketing:but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ?\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And then you could still have that available .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think an {vocalsound} L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .\nUser Interface:I think it could be difficult in practice ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and people don't wanna do that .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left ,\nIndustrial Designer:Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ?\nProject Manager:so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this {disfmarker} these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} 'Kay .\nProject Manager:before we move on . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Could {disfmarker} Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours ,\nMarketing:If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know .\nUser Interface:Like , to make it different fruits . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's possible .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly .\nProject Manager:wherea but the actual model could be titanium .\nIndustrial Designer:And you could co-ordinate with your house {vocalsound} or whatever . All these options .\nUser Interface:I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel .\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh .\nUser Interface:So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well ,\nProject Manager:Ah hmm hmm hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Don't know . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:there we go . The iPod packaging is me like was so {disfmarker} that was like half the fun .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's like the way it all comes all cute .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Options .\nMarketing:Lemons ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , um {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:components concept . Energy , chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-hu oh , oh yes .\nProject Manager:G\nIndustrial Designer:Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get {disfmarker} be necessary but um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ?\nIndustrial Designer:Alright , so um decisions , what the {disfmarker} okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool .\nIndustrial Designer:Am I {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , I mean , it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right , I haven't gotten any {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but as far as I know , the technology is good .\nMarketing:Costs .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think .\nMarketing:But over time {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Um circuit boards . Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . They're {vocalsound} they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um yeah , I can't can't really tell you . I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . But I don't know any decisions on {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:If they're if they're really options .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I'm sorry ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I did f\nUser Interface:Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Uh it's fairly fairly standard .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um okay , then we'll move on to the case . Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that . Um , {vocalsound} 'kay , the pushbutton {disfmarker} if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ?\nUser Interface:Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . I mean it might be nice for changing the volume .\nProject Manager:It would be nice for changing the volume ,\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers\nUser Interface:I don't think it would really work .\nMarketing:Yeah , it's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel .\nIndustrial Designer:th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We have five minutes left for the meeting , so .\nMarketing:and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as {disfmarker} I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no {disfmarker} it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:So , have a scroll for volume ?\nIndustrial Designer:F or for all those secret functions ?\nProject Manager:F\nIndustrial Designer:When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus .\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker} yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Right . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending {disfmarker} and maybe we could table that decision for later .\nProject Manager:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know .\nProject Manager:I think w well {disfmarker} I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide {disfmarker} the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case .\nProject Manager:Okay , let's do case .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah , everything I've {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer:N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that {vocalsound} there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The inside is hard . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board ,\nProject Manager:Ge o\nIndustrial Designer:I think that that's done for us .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:'Kay . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we uh we do want latex .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Fruity colours . {vocalsound} Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ?\nProject Manager:Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ?\nMarketing:I'm thinking curved of some sort .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We don't really know what the difference {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um okay , interface , the type and the supplements . So push or scroll ,\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:right ? Or both ?\nUser Interface:Yep . Um {disfmarker} And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button .\nIndustrial Designer:Good point .\nUser Interface:So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , it's uh {vocalsound} it's it's fairly simple .\nProject Manager:I think that {disfmarker} yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll {disfmarker} an actual {disfmarker} like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Is that okay with you ?\nIndustrial Designer:because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:How you feeling ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .\nProject Manager:It might be cool enough .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements ,\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:how are we gonna do that ?\nUser Interface:Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ?\nProject Manager:Um I assume that's what else we're gonna {disfmarker} like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So we're gonna have like a menu button ,\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:so that we can access on-screen things then ?\nUser Interface:Yep . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nUser Interface:Um in {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So what are what are our buttons gonna be ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . On off ,\nIndustrial Designer:On off {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu .\nIndustrial Designer:So like one through five , or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah\nMarketing:Like a radio type sorta situation ?\nUser Interface:about {disfmarker} yeah like {disfmarker} yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , right ?\nUser Interface:Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:I think maybe numbers seems {disfmarker} is kind of old-fashioned .\nProject Manager:Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , you can just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , up down .\nUser Interface:but the volume control could double for that , for example .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay , um finishing the meeting now . Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Cool . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Wow .\nProject Manager:Um did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ?\nIndustrial Designer:Simple chip .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:We are done . Thank you everyone . Oh I di these are already in our shared folder , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , cool . Clay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Clay . I wasn't expecting that . {vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "This meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control. Firstly, groupmates presented on the conceptual specification on components, properties and materials as well as a conceptual specification on user interface design. Also, they suggested conceptual designs including the buttons, the circuit board, the chip to print as well as the LCD screen with backlighting in the device. Then, the group had a discussion on the final remote control concepts. So, they decided to have changeable covers in fruity colours, rechargeable batteries and scroll wheels. And they would leave the spongy case and the standard of the chip to be discussed in the next meeting.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . Okay , well\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I'd say let's start with the first presentation .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Um in the same order as last time ?\nIndustrial Designer:W sure .\nUser Interface:Mm . Alright .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well , take it away .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound} Okay uh welcome you all .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Components design , um {vocalsound} uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh {disfmarker} elaborate some of the things I did . I I elaborated on the concept . What should be um uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um {vocalsound} you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . {vocalsound} I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about .\nMarketing:Don't destroy my giraffe .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Giraffe's gone now .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . There's one of the {disfmarker} because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control\nMarketing:Drop it .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . But uh it's a very expensive material . Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to {disfmarker} it lets lets itself colour . Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . But it's a very strong material . Um {vocalsound} I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh so it's t two dimensional . I think it's uh it's best to draw oh\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's a colour . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:green .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Bright colour . Fancy colour . Forward .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} New . Blank . Okay .\nMarketing:You have to go t\nIndustrial Designer:Let's make it uh black . Okay . I thought of an idea like this . Oh {gap} that . {vocalsound} Um delete . Blank . Okay . So it also looks nice when it's on your table .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:So you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands .\nMarketing:Oh it's a side view .\nIndustrial Designer:Side view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some {gap} or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component .\nMarketing:True .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh {vocalsound} the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . Questions , {gap} ?\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No no no no no . Just looking .\nIndustrial Designer:And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side . Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . That was correct , wasn't it ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind ,\nProject Manager:but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:wasn't it ? Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ?\nProject Manager:It must be recognisable .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay okay . Well that's possible of course .\nUser Interface:You can put the R_ and R_ . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:We could make a little R_ and R_ {gap} on the top of the machine . Uh so they are {vocalsound} pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh {vocalsound} them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . Well that's all about my uh my findings .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nProject Manager:Okay , thank you .\nUser Interface:I will go next .\nMarketing:Mm mm mm . Next .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Alright so\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . And uh {vocalsound} uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . Um perhaps it's useful ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:perhaps for because people um lose the remote ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:they can yell uh remote where are you and {gap} calls or something .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's true .\nUser Interface:And perhaps we could uh implement that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like\nIndustrial Designer:Oh my God . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but I can't draw , so uh don't {vocalsound} make too much of it {vocalsound} . I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw {gap} . I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . I don't know if there is an icon for the program , but\nIndustrial Designer:Not just a P_ .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:P_ yeah , just a P_ .\nUser Interface:So uh\nIndustrial Designer:.. . {gap}\nUser Interface:and then the buttons above and uh below\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . Um .\nMarketing:Where's where's the button for two {gap} ?\nUser Interface:I forgot that one . {vocalsound} I thought I forgot something ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:but uh {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah .\nMarketing:Doesn't matter .\nUser Interface:Um an options button . And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:So could call it settings or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:But this is a bit uh how I thought it . And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand or something uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh okay ,\nUser Interface:But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , {gap} .\nUser Interface:And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh {disfmarker} And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Okay .\nUser Interface:That's an option . And that was my uh finding dinge .\nProject Manager:Thanks .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Now our third\nIndustrial Designer:Go Danny , go Danny . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:team member with his presentation .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 'Kay . The method I used was {disfmarker} Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's {vocalsound} quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . And the third thing is it should be easy to use . I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .\nIndustrial Designer:Fruity ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Grass green .\nIndustrial Designer:Fruity . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Like that . The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Okay .\nMarketing:It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Let's build it into a sponge .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Th Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . They liked square shapes with round edges . And hard materials like wood , um titanium . They those kind of materials they liked . This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like\nProject Manager:Oh y {vocalsound}\nMarketing:this or something . It's it's a bit like a banana . And the colour should be yellow , or something .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:And for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ?\nUser Interface:It was one remote , I think ,\nMarketing:Different colours , yeah .\nUser Interface:different colours .\nMarketing:We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So that's it .\nProject Manager:So for the older people , a more traditional uh form .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:That is my {disfmarker} Yeah , like the older o older colours I can maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . I don't know which shape you should should take ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Colours th the elderly people {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ?\nProject Manager:the shape of it .\nUser Interface:Perhaps you could find something in the middle . Round but square . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , s\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:round corners , but s but square , yeah .\nProject Manager:But maybe then both groups won't buy it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I know what you mean , kind of like a {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} wait , like {vocalsound} like this {vocalsound} uh a bit .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round .\nIndustrial Designer:Kinda like a beer glass . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:So but then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I know what you mean .\nUser Interface:Same sides . {vocalsound} But that's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's also easy to to have {vocalsound} to to put in your hand .\nUser Interface:Yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's uh {disfmarker} But perhaps that's a good thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so that's easy to use . People know the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Will recognise that's as a remote control .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker} Look something like that {gap} . Autumn colours like red , brown .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh when I saw your d Oh .\nMarketing:They liked the wood a lot .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , kinda like old cars , uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Swords . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Let's put it all together .\nMarketing:Those kind of {disfmarker} Yeah , those kind of things . So you see the big difference between the young people ? Fresh , exciting .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:And the old people , old and boring .\nUser Interface:But that's easily to do with the colour , I think .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nUser Interface:That's easy to do with the colours , I think .\nMarketing:Yeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah we think so too .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nMarketing:Because otherwise we have to {gap} get different shapes , and colour {gap} way easier than yeah the shapes . In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and the old people like {vocalsound} plain wood .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that .\nUser Interface:Yeah think uh {disfmarker} Also in between . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Soft rubber .\nMarketing:Yeah {gap} soft rubber\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:which you can you can feel in it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I know what you {disfmarker} Um .\nUser Interface:I don't think you should be able to mould it ,\nMarketing:Or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It should shouldn't be {gap} .\nMarketing:No . Or or wh what's something harder . No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:or something harder .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:Bit like this kind of rubber . This uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , something like this , yeah .\nUser Interface:But it's quite hard , this .\nMarketing:Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's feels kind s spongy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Spongy .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I don't think it's rubber .\nMarketing:No . N n n\nProject Manager:So we need a spongy feeling . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh did you have something about uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So we should first decide about shape , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Ding ding .\nUser Interface:Which uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah I think that's the better thing to do . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it ,\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:and can decide uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I also s uh can't help but notice {vocalsound} that you uh used an {disfmarker} you had a remote control {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um .\nMarketing:Yeah\nUser Interface:Yeah\nMarketing:w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit\nIndustrial Designer:.. . This was your size ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but I think it should be larger .\nMarketing:Yeah three quarter of the of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , three quarters . So uh so you don't have to put your {disfmarker} {vocalsound} oh .\nMarketing:Yeah the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh new , blank . So uh when you get {vocalsound} this uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:Ooh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh kinda like this .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or should it be larger ?\nMarketing:Larger I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Larger ? Because you want to put your hands {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But if you pu\nMarketing:Yeah\nUser Interface:Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen .\nIndustrial Designer:You want\nMarketing:becau because you have {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Perhaps that's best .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah okay , true , true , true true .\nIndustrial Designer:Your thumb here .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But not on the screen because {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:that's uh that's an idea .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll {vocalsound} you'll always get some {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You always touch it ,\nIndustrial Designer:You {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Going to be very greasy and stuff .\nMarketing:But it won't get that small because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:One to zero , the two digit , {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah you don't want it too small . How yeah how large {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You have to you have to {disfmarker} Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah they have thick fingers {gap} . But if you wanna make it in international , Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands\nMarketing:Yeah true ,\nIndustrial Designer:and we got these large {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:but {disfmarker} Yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:hey , we we want to do it with our fingers ,\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Your fingers , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Y you could include a pen\nIndustrial Designer:You don't want uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen .\nProject Manager:Yeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that\nMarketing:Yeah {gap} the fingers , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah o yeah {gap} , if they think it's handy to use a pen .\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something .\nProject Manager:And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {gap} You can do {gap} whatever uh any uh cloth .\nMarketing:Yeah but that that can be {gap} with plain soft tissue . Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Okay well\nMarketing:you can buy those at {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision .\nIndustrial Designer:Sure .\nProject Manager:So we can discuss these points . {gap} those points um energy question mark . How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how {disfmarker} are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put {gap} in it . Uh chip on print and case . Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:The docking station .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So that's the the the first point .\nMarketing:Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries\nProject Manager:We already decided that on the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:W {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:which you can recharge through the docking station .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Just like with the telephone .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So if the badg the batteries are dead\nIndustrial Designer:I kinda like your {disfmarker}\nMarketing:then you can re you can uh change them .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah like those .\nIndustrial Designer:Kinda like those kind of batteries .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} but it should be th I think normal batteries ,\nMarketing:Yep . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:not not like two or two uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , normal plain you {disfmarker} No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Simple rechargeable uh batteries .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Um what was with the chip on print ?\nIndustrial Designer:The chip on print ? Um {disfmarker} Uh you gotta f Yeah . I think so . Chip on print with a with a {vocalsound} simple uh a sim not a simple but a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Print plate .\nIndustrial Designer:We also discussed that . Didn't we ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? You still have a print plate .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {gap}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah . You always have a print plate .\nIndustrial Designer:Beg your pardon ?\nMarketing:You always have a print plate ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah sure , of course , yeah .\nMarketing:right ? Always , so {disfmarker} I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .\nProject Manager:Yeah well it's a good question .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It just was in there\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Well uh\nProject Manager:and I didn't have any information about it ,\nIndustrial Designer:chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button .\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the buttons are not always on the same place ,\nMarketing:Yeah , okay . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:so that that's not of any discussion , I think .\nProject Manager:Well you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} I suppose so .\nMarketing:Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah because it has to uh b\nMarketing:Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .\nMarketing:Yeah , okay , true true . True .\nIndustrial Designer:So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And the case , yeah we already discussed the case ,\nUser Interface:It's rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:we wanted to make it from rubber\nUser Interface:Yeah but but a hard rubber like this ?\nIndustrial Designer:and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Or softer rubber or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh hard rubber I think .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's the easy to ha uh to to uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It bounces back from the floor where you {vocalsound} throw it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah sure , look {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:We have different colours .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah yeah this in different colours ?\nIndustrial Designer:D\nMarketing:So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? No I don't think , I think it's more round than square . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah it's a bit . But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .\nMarketing:So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But that's what we want , {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I think so too .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's our target . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's our main target .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Lower than forty years , I think\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ?\nMarketing:it was .\nIndustrial Designer:So i\nMarketing:Oh yeah that that {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} I thought that was a quite good\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Because it\nMarketing:You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:you don't have to put it {disfmarker} get it in your hand , you can put it next to you\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and then dive it in\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's a good idea .\nMarketing:and {gap} . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a lot easier .\nUser Interface:Yeah , alright .\nIndustrial Designer:So , so\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:you got uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Did you write that down ? Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured {vocalsound} remote control . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:You can't you You can't oh , you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , you can uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah but I wrote it down . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's pretty easy but {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And load it on the the user the server .\nProject Manager:What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:You you showed your drawing .\nUser Interface:I had what I just uh I should {gap} again . I miss a few buttons , but . Well . At least uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh {gap} if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah , you have to go back . Yeah uh uh .\nUser Interface:This {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?\nUser Interface:I don't know .\nMarketing:With the minus and the plus .\nUser Interface:I think it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think it's easier than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I don't know . I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but I don't know what they think .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ?\nMarketing:For sound and channel .\nUser Interface:Th\nIndustrial Designer:Depends on the screen . If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . If you make it uh in a rectangle {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Right well if we make it like this , I think if you\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I so it's it's it's it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:put it like this {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Square . {gap}\nMarketing:I think it's it's easier to have it something like {disfmarker} Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Oh , okay .\nMarketing:And on here .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:The other buttons and on here {vocalsound} the top .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here ,\nUser Interface:But I think I wou\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:and the sound .\nUser Interface:I think that's a matter of what you're used to .\nMarketing:Something uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . {gap}\nMarketing:Something like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Sh\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Take your time . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Plus minus plus uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Almost . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah\nMarketing:minus .\nUser Interface:but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus .\nMarketing:Yeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb .\nUser Interface:Yeah but I think {disfmarker} Yeah I don't know . {vocalsound} Perhaps I have some examples .\nIndustrial Designer:W\nUser Interface:I don't know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Who's the usability engineering ?\nUser Interface:That's me .\nMarketing:She is . {gap}\nUser Interface:But I'm going to look if I've got some examples\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh .\nUser Interface:The {disfmarker} 'Cause they can use that better .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Consistency .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Oh {gap} {disfmarker} I have that those s numbers .\nUser Interface:I {disfmarker} Here is our {disfmarker} here are uh\nMarketing:Or a good watch .\nUser Interface:I don't really know .\nMarketing:B\nProject Manager:Everybody's searching in his data .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . Volume selection four times an hour\nUser Interface:Yeah but {gap} {disfmarker} But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So not how much {disfmarker} n not how often it's used , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:W what's what's usual or normal .\nMarketing:Yeah , that depends on on on the remote .\nUser Interface:Yes I'm looking here . But here's it's below ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:here also , and now here's here's next to each other .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:I think it's {gap} it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think {gap} because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it does it doesn't really matter ,\nMarketing:so it depends .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Depends .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down .\nMarketing:Yeah , lower .\nUser Interface:And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:That's how it's is usually {gap} when I look here\nMarketing:True .\nUser Interface:that's what I see .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , um . Let's cut to the chase . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's got to change .\nProject Manager:Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons\nUser Interface:I don't know .\nProject Manager:just the\nMarketing:Yeah is it is user interface .\nProject Manager:concepts .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Component .\nUser Interface:This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , well le Yeah . Interface , yeah .\nUser Interface:And the speech uh shall we implement that ? Or uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer:Technologies , uh .\nMarketing:Yeah I think it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says I'm here .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . But then you should also find a place {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Makes it possible to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . You can talk into the corner .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , a microphone , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Not even necessary ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:because a lotta {disfmarker} you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh {vocalsound} just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote .\nProject Manager:Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh\nUser Interface:Yeah . But {disfmarker} Yeah , that's also {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:over there .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:So , in the middle or something .\nIndustrial Designer:But that's not import I think that's not im very important\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is .\nUser Interface:{gap} but you should uh decide where you want to put it .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah okay , sure , okay ,\nUser Interface:Right ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:well tha\nMarketing:Um I think where it isn't seen\nIndustrial Designer:Underneath ? {gap} Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible .\nMarketing:the most .\nUser Interface:You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Inside .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Well\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah sure , why no\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out\nMarketing:I i between the round of the R_ .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So where do you want to put it ?\nMarketing:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:Well maybe where the one hand {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah actually it does {vocalsound} because it you can you can find it better if you use it .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah\nUser Interface:It's a way for you to uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:bu but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ?\nUser Interface:About a microphone ,\nProject Manager:Yeah because a microphone is very small thing ,\nUser Interface:there is no button .\nProject Manager:but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think the left s under corner should be the best .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Where isn't {disfmarker} i it isn't most in sight .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That doesn't doesn't really matter .\nMarketing:No . Actually doesn't .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So ?\nUser Interface:Alright . Any more uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So well uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Interface type .\nProject Manager:type , supplements , anything . Yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_\nIndustrial Designer:The L_C_D_ yeah ,\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:uh supplements well the supplement is to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap} I think {disfmarker} I thought the , like you said , like scroll {vocalsound} next to the remote isn't that handy .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {gap}\nMarketing:I think it's better to just {gap} up what you'd like to do on the screen . If you want to go back you have to back button go back ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu .\nIndustrial Designer:Hey ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um yeah . Yeah\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:the the young people do like uh scroll uh\nIndustrial Designer:Use the scroll . Yeah I think so too .\nMarketing:Yeah ? You do like it ?\nIndustrial Designer:So why not , on on side .\nUser Interface:Or at least {disfmarker} Yeah I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu {gap} they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Fast , yeah . So if you've got a settings , if you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah I think it is is faster . Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:but if you don't have a lot of option then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But you have {disfmarker} it's f uh\nIndustrial Designer:You have a lot of options ,\nUser Interface:we have five or four or something .\nIndustrial Designer:because when you use {disfmarker} Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen .\nMarketing:Y\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Uh-huh . Yeah , okay , true .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use .\nMarketing:{gap} Okay , no problem .\nProject Manager:And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:which you can touch\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's also different . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well there's our five minutes uh warning . Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ?\nMarketing:Um . No , colours are clear ,\nProject Manager:Everybody think they can can\nMarketing:shape is clear , material is clear .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , what's the standard colour ?\nProject Manager:work for that ?\nMarketing:And a standard ,\nProject Manager:Is there a standard colour ?\nMarketing:yeah we don't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I I\nMarketing:no we have different colour .\nIndustrial Designer:You got you got different colours ,\nMarketing:How many colours are we going to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You should you should have a black one\nIndustrial Designer:but you should have a standard colour .\nUser Interface:because uh I think black is standard .\nMarketing:Black . Yeah , black I think is is the standard .\nIndustrial Designer:Black ? With the with the yellow uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But if you want to be different , then uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Dark grey , something like this this colour or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Just a regular uh remote colour .\nMarketing:Yeah like like yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And then have uh different covers uh to use .\nMarketing:Or or silver . I think it's better to have silver nowadays .\nUser Interface:Silver .\nIndustrial Designer:Silver , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think you see more silver than black .\nIndustrial Designer:You see a lot of t uh silver televisions .\nProject Manager:But still silver and black are {disfmarker} well\nUser Interface:Silver rubber . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah .\nProject Manager:silver is new but also traditional , so uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think we have silver , black and between those {vocalsound} is like I dunno s five colours between them or something .\nProject Manager:Yeah w what about a yellow thing , I mean it\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah y I think it's better to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow , we have .\nProject Manager:could be ugly , but it's definitely fancy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But\nMarketing:R red .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah th yeah . That's right .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy .\nMarketing:Green , wood , brown . Yeah . True .\nIndustrial Designer:When you use titanium , silver is fancy ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . Silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You understand ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , I understand .\nProject Manager:Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah o of course .\nProject Manager:just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , {gap} dark red and brown .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Just all kind of colour .\nIndustrial Designer:Fruity . Fruity loops .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Maroon . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Who's pinging ?\nUser Interface:Is it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You are pingin\nMarketing:No {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} I thought we\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You ping . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , so uh that wraps it up ? Everybody knows uh what to do ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um .\nUser Interface:Well I don't know what to do ,\nIndustrial Designer:Well not what to do . Not what to do .\nUser Interface:but . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . Um here are the individual actions ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board ,\nUser Interface:Ooh . {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing:S\nProject Manager:and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:tough . We'll be available .\nUser Interface:But do we have to {disfmarker} We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes . Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Thin I think we should work {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Okay well that was what I had to say , uh ,\nUser Interface:Yeah I think {gap} .\nProject Manager:final thoughts from anyone , or ?\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:We're finished .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Okay , well thank you very much .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you very much .\nMarketing:Finished .\nUser Interface:So we have to keep talking English now ? {vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "Project Manager began a conceptual design meeting with the group, they discussed the components design, interface design at first. In the presentation, material, colour, type and supplement were referred. Then marketing shared the watch trend over the past and future, and thought young and old people's different tastes should be taken into consideration when designed. After that, the group made a discussion about the remote control concept. The final decision about remote control was made by a round shape and green colour with speech recognition and LCD screen to appeal to the target population.",

Where we uh {disfmarker} We have twenty five minutes for this meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:We uh are to get acquainted . So does everyone want to say who they are ? {gap} that seem sensible ?\nMarketing:Yeah . I'm Robin . I'm the Marketing Manager .\nUser Interface:I'm Louisa . I'm the User Interface Designer .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm Nick . I am the Industrial Designer .\nProject Manager:And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader . {vocalsound} Alright okay , so tool training . Um . {vocalsound} Project plan . So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required ?\nIndustrial Designer:Tool training\nUser Interface:I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training .\nProject Manager:Neither am I {gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh I see , so we shouldn't really be {disfmarker} Oh right okay , so . So we have the project team , which is to um {vocalsound} basically to come up with a new r remote control device .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Uh we have uh {disfmarker} the starting base was the original {vocalsound} which has been in existence now for a period of time . And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to {vocalsound} to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:So um {vocalsound} method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh {vocalsound} the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . So um {vocalsound} in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh this device .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before . And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . Um and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , okay .\nProject Manager:So we've got tool training . Try out whiteboard . Uh . {vocalsound} So we will um .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . So uh I don't know who wishes to go first .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever .\nUser Interface:I don't mind . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I dunno . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:Ah uh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Let's see .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:Good job I got pockets today .\nProject Manager:But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera .\nMarketing:Your microphone's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I take it that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ?\nProject Manager:I would {vocalsound} I would guess so . Or {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:You've lost uh your microphone there .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Technical problems .\nUser Interface:Oh . Right here we go .\nProject Manager:I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay . I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . Little smiley cat there . Um and this would be because they're very independent , uh they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} and they can be very very affectionate . Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats . Um . Um and they can look after themselves .\nProject Manager:{gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Next . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yeah . I'll I'll {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Shall I rub that out , actually ?\nProject Manager:I don't see as there's any need to . There's plenty of space .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:I mean whatever . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:We can have have a whole menagerie . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything . Okay .\nProject Manager:We've had more time to prepare over this side ,\nIndustrial Designer:There's one .\nProject Manager:so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Didn't think of that .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay uh\nProject Manager:The three pens are underneath .\nIndustrial Designer:pens are over here . I'll try the red pen . Okay . Um . {vocalsound} I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm {gap} be able to draw very well ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You get marks for artistic impression . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but I'll have a bash at it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ooh ooh {gap} I lost it there . I think I've just knocked the microphone . {vocalsound} Um .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So you're just doing the face . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear {gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Right . Hello . Um I'm gonna go for the dog , and I'm gonna draw one badly as well . Uh . {gap} looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something .\nUser Interface:That's quite good . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Right . There's my dog . Um {vocalsound} I like dogs because they're very loyal . And they're always happy , so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . And they're also good for exercise as well . You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay , that's why I like dogs .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right , um . {vocalsound} Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh {gap} I'm not too keen on them anyway . Not to worry . So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw . Uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Anyway um . {vocalsound} And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . Other than the fact that they keep dying ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:uh fish are uh {vocalsound} are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Great .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right . Okay , uh if we're still all with us . Right okay , so . Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price . That information has come from our marketing manager here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe . We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit . And therefore making a profit margin of uh {disfmarker} well not actually a profit margin it's uh {disfmarker} because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit . And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:So um {disfmarker} Experience with remote control , first ideas . New remote . So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {gap}\nProject Manager:So uh any any thoughts ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um I {gap} with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . As that is the main function .\nProject Manager:Okay , so so basically we're looking for some um {disfmarker} we're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Um we're looking for a device that is uh {disfmarker} What was the other things you said there ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible .\nProject Manager:Easy to use . Use .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} is easy to use and see .\nProject Manager:And see .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh .\nUser Interface:Can I just check ? {vocalsound} Is this just a television remote ? Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:But it seems to me sensible ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'cause {disfmarker} as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So a device for for all remotes .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Sorry , you go . You go .\nMarketing:I've Okay . Yeah . Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . And um sometimes uh they sort of {disfmarker} remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . So {disfmarker} whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Comes to your whistle . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But is it {disfmarker} in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive . You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And so these are probably mutually exclusive options\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more {gap} with handling them ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ?\nProject Manager:{gap} Better instructions .\nMarketing:Yeah . I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where {disfmarker} you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of {disfmarker} you can link it to that as well , maybe .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting . So uh we have to uh start winding up . Um is there {disfmarker} Next meeting in thirty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So um {disfmarker} Right , so we've got I_D_ the {disfmarker} Come on , where's my {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If you just click return it should be okay . It'll get rid of the message .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Or not . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh there we go .\nMarketing:Oh you've got {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's what I was looking for . Right . So we've got function {disfmarker} Oh what happened to the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think that might be back to the start . Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} slide four {gap}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right . Right . {vocalsound} Sorry about that .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , so we've got um the working design for I_D_ . For U_I_D_ the technical functions design . Marketing , the user requirement specification . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . So . Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay , yes .\nUser Interface:I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control ,\nProject Manager:Television remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:That's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change {vocalsound} where we're going .\nMarketing:Okay cool .\nProject Manager:But at this point in time I think you're right that uh {disfmarker} shall we make it just a T_V_ . Okay ? So we will depart .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We will stay here and uh and break off . And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , that's great .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay cheers .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right s\n",

And uh I want to introduce myself , uh my name is uh Shrida Daseri and uh I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . So I want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here . And what you're uh drawing ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user {disfmarker} usability user interface designer .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} My name is Ed and I do accounting .\nProject Manager:Uh how you spell your name uh ?\nMarketing:E_D_ .\nProject Manager:E_D_ okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:And ?\nIndustrial Designer:Do you also do marketing ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:So only accounting ? Okay .\nMarketing:Accounting , yes .\nProject Manager:And ?\nIndustrial Designer:And I'm Christine ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer .\nProject Manager:Industrial designer .\nIndustrial Designer:But I'm not really one .\nProject Manager:So who is uh marketing , nobody in the market\nMarketing:Marketing is uh , is me {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:It's you , okay . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and uh we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from {disfmarker} with this .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh for the moment not yet .\nProject Manager:Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but uh what's what's your uh {disfmarker} do you have some project plan , something with you or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Good question {vocalsound} . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . We'll have to {disfmarker} simply we'll have to work on it together .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay , so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan , okay , a discussion with uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Certainly by the next meeting .\nProject Manager:By next meeting , okay that will be great . Uh Okay , so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ?\nIndustrial Designer:What is the goal of the project ?\nProject Manager:Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do {vocalsound} . We have to define exactly what our product is , from uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes , so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ?\nMarketing:From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ?\nProject Manager:Oh I think uh , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control .\nUser Interface:Um I was wondering {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Remote controls , 'cause I had two different things . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing:we'll start with the remote control for television then . So we're have to design something that is very user friendly .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . Uh th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:And uh what abo uh Christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um no , I I have not begun working on the design ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor . Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , and um I understood that that was the project goal . So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and um that's about uh that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps .\nProject Manager:So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh for the industrial design ?\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have different choices with different financial models .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , you know um , I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive {disfmarker} that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . So it would {disfmarker} really would need to um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so um d uh you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool .\nProject Manager:Okay , but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but uh I need something in the writing , so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you . Okay , and it's po\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And when would you like that ?\nProject Manager:B as soon as possible .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a {disfmarker} is close enough ?\nProject Manager:Yes I think uh that would be good , because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because uh without any uh documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {vocalsound} are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ?\nProject Manager:Yes , of course , if you need some help , uh so let me know . So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , I'll get back to you on that .\nProject Manager:Yes . Thank you . Okay . And uh Ed uh so what's {disfmarker} what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ?\nMarketing:Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh {disfmarker} the competition ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:uh th I agree it has to be something {disfmarker} it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use .\nProject Manager:Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because uh she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so because you need to sell {disfmarker} and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the {disfmarker} your sales plan , okay , th\nMarketing:Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for ,\nProject Manager:Th That {disfmarker} that's\nMarketing:that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , that's {disfmarker} you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you {disfmarker} uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Very good .\nProject Manager:Okay , I can coordinate ,\nMarketing:Very good .\nProject Manager:or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Between uh all the coor\nUser Interface:Well , no , not exactly . I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work ,\nProject Manager:Th Christine , yeah {vocalsound} . Which is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:and so it's sort of {disfmarker} it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it .\nProject Manager:Yes . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:then you will {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Which will also feed into the marketing ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .\nProject Manager:Yes . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . Um , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account .\nProject Manager:Yep . But what I request , okay , {gap} keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening .\nUser Interface:Yeah , of course {vocalsound} . Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around .\nProject Manager:Yes . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management .\nUser Interface:Sure . No problem .\nProject Manager:So any questions for uh time being ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so then we can discuss about uh further things . So , we'll meet when the {disfmarker} we'll discuss on the further meeting .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's okay ? Thanks for coming .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ?\nProject Manager:Yes , I will . Yes .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , yeah , that would be useful .\nProject Manager:I'll copy , uh le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ?\nUser Interface:Sure .\nProject Manager:And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or uh just come and uh knock my door , okay , so I'm available here . It's good ? Okay , thanks for coming and uh I wish you a nice time then .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nUser Interface:Thanks .\nProject Manager:Okay , see you later .

It's the final design , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay just one {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} S so so I discussed with Guillaume .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Right . {vocalsound} And uh {vocalsound} so we have {vocalsound} {disfmarker} and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or {gap} control module . And detachable big buttons for all people um . So {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes {vocalsound} . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function .\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the {vocalsound} for the speech recognition system here .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And here the the switch that control if you want {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Why you why you you put it in the the side ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well I I I think uh it's the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's not a good place maybe {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well so it's a microphone array .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh it's very costly , microphone array {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it's just a single microphone , and you {disfmarker} I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound} yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .\nProject Manager:How much does it cost this one ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars\nUser Interface:For the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Fifteen dollars ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} fifteen dollars ,\nProject Manager:Ah it's above it's above the budget .\nIndustrial Designer:but uh well it's not it's not uh {disfmarker} yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh {disfmarker} voila .\nMarketing:The cost would be le reduced .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah the {gap} and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . {gap}\nUser Interface:Mm . Hmm .\nProject Manager:How many b battery is there ?\nIndustrial Designer:How many , excuse me ?\nProject Manager:Battery .\nIndustrial Designer:Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:A_A_ rechargeable batteries .\nIndustrial Designer:Rechargeable of course ,\nUser Interface:Yeah rechargeable batteries .\nIndustrial Designer:because we have the charger .\nUser Interface:We have the charger so it's no problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and you just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So one one battery ?\nIndustrial Designer:On uh yeah one battery .\nMarketing:Is that two or one ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's kinetic reserve .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Actually uh it's a flexible thing .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You just n uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Now what is the whole day rating for that ?\nIndustrial Designer:The {disfmarker} excuse me ?\nMarketing:Whole day's rating .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What type of battery ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:if you uh like it's exist .\nMarketing:Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} At uh {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Then the next time you pick it , oh\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it works {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah just explain the button uh Norman .\nUser Interface:yeah alright . This button is like the mouse {disfmarker} is like a joystick ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it {disfmarker} the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is {gap} getting destroyed .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:If you\nUser Interface:Uh okay this is new prototype uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So basically th it's the same uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh-huh and also the switch .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No four dollars , it's {vocalsound} {gap} good . {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger ,\nUser Interface:Oh no\nMarketing:because that's a major that's a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:th actually th we'll come to that point in our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:and if you disable speech recognition system then ?\nUser Interface:W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} so Norman will explain to you {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm .\nProject Manager:And we will we will serve the charger with this ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah of course mm {gap} .\nUser Interface:Th they {vocalsound} either these with the {disfmarker} uh the the charger any\nProject Manager:With the remote control .\nUser Interface:in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay so the price of the charger included in the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Thank thank you {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And so mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The price should be below twelve and a half Euro .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah\nProject Manager:Well that's {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to {disfmarker} people are willing to pay more for good design .\nProject Manager:We have we have just {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah people are willing to pay more ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .\nProject Manager:The price of selling is twenty five Euros .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And the price of production {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Or uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so is uh modular .\nProject Manager:That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah ,\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it {disfmarker} put it back in , or you can use the other one ,\nMarketing:Something like customised . Yeah\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:or {vocalsound} the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You want a microphone to put in the {vocalsound} speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm hmm hmm hmm .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Hmm okay .\nUser Interface:It's pretty flexible in the yeah price {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh yeah yeah you should present that .\nIndustrial Designer:that that you ca you can add up {vocalsound} to the {disfmarker} to your remote control\nMarketing:And this is other one ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up {disfmarker} they come up with their modules ,\nMarketing:Mm hmm hmm hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:they just plug in it\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and they can have all the control they want here .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled ,\nUser Interface:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and it acts like the previous one ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you just plug in and it works .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with {vocalsound} the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here {disfmarker} oop {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:it's very robust {gap} , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ?\nIndustrial Designer:The titanium\nProject Manager:Titanium .\nIndustrial Designer:and so it's very uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .\nMarketing:Yeah that's fine .\nUser Interface:Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ {vocalsound} and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the {disfmarker} or is it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:that's the reminder part . Yeah and um {disfmarker} And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define\nMarketing:Mm hmm hmm hmm .\nUser Interface:so {disfmarker} sorry ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a {gap} of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And {vocalsound} and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from {disfmarker} yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:And also like the {gap} and the fancy designs yeah .\nProject Manager:What what's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Maybe we can improve more on the design but {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What's the price to p to produce ?\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} uh this is the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well so the price to produce {disfmarker} For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .\nProject Manager:With with with the charge ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's about it {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} without without the charger\nMarketing:With the charger ?\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ {vocalsound} , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:We don't have charger . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think we can use Excel {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's about {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We don't have all the options {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .\nProject Manager:Charger we don't have charger here either .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:No it's\nIndustrial Designer:But it's just if you want all functionalities .\nProject Manager:it's below the the the budget .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Excuse me ?\nProject Manager:It's below the bu the budget .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah it's a nice input\nProject Manager:We {disfmarker}\nMarketing:but we have an other inputs from the l public demands .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think we can just go to my presentation then . We can wind up . Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is {disfmarker} first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm .\nMarketing:And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .\nMarketing:Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find {disfmarker} these are the latest fashion updates , and so this {disfmarker} in Paris and Milan {gap} they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .\nUser Interface:Spongy spongy . Mm mm .\nMarketing:So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes .\nUser Interface:Mm {vocalsound} mm .\nMarketing:And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .\nUser Interface:But the the problem is that uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} is it robust to mishandling ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:We have {disfmarker} you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:A sponge . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah so uh {vocalsound} so finally we have these three criterias .\nUser Interface:Spongy {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these ,\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:so on this scale , if it is true , if it is {disfmarker} if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't {disfmarker} it looks uh {disfmarker} it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We can make our study on this and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ?\nMarketing:No no we have {disfmarker} you have designed two products now ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?\nProject Manager:You .\nMarketing:According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel {disfmarker} does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look {disfmarker} how does it look ?\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm .\nMarketing:D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four .\nMarketing:And you both agree for that ?\nProject Manager:And you ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think we can improve on the design .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh {gap} {vocalsound} design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . It's it it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um we have been focused all all this {vocalsound} time on the {vocalsound} on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .\nIndustrial Designer:Technical aspects .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:So I take three on {disfmarker} with L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah a three .\nMarketing:So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated\nMarketing:Four .\nIndustrial Designer:so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Well it's it's the same for both so {vocalsound} I will give a five , six . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Five with L_C_D_ and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well five also uh {disfmarker} Norman please . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um {vocalsound} the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now {disfmarker} and another innovation we have is simplicity and {disfmarker} simplicity , few buttons , we've uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} A lot of functionalities .\nIndustrial Designer:With lot of functionalities .\nUser Interface:So that is uh that is uh for both th\nMarketing:So without L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface:Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all {disfmarker} well this is a biased judgement {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:because we designed them .\nMarketing:No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the innovation is v is very high I think .\nProject Manager:For L_C_D_ .\nMarketing:With L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:Both .\nMarketing:And without L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm for both it's the the same innovations .\nUser Interface:For both . It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} six , let's go for six .\nProject Manager:Without L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:Both .\nMarketing:No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I {disfmarker} there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh no innovative yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?\nMarketing:So we can't go {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Talk about {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We haven't really uh determined {vocalsound} what are {disfmarker} actually actually\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No it's like this ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme .\nProject Manager:So let's remove it .\nUser Interface:Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .\nMarketing:Uh then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yes exactly .\nProject Manager:This is the problem .\nMarketing:No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .\nIndustrial Designer:If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n\nMarketing:L_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a\nUser Interface:But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .\nMarketing:I mean that depends upon your design , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ {vocalsound} we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ ,\nMarketing:I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:we give what the customer uh wants , right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which {gap} do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons ,\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so I will give a six for the easy to use .\nUser Interface:Yeah I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:sorry . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's cheaper to produce .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} S {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And uh if the the {disfmarker} well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah that's right .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the {gap} s similarit for the old people they want simplicity ,\nMarketing:Yeah yeah that's right .\nUser Interface:so that's why {vocalsound} we have the parental module . Uh we can ha have {disfmarker} build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um {disfmarker} we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . User customisation is very important yeah . Yeah\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Six .\nMarketing:So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:W uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Or you want it to be six ?\nUser Interface:I think it's the same .\nIndustrial Designer:Um six .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes as you say , with better uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Without L_C_D_ .\nMarketing:S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} yeah . And to improve the the look .\nMarketing:As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:and it's going to be much simpler to use .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so let's go back to our laboratory and {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} To improve on the design .\nProject Manager:What a what what about the sys speech recognition ?\nMarketing:So .\nProject Manager:{gap} what about the integration of speech recognition ?\nUser Interface:Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . Right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:That's going to be an optional .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ah so it's optional with the {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing:It's an optional .\nIndustrial Designer:It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more {vocalsound} likes more to have a spongy uh {vocalsound} remote control than {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think it will be {disfmarker} I think i\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module\nProject Manager:Yeah . Or ma yeah .\nMarketing:and so that their parents can't use it {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:so mayb better if you have all this in the same {disfmarker}\nMarketing:In the same set , yeah ,\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:and and individual buttons to make them work .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know ,\nProject Manager:So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional {disfmarker} uh will be optional .\nUser Interface:what do you think uh ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple {disfmarker} or how many couples have a T_V_\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:or to the number or singles who have a television .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So based on that I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think it inc increase . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well you can {gap} {disfmarker} if you had uh something li\nProject Manager:I think it i increases .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh no ,\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:because if you if you add uh something {disfmarker} well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah yeah\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the {vocalsound} functionalities um on the same module , but uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing:On the same P_C_B_\nUser Interface:Well well the other aspect is that if {vocalsound} in the {disfmarker} when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the {disfmarker} you're gonna keep the same customer ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .\nMarketing:Yeah that's right .\nUser Interface:So so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean you could just provide with an optional {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So it's something like a Microsoft product {vocalsound} update .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And and we we we we we we don't want that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m {gap}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Updates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be {disfmarker} can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , it depends on the v production . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah\nMarketing:Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think we are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um {disfmarker} but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Or uh it could be like this {disfmarker} the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh well but it's a bit complicated to {disfmarker} if if if you need machines to {disfmarker} different machines to um ah well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . What we can change is to propose the {vocalsound} customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah that's right .\nUser Interface:and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah that's right .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ?\nIndustrial Designer:Sponge . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think you need to look into the material .\nUser Interface:Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .\nProject Manager:{gap} Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . I don't know , we have to ask these question . We have to give answers so {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} I suppose that you {gap} this criteria , is it ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Project evaluation . {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Room for creativity . This room is a bit small , but {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} but I think it's okay for us to work with . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I feel it's fine , we know we don't need uh {disfmarker} I think it's okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah mm .\nIndustrial Designer:That was good .\nMarketing:This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:And the leadership was excellent .\nProject Manager:Yeah I think so {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Good job {vocalsound} good job .\nIndustrial Designer:Fine yes uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah that's right . Yeah that's right .\nProject Manager:Uh the teamwork was very very good . I was really {disfmarker} I am very satisfying to work with with you .\nIndustrial Designer:Very democratic .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Thank you {gap} {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nMarketing:And new ideas found . Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ?\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Come up with new product {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Less fancy .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I mean uh what type of product would you think {disfmarker} could we make this more interesting ?\nUser Interface:Mm we {disfmarker} I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and also more well uh {vocalsound} more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . We achieved uh project goal I think .\nMarketing:Yeah\nProject Manager:De\nMarketing:that is within the budget .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's w yes , more or less .\nMarketing:And the evaluation was {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple .\nMarketing:Yeah that's right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright . So .\nMarketing:And the next is celebration .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh coffee machine .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah {vocalsound} free free coffee\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Alright then , we finished ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah thank you for your work and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah thank you , thank you very much .\nUser Interface:Thank you very much .\n",
        "summary": "Industrial Designer and User Interface gave a presentation about two versions of the prototype, one with and one without LCD. They both had a speech recognition system, microphone, a few number of buttons, rechargeable batteries and different modules. The prototype with LCD was too expensive, while the other one was quite cheap. Marketing made evaluation criteria. The scale included fancy look and feel, innovativeness and easy to use. Then Marketing asked Industrial Designer and User Interface to give scores towards two versions of the prototype according to the scale. Both Industrial Designer and User Interface gave average points to look and feel, high points to innovativeness and to easy to use. At the end of the meeting, group members did project evaluation. They felt good about leadership and teamwork.",

So {disfmarker} Oh , good morning everyone .\nUser Interface:Good morning .\nIndustrial Designer:Good morning .\nProject Manager:I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . I've prepared a little presentation . My name is {gap} and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you {gap} on what actually is the project . This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . Um this is the opening , then we will get {disfmarker} {gap} I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . We'll do a little tool training with these two things . We'll take a look at the project plan . Uh there will be time for discussion . Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . And then we will close this session . Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . Um there are cameras\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a a set of microphones\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and there are microphones here also . But please uh don't be afraid of them .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:They won't hurt you . Um well uh\nUser Interface:Well {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . Let's start with the ladies {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Well uh I'm uh {gap} and my uh function is User Interface Design , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So uh that's me .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , uh I'm {gap} uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh {disfmarker} look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project .\nProject Manager:Okay , so I .\nUser Interface:Me too .\nMarketing:My name's {gap} . I'm uh {vocalsound} Marketing Expert . {vocalsound} My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other .\nProject Manager:Okay , well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's good . Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a {disfmarker} to design a new remote control which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . {vocalsound} And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project {disfmarker} such a product . Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . Okay . But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things . They are smart boards . As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . And uh this one here is a white board . I will uh instruct you about that soon . Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything's okay ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nProject Manager:As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . Um does everyone understand this\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So we can't erase anything .\nProject Manager:nice application ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Well you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:S\nProject Manager:I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nProject Manager:But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages . And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . Well I'm not very good at drawing , but I will uh go first and um try to draw {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Good .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:{gap} No .\nUser Interface:It's a sheep . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Dinos\nIndustrial Designer:Seal , a seal . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Dinosaur .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Beaver .\nUser Interface:{gap} A beaver . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:A be {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well it uh\nUser Interface:It's weird . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:could be everything .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . With a tail and a mouth .\nProject Manager:Maybe when I put on\nUser Interface:It has wings ?\nMarketing:Turtle .\nProject Manager:this thing it could be a turtle , or a snail ,\nIndustrial Designer:Snail . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well the snail doesn't have legs .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:But a turtle has . And those are slow . And I hope our project group will not be slow ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but we will uh work to a good result\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and do it uh as fast as we can . Okay , time for another animal . Would you like to go next ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No problem . No problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Sure .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh right .\nMarketing:Mm . It was four months ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Nice , okay .\nUser Interface:Well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} The hell .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} To make it a little bit easier . {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's a giraffe .\nIndustrial Designer:Make that cute . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Or a dinosaur . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No , it's a giraffe . 'Kay .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:I think it's easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe .\nUser Interface:Yes . Giraffe .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , {vocalsound} it can reach everything . And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . So that's my favourite animal .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Anything else you need to know ?\nProject Manager:Could you write the words , uh underneath it ? Or more words .\nMarketing:Oh , uh {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Tall . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Tall . So ,\nUser Interface:Should I uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'kay .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:So I can draw , but uh {disfmarker} Uh . Well . {vocalsound} Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:B {vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's a mouse .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Bunny rabbit . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:A bunny rabbit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} Oh wrong one . Uh . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well uh\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:you can guess what it is , I hope . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh-huh . No problem .\nProject Manager:Little rabbits .\nUser Interface:It's a rabbit .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And uh well uh it's uh quick , I guess . That's uh my uh favourite animal . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:And our final drawing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Bob Ross .\nUser Interface:A dolphin . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay , um .\nMarketing:Dolphin .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:One of the most intelligent uh\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:animals in our world .\nUser Interface:Well .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah intelligent .\nUser Interface:With an E_ .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I've I've uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Eraser .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You can try out the eraser now . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Pen . Well not perfect , but okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , well\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:thank you very much . I can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Not really . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:huh ? Well , nice animals , nice words . Sounds good . Um back to business , back to the money part . Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you . What's your experience with remote control ?\nUser Interface:{gap} I always lose them .\nIndustrial Designer:A lot of buttons . And you always lose them .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:A lot of buttons which you don't use\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:or who you don't use\nMarketing:Complex .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Complex .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Not user friendly .\nUser Interface:{gap} search for the buttons , which one is which\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Boring .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Boring , it's not fun to use a remote .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Black , all black .\nUser Interface:Well .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Black colours .\nMarketing:So , yeah .\nProject Manager:Well maybe we should try to make it fun .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} They use batteries and {gap} batteries uh and poor signal .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls .\nMarketing:The the angle you have to use . You had different remote controls for different devices .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , different remote controls ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:perhaps you can integrate them or something .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh for the use of different uh devices {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Your stereo and your T_V_\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:and uh . Perhaps that's an idea .\nMarketing:Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's right . And which you don't use .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nMarketing:so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but you could uh I thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection\nMarketing:Flap\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em .\nMarketing:yeah . Yeah , okay , that's possible ,\nIndustrial Designer:That's possible , so that you only get the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:but it'll get very big the the remote control .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . You should just give it to {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No n n no , just {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um {vocalsound} the usual buttons such as uh um {vocalsound} zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Changing channel .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Or uh {vocalsound} the numbers , of course .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {gap} numbers .\nIndustrial Designer:But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television .\nMarketing:On and off .\nIndustrial Designer:You only use those uh the first time , or .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:So . Uh .\nMarketing:play , pause , stop .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think so , yeah .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:Yes . But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , {vocalsound} w\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , of course .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , uh teletext .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:what's the name ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} think so .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:so they don't have to get out of their seat .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Because I think a market will be all kind of people . Elderly p el elderly , young people , so .\nUser Interface:But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in {disfmarker} think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:that uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I I understand .\nMarketing:Yeah I think that's the better one ,\nUser Interface:And the B_B_C_ {gap} .\nMarketing:because {disfmarker} I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No .\nUser Interface:Yes {gap} . Yeah , I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though .\nMarketing:I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , we can leave that {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:When I think of it uh\nMarketing:Not that much .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly . So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm . Standard deliver .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:it only has to have uh the most used buttons . You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television .\nUser Interface:Well\nIndustrial Designer:In those {disfmarker} in that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but\nMarketing:No but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah , th it {vocalsound} it's {disfmarker} I think that's not {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That's not {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but I {disfmarker} but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference {disfmarker} different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's right .\nMarketing:Yeah , okay {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for {disfmarker} to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:Yeah that's uh {gap} .\nMarketing:I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control .\nUser Interface:Well not everywhere .\nMarketing:So {gap} I think numerals .\nIndustrial Designer:Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television .\nMarketing:Yeah , but then you have to choose the {disfmarker} always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code .\nUser Interface:Yeah , you can choose the code {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay ,\nMarketing:You can use which which type of television you have . That's no problem . But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:but {vocalsound} uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because {vocalsound} because uh the first {disfmarker} they lost the one they lost first one\nMarketing:Simplicity .\nIndustrial Designer:or the first one is broken ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television ,\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so that option is not {vocalsound} uh optional for those uh people .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah g available .\nUser Interface:But the people have a new television ,\nMarketing:True .\nUser Interface:and c if you look into the future , then they want {disfmarker} will want the button , if their thing is broke .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So we should take that in consideration .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay , well\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:any more ideas ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh mm , no .\nProject Manager:No ?\nUser Interface:Guess not .\nMarketing:Of course .\nIndustrial Designer:Things'll come up .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah well we have some time . Let's see what more I have to tell you . I don't think there is much left . Nope . We're starting to close . Um our next meeting uh will start {disfmarker} well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions . Um , as you can see , the different roles have uh different tasks . And there's a ping .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Is it my laptop ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Stop the meeting now {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Ah well\nUser Interface:Yeah meeting will close in five minutes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that's good , five minutes and uh the meeting's over , uh right on schedule .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design . And this was the Interface Designer ? Or the Interaction Designer .\nUser Interface:Hmm hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Or what was it , I_D_ ?\nUser Interface:No interface .\nIndustrial Designer:No ?\nMarketing:Interface .\nProject Manager:Interface Designer , okay , first guess was right . Uh will take a look at the the working design .\nIndustrial Designer:No ,\nUser Interface:No\nIndustrial Designer:the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design ,\nUser Interface:the {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and the in uh usability interaction {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Industrial Designer , okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay . {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:sorry . {vocalsound} Let's just use the acronyms . Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , or uh , or how {disfmarker} I don't really {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly , I hope . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Right . Alright . {vocalsound} Me too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And of course you have your own uh expertise .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well uh that was what I had to say .\nMarketing:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:Uh are there any more questions ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:No ? Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:I have one question .\nProject Manager:Okay , one question ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nMarketing:Where does it says we have to make a remote , because I presumed {disfmarker} {gap} She didn't know who . Okay , no {vocalsound} , no problem .\nProject Manager:Okay\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} No problem . Okay .\nProject Manager:we're still going {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No problem . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes , then .\nIndustrial Designer:Alrighty . Okay .\nProject Manager:Thank you very much .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "A new remote control project was introduced by Project Manager. Members made self-introductions and began to know each other by guessing animals others drew. Project manager said that the remote control would be sold at 25 Euros and a production cost of 12.5 Euros. Project Manager also hoped to achieve fifty million Euros and international market by new remote control. Then the team discussed the disadvantages of the remote control and designed a new remote control style. Industrial Designer made a desire to design a remote control that can be used in different devices with most used buttons. Project Manager agreed that rather than complicated buttons, friendly to users and minimalist design with necessary buttons would be better.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Hi Kate . {vocalsound} Okay , carry on .\nIndustrial Designer:Just just carry on . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have {disfmarker} the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , {vocalsound} um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay . {vocalsound} Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting {disfmarker} the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of {disfmarker} going after {disfmarker} going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for {disfmarker} be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um {vocalsound} the corporate image . So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . {vocalsound} Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right . So we're ready to close that and go back to our {disfmarker} That one . Right . We're up to the point of the {disfmarker} Go back . Um {vocalsound} the three presentations . So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . Is that okay ? Is that alright with everybody else ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Especially since Kate asked to be last . {vocalsound} Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or {vocalsound} S_A_R_H_ .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I respond to either .\nProject Manager:You respond to whatever you get , huh ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No worries .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um , did you do your {disfmarker} Hit {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , {gap}\nProject Manager:Ah , there it is . Ta-da .\nMarketing:Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:But I'm going to move on to more interesting um {vocalsound} more vibrant things . {vocalsound} So , I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh {disfmarker} the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . What's hot , fruit and veg . Spongy .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:This is really interesting change from past years ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . {vocalsound} And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . So . {vocalsound} I also did a little research on um {vocalsound} what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . Fancy . Functional is out . And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , {vocalsound} you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically {vocalsound} superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . Ease of use . Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of {vocalsound} fruit {vocalsound} fruit themed sleeves .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think that's a good idea . Don't you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Y yeah , you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Exactly . {vocalsound} Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . {gap} you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:They could be {disfmarker} ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . Um it could actually {disfmarker} the sleeve could {vocalsound} take up a lot of the {vocalsound} development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . So what we're talking about is changing . this concept . Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's what's hot on the catwalks . {vocalsound} So , this is my {disfmarker} This is what I'm thinking .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh mm . In most families , don't {disfmarker} isn't the remote {disfmarker} is a remote .\nMarketing:Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it {disfmarker} we all need a remote ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the {disfmarker} someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . W and {vocalsound} plus I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm . Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:and they would have a remote for each one ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so .\nMarketing:Yeah . So this is an idea and I I {disfmarker} you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This {vocalsound} spongy fruit and veg .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .\nMarketing:Thanks . {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid .\nUser Interface:Yep . {vocalsound} And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components .\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I I just have my ear to the market , guys . {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Is this {gap} to the market {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,\nMarketing:Is spongiest , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:That would add {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I was thinking titanium myself .\nUser Interface:I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just {disfmarker} I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they're also minimalist and shiny .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . I think many of us would associate those with fancy . Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . We could call it uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The name .\nProject Manager:Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management\nUser Interface:Yeah , but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ?\nProject Manager:and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That , you know , that might be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Let's delegate . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Wo would that be agreeable ?\nMarketing:And then we could keep it titanium .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um {disfmarker} maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , maybe . Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ?\nUser Interface:I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .\nProject Manager:Okay , we'll move the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} You can even have them in different flavours as well . {vocalsound} So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Or s or smelly . Scratchy\nUser Interface:yeah . Scratch and sniff . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right , well\nMarketing:It's hot on the streets , guys .\nIndustrial Designer:I I I think some of this um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . {vocalsound} So um I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . I really need a pen or something but uh {disfmarker} does my mouse work ? No . Um {disfmarker} oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ?\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . This is this is the a a {vocalsound} a remote that's been opened up\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and that's the the back of the interface . And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . Um {vocalsound} and we {disfmarker} that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um {vocalsound} uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um {vocalsound} doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . {vocalsound} So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . We can have a hand {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sorry {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} A wind-up .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:a wind-up , yeah , {vocalsound} which I think is quite an interesting concept for a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sorry {disfmarker} for a remote control ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but i it maybe is {disfmarker} doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Remember , we only have forty minutes\nIndustrial Designer:where um {vocalsound} you you actually get the energy by moving the device ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . You have to {disfmarker} it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Or we we had talked about solar power ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , {vocalsound} or titanium .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um {vocalsound} I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , what does the interface look like ? Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . {vocalsound} Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . {vocalsound} Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it {disfmarker} the technology is there . And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it {disfmarker} that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker} well I I think we've got two options . We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which {vocalsound} means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that {vocalsound} may or may not be a good thing .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sorry . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . {vocalsound} So , thank you .\nMarketing:That sounds good . Any idea {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nMarketing:Um do you have any idea if if this could {disfmarker} if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'm afraid I don't have that information available . Um manufacturing didn't actually give {disfmarker} attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Hmm . Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . But I think the important thing might be to choose one .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah mm-hmm .\nMarketing:You know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry .\nUser Interface:Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company ,\nMarketing:That's uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Banana ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Alright , well let's see then .\nUser Interface:But um I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .\nMarketing:Yeah . But {disfmarker} yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one ,\nMarketing:I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit .\nIndustrial Designer:which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:we can't do anything fancier .\nUser Interface:Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what {disfmarker} well , {vocalsound} my extensive presentation {vocalsound} on what sort of interfaces are available .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Mm . Thank you , Kate .\nProject Manager:Thank you , Kate .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . So {vocalsound} so mine's a bit pointless . Right . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ?\nProject Manager:Yes . There we go .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I don't have it on mine though .\nMarketing:Oh I think um Florence resolved it by\nIndustrial Designer:I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's {disfmarker} it'll {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Do it again .\nMarketing:F_ eight again .\nProject Manager:Keep doing it until you get it in both {disfmarker} you get it there , you get it yours without that one ,\nIndustrial Designer:I think it {disfmarker} yeah , you you will do an {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and then you get it with both .\nUser Interface:Should I do it again ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This time it should come up both .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Right then . I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . {vocalsound} Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , which {disfmarker} Well , I couldn't find a {disfmarker} the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:So I was thinking that uh {vocalsound} um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do {disfmarker} you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . So\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , {vocalsound} just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .\nUser Interface:And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic .\nIndustrial Designer:It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh {vocalsound} then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause um {vocalsound} otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting {disfmarker} building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well .\nUser Interface:And it's a little bit pointless as well I think .\nIndustrial Designer:There is that .\nUser Interface:Like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy ,\nMarketing:It's a duplication .\nUser Interface:just a little menu showing {disfmarker} yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer . {vocalsound} Um . But as for actually arranging them {disfmarker} let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?\nUser Interface:I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I can't quite d uh describe it . {gap} you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . Yeah , see where the mouse is ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface:so you pick your menu and then {disfmarker} your different options and when when you click on each one , it {disfmarker} you can go into a new menu for that . I'm getting a bit uh specific here .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:Really we'd have to use something to show you ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I think I think that's a g nice clean design ,\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} To uh m make it .\nUser Interface:If {disfmarker} I don't think I can get it up on the screen . Ah here we go . Right .\nMarketing:Oh nice .\nUser Interface:Well ,\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker} Hmm .\nUser Interface:the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated .\nProject Manager:Huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . What else have we got ?\nMarketing:Mm . Wow .\nUser Interface:Them , they're terrible . But they all have this this feature of this uh {disfmarker} It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle ,\nProject Manager:It's a selection wheel .\nUser Interface:which I think is a really good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .\nUser Interface:Yeah , like up , down , left and right . Which is good . And then and then {disfmarker} Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , {vocalsound} uh and then also {vocalsound} when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:And that's it .\nIndustrial Designer:In fact {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Look at look at this one .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh that's really nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Do you think with um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Might take up your whole living room .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the {disfmarker} something reminiscent of the child's remote . Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . You know ,\nUser Interface:Possibly .\nMarketing:we could call {vocalsound} like a fruit name ,\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:but it would be a little more abstract .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather {disfmarker} if you feel {disfmarker} if you like the spongy {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That also is possible .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I'm just just throwing out ideas .\nProject Manager:Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah . I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? This is actually the volume up and down ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but {vocalsound} they both say V_ on them ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:which , when you first look at it , {vocalsound} you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Nice . Good point .\nUser Interface:But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:But then , that's complicated .\nProject Manager:I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . So {vocalsound} let's {disfmarker} Mm . Right . They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which {disfmarker} the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The {disfmarker} You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic ,\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost .\nProject Manager:What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?\nMarketing:I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , you don't even notice um that it's there .\nUser Interface:It sounds great . I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:It could tie in with the fanciful design\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:as uh , you know , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought ,\nMarketing:throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving .\nUser Interface:isn't it ? It's like {disfmarker} yeah ,\nProject Manager:So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible .\nUser Interface:a good selling point .\nMarketing:Be\nUser Interface:But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .\nProject Manager:It costs . {vocalsound} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And and how much you do have to keep it moving ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity .\nMarketing:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:But I could market that as a um as a {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:True , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . You know ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:kind of the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh right , okay ,\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision .\nIndustrial Designer:I'd {disfmarker} that that's something I maybe should have covered . Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What about the ca\nIndustrial Designer:I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built\nProject Manager:yeah . Oh , the way we {gap} uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper .\nProject Manager:Oh , okay . Um what about the case ? I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and I think we've discussed not having titanium . One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:What about you ?\nUser Interface:Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover ,\nMarketing:Mm . Kind of like an internal egg .\nProject Manager:Cover .\nUser Interface:so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Plastic inside .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac\nIndustrial Designer:I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh {disfmarker} sounds like a nice idea if it is .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And with sports on television .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um the next part they want is the user interface concept .\nIndustrial Designer:I should I should r {gap}\nMarketing:I su\nProject Manager:I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to {vocalsound} finish with .\nMarketing:Then I'll just say I support either {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .\nProject Manager:Okay , and it says interface . What type and what supplements ?\nUser Interface:Just copy the one on the left . {vocalsound} No um a scroll {disfmarker} Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .\nIndustrial Designer:Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:that brings the cost down quite a lot\nUser Interface:I'd {disfmarker} like push buttons with {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on .\nUser Interface:So push buttons {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , um {vocalsound} that's that . Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation .\nUser Interface:No , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually .\nMarketing:No we can't , actually .\nProject Manager:Oh . Oh my , I'm sorry .\nMarketing:That's why I was looking over your shoulder\nProject Manager:Oh , okay . Sorry about that . missed that one . This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . Ah , ta-da .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Now it's gone again .\nProject Manager:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:You know , I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , because I can't even see mine . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes ,\nUser Interface:Oh yes .\nProject Manager:these are {vocalsound} the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product {vocalsound} evaluation . Um the two of you {vocalsound} get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype .\nUser Interface:Great .\nProject Manager:Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way .\nMarketing:Sounds good .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Anything else we need to do ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I don't think so .\nProject Manager:Go to it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Play-Doh .\nProject Manager:And that's the end of this meeting . That's for her benefit . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's really all I got , guys .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "This meeting was a conceptual design meeting. In this meeting, the group mainly discussed the component, energy source, buttons, colours and styles of the remote control. They decided to use the kinetic as the energy source because of its convenience, light weight, fancy design and the good selling point of the environment, but they still needed more cost research. They also reached a final consensus to apply a hard plastic inner shell with a spongy plastic for the component, and push buttons for the type of interface due to their common features of convenience and user-friendliness.",

I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I've always wanted one of these , I really have . {vocalsound} Where do you buy 'em from ? {vocalsound} They're {gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Right . Hello everybody .\nUser Interface:Hello .\nProject Manager:Back again for another wonderful meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Is uh everyone ready ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Almost . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh my gosh . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay .\nProject Manager:Are you ready ? Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um {vocalsound} which was we got together just to basically decide on {disfmarker} well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . {vocalsound} Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .\nUser Interface:Hmm . {vocalsound} Do you have any preference uh of order ?\nProject Manager:Um I'd like to um hear\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want {disfmarker} what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Batteries .\nUser Interface:I think she is still finishing her {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing .\nProject Manager:It's just that {disfmarker} yeah , let's let's hear from you first .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Where is that thing ?\nUser Interface:Okay , it's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's here .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh sorry , couldn't see .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Would that work ?\nProject Manager:Get yourself in position . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay , so that's me again .\nMarketing:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is {disfmarker} which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of {disfmarker} which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v\nProject Manager:I don't think any of us remember the fifties .\nUser Interface:Is it like a crank thing or something {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that {disfmarker} it will give it the energy to work .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with {disfmarker} but also using some solar power .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Do {gap} sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Does anybody know ?\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno actually .\nUser Interface:Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno . Um . Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that .\nProject Manager:Mm . Okay , jolly good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What's a double curved one ?\nIndustrial Designer:You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where {disfmarker} for example titanium , you can't use it for {disfmarker} if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So that might be an idea of using the rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but then it should , you know {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Let's have a squeezable remote . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe ,\nProject Manager:{gap} when a T_V_ programme's got one {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:watching the match and {gap} your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I like that idea .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So rubber would be {disfmarker} Okay .\nMarketing:I think rubber's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Rubber , we're all we're all going {disfmarker} we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ?\nMarketing:But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh s so if d\nMarketing:People . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:okay . And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . Um scroll buttons , as well .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .\nProject Manager:Well , we're gonna go with {gap} I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So it's a constraint . Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? {vocalsound} If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . If that makes sense .\nProject Manager:{gap} push buttons instead of the wheel ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {gap} .\nUser Interface:If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , {gap} it doesn't matter if it's double {disfmarker} I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double {disfmarker} rubber double curved case ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} rubble double double . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing ,\nProject Manager:I'll have a Big Mac , please . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it {disfmarker} if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go {disfmarker} I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . So , either {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case .\nProject Manager:Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .\nUser Interface:Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way .\nIndustrial Designer:Let's go crazy . {vocalsound} And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be {disfmarker} so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Simple , yeah . Chip on print . It's a bit {gap} . {vocalsound} Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} . Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The infra-red . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? {vocalsound} Y um {vocalsound} what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} so it sounds {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . {vocalsound} I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .\nIndustrial Designer:Fo It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . Totally . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um we wanna go for an i i all {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So let's not go for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so long as it works ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . I agree .\nProject Manager:you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah . S yeah , push buttons .\nMarketing:What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?\nUser Interface:I think push-buttons is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What about what ?\nMarketing:G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?\nMarketing:Mm , I dunno . Be cool .\nIndustrial Designer:It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Channel two . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:S\nUser Interface:Th the the {vocalsound} speech recognition um option is {disfmarker} it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product .\nUser Interface:'cause uh {disfmarker} The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um {disfmarker} That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But , I mean , it's not {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hm .\nUser Interface:it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns {disfmarker} comes on , but it's not that . It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response .\nMarketing:Oh , it just gives an answer .\nUser Interface:So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh , then then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Just if you are really lonely , maybe . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I thought I thought it was {disfmarker} when they said {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like ,\nIndustrial Designer:Channel five . And then it switches on .\nMarketing:channel five , and it will change .\nUser Interface:No , tha that w that w that would be more promising .\nMarketing:Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It it's just a remote that talks to you .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh . {vocalsound} I mean to certain cues .\nMarketing:Oh , then {gap} forget about it . Oh right okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:'Kay . Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery .\nProject Manager:Basic battery .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Cheaper option . Are you happy with that ?\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So we'll go for the battery . Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?\nProject Manager:We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The the {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So it will look like something like this .\nIndustrial Designer:Double ?\nProject Manager:The double whopper , please .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons ,\nProject Manager:Yep , but {disfmarker} we're going for the simple buttons .\nUser Interface:So rubber rubber keys , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and that's fine ?\nProject Manager:And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it\nIndustrial Designer:P\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ {disfmarker} people were getting the {disfmarker} complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So that's another marketing point that we can use .\nMarketing:Well the rubber push-buttons {gap} . Don't you have to move your {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But anything is gonna have buttons .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . You {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You see , you can still get {disfmarker} it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen .\nIndustrial Designer:That they don't . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same {disfmarker} doing the same movement .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:It's not actually what you are doing .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , the rubber's good .\nUser Interface:We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , so they can sit there and go like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful .\nProject Manager:And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright , that's me done .\nProject Manager:Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's {disfmarker} the interface .\nUser Interface:Alright . Alright . Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about .\nProject Manager:Great .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry .\nUser Interface:Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh {disfmarker} they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um the other suggestion ,\nMarketing:That does get annoying .\nUser Interface:and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have {gap} lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or {gap} ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh {gap} um {disfmarker} So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button {gap} in our last {disfmarker} I can give you an example here of uh , {gap} good layout and bad layout\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:uh from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose .\nProject Manager:Do we have an uh example of a good one ? {gap} {vocalsound} Brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh-huh . Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And for {disfmarker} something for kids . Yeah . Um .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of {disfmarker} we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well let's um {disfmarker} so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The um {disfmarker} The the um the interface type we're going for {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So we're {disfmarker} we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh .\nProject Manager:Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons .\nUser Interface:So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . I think we shall have a limited number of buttons ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh . And some sort of {disfmarker} it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that .\nProject Manager:Okay , and we're not {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Well now that we've decided on our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} Are we gonna hav hav {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} are we d\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy ,\nProject Manager:We're {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Maybe we can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but um {disfmarker} Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey . Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . Let's move over to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I I guess {vocalsound} the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .\nProject Manager:Yeah , sure .\nUser Interface:I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:But I think that should be {disfmarker} I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating .\nProject Manager:Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah .\nUser Interface:So that should be simple .\nProject Manager:Cool .\nMarketing:Right . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets\nProject Manager:Mm yeah .\nMarketing:and what the fashions are for next year . Um . So yes {vocalsound} , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market {vocalsound} these are like most important aspects like that we really need to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:which we've already probably discussed . Um {vocalsound} the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already {disfmarker} that we already have . So it has to be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ?\nMarketing:Yep .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Exactly .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What's that mean ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work .\nUser Interface:Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense ,\nMarketing:Should {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .\nMarketing:That's new .\nProject Manager:Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'cause our rubber one is not fancy {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we {disfmarker} maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either .\nProject Manager:Maybe we could um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So , {gap} no loose {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is {vocalsound} , like people {disfmarker} and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .\nProject Manager:Of course , they do .\nMarketing:Well , they do , but it's like it's not {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not .\nMarketing:Yeah , but it looks good . If it looks good and it's {disfmarker} it can just be there for decoration . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , well , what do you two think about this ?\nUser Interface:So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other\nMarketing:But like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , what {disfmarker} I don't understand what m\nUser Interface:electronics ?\nMarketing:You could always insert , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do ,\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:right ?\nProject Manager:and it {disfmarker} this is just gonna {gap} {disfmarker} all this is being used for is your television .\nMarketing:Yeah , but , I mean , people like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It would {disfmarker} that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does ,\nMarketing:Well , if you're looking at {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you {gap} looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:does it ? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect {disfmarker} for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . Things like that .\nProject Manager:No , that would be your telephone {gap} in with your television .\nIndustrial Designer:No i\nUser Interface:Yeah , the {disfmarker} that wouldn't be the remote so much ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface:I mean {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and i\nIndustrial Designer:No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically .\nIndustrial Designer:I with the television , yeah . {gap} I was just trying to find an advantage . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Well , it doesn't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:An and there is no there is no such thing\nMarketing:Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery {disfmarker} it could be something really really minor , you know , like {disfmarker} but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , this {disfmarker} that's that's very good .\nMarketing:And then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Change the batteries ever again .\nProject Manager:And and this is all tying in very nicely .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes , so can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But yeah , by the squeezing it the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think , safety s\nUser Interface:Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating {disfmarker} like the energy generator .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done .\nMarketing:Yeah . Third most important aspect {vocalsound} uh is it's easy to use .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} we're all about that .\nMarketing:And I think we've all um worked that out . Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . {vocalsound} So next year people will be buying {vocalsound} , I found this really funny {vocalsound} , you know , strawberry shaped chairs ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I wanna watch the pineapple channel . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Rubber things . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Well spongy , that's where {gap} . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's great for us .\nMarketing:yeah , so we're in .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . And so personal {gap} what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . So yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{gap} . I had to say {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:So we're moving in the right direction like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so through all that we've {disfmarker} we go we're {disfmarker} right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yep .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's great .\nProject Manager:that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can {disfmarker} as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries {vocalsound} ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager:and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No vegetables .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:We don't have to follow every trend , I guess .\nMarketing:Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:Some sort . Or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:The power button could be like a big apple or something .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , this is true {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:They don they don't own {vocalsound} all images of apples . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} sued the Beatles so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be ,\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:or like are we going {disfmarker} yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ?\nMarketing:Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think , if it's rubber it needs to be\nProject Manager:I mean you said earlier on i {vocalsound} it should be funky .\nMarketing:different . I think , it's {disfmarker} it should be {disfmarker} I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} L keep it clean , keep it clean . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:really different colours basically .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material {vocalsound} that material ? {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um like I'm just thinking bright colours .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Bright natural colours , nothing too {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Bright , but not too bright . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Bright , but too {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so {vocalsound} anybody can choo like like {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like the volume buttons should be the {disfmarker} all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah . And on the back of it have the logo .\nProject Manager:Okay , what {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Why not ?\nProject Manager:Okay . Tha\nUser Interface:The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I mean we {disfmarker} that's we we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} This is the remote control tomato . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I mean {vocalsound} what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . Like {disfmarker} and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and {disfmarker} Yeah . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} I'm gonna write that down .\nMarketing:So {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap}\nMarketing:so it's rea it's quite\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:it's quite like um user friendly\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like {gap} pink remote control for their room something .\nProject Manager:So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour {vocalsound} wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . So they also get to pick . Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour .\nUser Interface:Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod ,\nMarketing:It's um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Although I'd be curious to see how many uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:D you've got the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour .\nProject Manager:Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And produce less of the silly colours , maybe .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Alright . Well um , we'll {disfmarker} alright let's {disfmarker} what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um {vocalsound} is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know {disfmarker} come up with the the user interface design . Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . You won't be going off to your separate offices .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh right .\nProject Manager:I think , yeah , it's gonna {vocalsound} you know ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nProject Manager:We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It is .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:you know now we can actually start , you know , s some sort of physical something or other .\nUser Interface:That sounds good .\nProject Manager:Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Evaluation .\nProject Manager:Um . {vocalsound} And I {vocalsound} will be uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:talking to the bosses , basically , and uh\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:f fielding off some more spam and uh\nIndustrial Designer:Great .\nProject Manager:that's it really . Keeping things t well , uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . Um . Yeah , that's {disfmarker} This is this is uh good . So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . We definitely know how it's powered ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . Um . {gap} you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things {disfmarker} are there extra things this product have ? We'll look into this lock key\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:facility , although whether or not it happens , {vocalsound} or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into . Okay . I think that's um {disfmarker} well done everybody . Anyone have any uh any questions ,\nUser Interface:Alright .\nProject Manager:everyone know what they're doing ? 'Cause if you don't , you'll {disfmarker} I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now .\nMarketing:S This gives you all the details ?\nProject Manager:Okay . right well .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so bef before you all disappear off just\nUser Interface:Okay , I'll stay in here .\nMarketing:{gap} {vocalsound} um .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:hold hold fire . Um .\nUser Interface:Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So we really have a incentive to make this remote work .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well .\nProject Manager:I want a share in the space rocket . Did you {gap} see that this k that this company {gap} we've made a spaceship .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:Well I I did notice looking at {disfmarker} I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:R_R_ . Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's {disfmarker} doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's true .\nProject Manager:And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ {vocalsound} {gap} have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Doesn't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker} I still want one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Right , well , I guess that's us .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It's not telling {disfmarker} it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . So maybe you should go back to your own offices .\nUser Interface:Okay . Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Are we taking these off ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , it says you two {disfmarker}\n",
        "summary": "This meeting is mainly about three presentations from three team members to talk about what the team is supposed to be doing. First, it was the Industrial Designer's presentation on energy source and case material ; then, User Interface introduced potential buttons, the layout design, and the color of the remote control ; and at last, Marketing made a presentation on three important marketing points that the team should pay attention to, which are fancy appearance, innovative technology and user-friendliness.

So the popularity of the {disfmarker} since the popularity of the internet ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . And of course we should have our image {gap} in the in the design . So , let's start with the the industrial designer .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , alright .\nProject Manager:Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh {disfmarker} Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder\nProject Manager:Here .\nIndustrial Designer:so I I I think you can reach it from here .\nMarketing:Just go to explorer .\nProject Manager:Oh okay .\nMarketing:Or open . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer:Participant two .\nProject Manager:This one .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Open uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh open . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do you want to open {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Because it's open you mean . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} F_ five .\nMarketing:Slide show , view slide show , {gap} .\nProject Manager:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the {disfmarker} our new remote control for television .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So uh can you go one page down , please . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So uh mm I'm thin uh {vocalsound} I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible {vocalsound} things we hav we can use . Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box {vocalsound} would uh look look like .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . Okay so can you go down uh {disfmarker} So , wha what I think {vocalsound} for now {vocalsound} is {vocalsound} we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the {gap} . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the {vocalsound} the schema of the {vocalsound} o of the future uh remote controls\nUser Interface:Did you draw it ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Wow . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set .\nUser Interface:This {gap} .\nProject Manager:This {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What is the other chip for ? The one on top .\nIndustrial Designer:The one on top is for the um {disfmarker} well the functionali the functionalities\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:One is a communication .\nIndustrial Designer:and the the th red um {disfmarker} sorry the green one is is to {disfmarker} well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to {gap} uh to communicate with the T_V_ set .\nUser Interface:For men . To the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And , that's it . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for {vocalsound} for the functionalities which is easy to to t\nUser Interface:Mm . What is F_P_G_A_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's field programmable uh something array .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Gateway arrays .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:It's a field programmable gateway arrays .\nUser Interface:So why's it {disfmarker} how is it different from the Bluetooth ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can {gap} pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Programme it .\nMarketing:Yeah {gap} .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} So this are the {disfmarker} they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No . Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Or it's something like {disfmarker} isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software .\nUser Interface:Is the is the software par alri okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah to run th to make it run .\nUser Interface:Okay , okay .\nMarketing:That's it .\nUser Interface:So you can control {gap} if you want , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright and that's it for the working design .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So if you have any questions ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay , and how about the battery power ? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nMarketing:Into the {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah into the t .\nMarketing:more compact and uh {disfmarker} okay , {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And uh I I don't think it will need um {vocalsound} very uh much power to make it run , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm . Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . It's a good idea .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm . Uh {disfmarker} mm .\nMarketing:We just make a small charger\nUser Interface:Y yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:and put it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You can i yeah .\nUser Interface:Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's a good idea .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ma\nIndustrial Designer:Also , but but {vocalsound} I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote {vocalsound} control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I dunno . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Bu {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah we can change the b {gap} .\nMarketing:Our remote ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} S {vocalsound} okay , so charger for {gap} is the {gap} .\nProject Manager:Um .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So is mine .\nProject Manager:It's mine . Participant one , no ?\nUser Interface:Oh . Yeah , this your {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm . Oh we have {gap} so let's move to to user interface design {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can open uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Participant {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:three . Yeah . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} So I'm working on the technical functions design . {gap} can you show the next slide . So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . So {vocalsound} so I found on a webs on the internet\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} During the weekend .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} I spent a lot of time searching {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's good . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .\nMarketing:G\nUser Interface:So I found two very good prototypes for {vocalsound} for this interface from our competitors\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so can you {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This are usual functionality {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , yeah . Ours is a bit uh different . So these are two example . One is from {vocalsound} {gap} the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah .\nProject Manager:Tasks .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:This is the most competing prototypes I've found {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But then uh loo but then I found if you look at {disfmarker} you see on the left one there are too many buttons {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And they are small {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah . O on the right I tried to play with {vocalsound} the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:so it's very lousy .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So you {vocalsound} so you move to the next the next one .\nIndustrial Designer:Of course .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so I talk about the problem . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can {gap} the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end {disfmarker} in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some {disfmarker} to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the {vocalsound} on the remote controller , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And then we {disfmarker} the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in {disfmarker} we may K_I_V_ .\nProject Manager:What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_\nUser Interface:Yeah , all the processing is done {disfmarker} the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:than the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So we have to t\nProject Manager:So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , we don't {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} are you just wondering what controller {disfmarker} okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think so . J j just the remote control .\nMarketing:Yeah , not the T_V_s .\nIndustrial Designer:I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's right .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So i the processing on on the remote controller {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ?\nProject Manager:we {gap} . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm . Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Speech recognition .\nUser Interface:N yeah , that's all . The next one ? So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , that's a good idea , I think .\nProject Manager:Keep the navigation\nIndustrial Designer:We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to {disfmarker} i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:It's easy to build ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it does not consume much power . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , that's right .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay , that's all . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to {disfmarker} if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and then uh you {gap} can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . No , because you choose by channel , so {disfmarker} you choose by T_V_ program\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh-huh huh huh huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . If you go by channel , you don't have to do that .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm hmm hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} but uh I I think i i {gap} if you if you want to to make uh {disfmarker} well a a big jump {vocalsound} {gap} but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So you are {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ah . Ah , a big jump .\nMarketing:Yeah then yeah that's right .\nUser Interface:A mouse or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm hmm hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:How the {gap} this remote ?\nIndustrial Designer:But we'll see . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh it's gonna be small .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , of course {vocalsound} small .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So it'll beep if you wanna find it\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {gap} too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:you just uh shout {disfmarker} y h just {disfmarker} it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:that's {gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I dunno how bu {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} just {gap} give it a name and we call him .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And {gap} responds to you , and {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , that's right . Yeah , that's right .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so uh next presentation {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Participant four . So Harry .\nMarketing:Okay , after having the inputs from {vocalsound} industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that {disfmarker} These are the findings which we got and {disfmarker} yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology {disfmarker} We already know that {disfmarker} as discussed earlier {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:An {vocalsound} it does {gap} how feasible it is .\nUser Interface:I- {vocalsound} mm . But I think if you {gap} to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited {disfmarker} you have limited vocabulary {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:We just have the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so it's a good idea .\nMarketing:{gap} it's not going to take much space also . It's going to be very slim .\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm .\nMarketing:And next one was the size of the remote control . It has to be of course a very slim and small one . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:so this is an important criteria here is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility {gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm .\nMarketing:I mean we have to look for a trade-off .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:The features and the cost .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I no {disfmarker} I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort ,\nMarketing:Little bit more if it's with extra features .\nProject Manager:It {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah , extra features .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah . That's right .\nProject Manager:But is it useful or not u I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:There is {gap} in the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Or they say movie name {disfmarker} or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .\nIndustrial Designer:we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well {disfmarker} yes a microphone into the the remote control , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm , I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker} well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think i {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it will be alright . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} If it's necessary can {disfmarker} you can do that .\nUser Interface:What is the teletext ? Mm .\nProject Manager:We can integrate small microphone in the remote\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so it's not really a problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:What about lighting adaptive options ?\nMarketing:Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but {vocalsound} I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .\nProject Manager:According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . Yeah .\nUser Interface:It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex .\nMarketing:I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I mean {disfmarker} yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment {vocalsound} light {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , then we can conclude that . Yeah . Yeah , but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project .\nProject Manager:So we have {disfmarker} I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . Mm-mm . {vocalsound} So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost .\nProject Manager:Expensive . Price .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:And the lighting adaptation\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:and the teletext . And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:If you are watching an foreign movie , you get {gap} subtitles sometimes .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:And if I am a German then I would like to have the {disfmarker} my options in German .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So , the remote {disfmarker} it should have some {disfmarker} it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .\nIndustrial Designer:Function .\nMarketing:That should be a good uh point .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ?\nProject Manager:I think we we can we {disfmarker} {gap} is the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh {vocalsound} about a way to to access the internet via the television .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Because if {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a {disfmarker} w which will c which will come in a few years .\nMarketing:We already have some {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:So if we already have it in our remote control {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So you have to anticipate the the future ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} The future demand , market demand . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , to desi\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , that's right .\nIndustrial Designer:well , not not to implement it , but to {disfmarker} well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a {disfmarker} yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:The functionality in the future .\nProject Manager:In future .\nUser Interface:Alright . Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . So let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , thank you .\nUser Interface:Okay . Thank you .\nMarketing:Okay , thank you .\n",
        "summary": "In the discussion, team members did presentations and talked about the design of the remote control. Project Manager introduced the aim of the second meeting and new project requirement. Project Manager said that the team did not need to pay attention to teletext and lighting adaptive. Then Industrial Designer, User Interface and Marketing gave presentations respectively. Industrial Designer proposed that they could add software functionalities on programmable chips and could use the FPGA. User Interface focused on reducing the number of buttons and recommended navigation buttons. Marketing discussed a lot of ideas including using a speech recogniser, the size of the remote control and lighting adaptive options. In the end they discussed some topics like teletext and accessing the Internet.",

And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . So people can {gap} can use it without any any problem .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh\nUser Interface:Mm . B did you send us an email about this ?\nProject Manager:Uh , not yet ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but if you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Ah it's Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Or you can put it in the shared folder .\nUser Interface:Yeah , you see the email ? You {gap} email . The v very {disfmarker} no , no the first one .\nMarketing:No , I didn't get it .\nUser Interface:It's inside .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:This one .\nUser Interface:No , no .\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:The third one . Oh , you didn't get anything .\nMarketing:No , {gap} .\nUser Interface:It's strange . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:I got an email about the dis about the discussion . Yeah .\nProject Manager:You get email , {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I dunno from who .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , from the account manager .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} From the account manager . You have received the same email , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think it's for your guys to {vocalsound} how to design it all the aspects so you need that information .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think so .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so each of us has a role to do .\nMarketing:Yeah\nProject Manager:S\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think {gap} assign your uh roles .\nUser Interface:In each {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:For each for each one .\nUser Interface:We already have our role .\nMarketing:For each person , yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} 'Kay , we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So there are {disfmarker} so we have three {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So there are three kinds of designs , that's all .\nProject Manager:f yeah . We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design .\nUser Interface:Okay , alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we {disfmarker} in our mail we received from the account manager .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh\nUser Interface:I'm doing the interface .\nProject Manager:You are doing th\nIndustrial Designer:No , I'm doing the interface . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:Are you using the {disfmarker} you are doing the in {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I I'm I'm {disfmarker} Well , maybe we have {disfmarker} okay so I {gap} industrial design . It was a little confusion about my uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Ah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but it's alright .\nProject Manager:Okay , I'll for industrial design .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . And and you {disfmarker} Norman ?\nUser Interface:Mm ? Um working on i . {vocalsound} User interface . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:User .\nProject Manager:And {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh , I'm into marketing .\nProject Manager:{gap} doing the marketing .\nMarketing:{gap} yeah nothing much in the project .\nProject Manager:Nothing related here to the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Marketing in this design .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You see the second mail ? Yeah , it's inside . Go down . Appendix .\nMarketing:Yeah , this is {gap} .\nUser Interface:See there's a role for everybody .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's right ,\nUser Interface:Even for the marketing .\nMarketing:first {gap} . {gap} us user define .\nProject Manager:Next {gap} .\nUser Interface:But look at your role , your marketing role .\nMarketing:There's a trend watching .\nProject Manager:I don't know .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's your role .\nProject Manager:I {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and what are your ideas about the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:About the design or {disfmarker} Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So we have to {vocalsound} plan how how it would be developed and uh\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:how we can make it work {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:I mean working remotes we already have . This will be something different from the other remotes {disfmarker} remote controls .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What we we have to keep in mind the {disfmarker} these characteristics .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I dunno I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And of course it should not be very costly .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's right .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or\nUser Interface:Need to collect information . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:About the {disfmarker} about what ?\nUser Interface:Um . {vocalsound} I I'm part of design , perhaps . Uh , what is most important in a {disfmarker} in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ? Uh .\nProject Manager:You mean the external {gap} or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , you have to make it work .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah of g of course .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's alright .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's the {vocalsound} that's the big thing .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , it should be easy to work with .\nProject Manager:Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We can think about an interface with uh well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh . We {disfmarker} maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . You just tell the television I want {disfmarker} which channel .\nProject Manager:You won't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Or or you can say for example , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I want uh to list all the programme tonight . Y you know {gap} , instead of {gap} uh remote control it's doing the {disfmarker} some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . Just say maybe I just want to press {disfmarker} I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . Or a button for all the magazines , all the information {disfmarker} documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .\nUser Interface:No , because {disfmarker} no ,\nProject Manager:S {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:it's not very {disfmarker} a lot . Th this information exists . For example you can get um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like s uh you you you say we can use speech .\nUser Interface:You can use uh {disfmarker} well for example {disfmarker} anything . {vocalsound} The {vocalsound} the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker} I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno\nMarketing:I'm a {disfmarker} okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand\nProject Manager:In the hand .\nMarketing:and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with {gap} trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yes , possible .\nMarketing:if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it .\nUser Interface:Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And I could talk to the T_V_ {disfmarker} television itself .\nProject Manager:Except if if you are far from the T_V_ .\nMarketing:I need not have an {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I mean we have some {gap} or something , different technology but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:This is {vocalsound} it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um {vocalsound} there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme .\nIndustrial Designer:On the content .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So it's more powerful . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No . No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . They they are {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . We don't care . We just say that this are some content . We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . Some of the websites they already provide this service ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:so we can just use the service available . Download it uh to the {disfmarker} to this remote control .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:And then there's {disfmarker} there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so {vocalsound} you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the {disfmarker} Well channel programme or contents or {disfmarker} in an easy way , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:This is {gap} good idea .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Ah , yes . So {gap} . Yeah . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen\nUser Interface:Good idea {vocalsound} . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f\nUser Interface:I think I think that will be revol revolutionary {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So we have five minutes to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board .\nProject Manager:Ah you can y you can you can use it if you {disfmarker} so , can we\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Five minutes .\nMarketing:And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh {vocalsound} some dark scene , the lights adapt themself .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:S\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:The lighting in the room changes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , but we are designing just remote control .\nProject Manager:You {disfmarker} it {gap} .\nMarketing:I mean , we have a option in the remote control . If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . If if you you you can if you want you can use th the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Please , Norman , draw uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Go on , draw something {gap} . {vocalsound} Mm .\nMarketing:Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel .\nUser Interface:Where is it ?\nMarketing:The lapel .\nProject Manager:Or before the before the the design that says {gap} .\nUser Interface:Ah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Where where is it ? Here .\nMarketing:Yeah , that one .\nProject Manager:Norman .\nMarketing:Just plug it .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's right .\nProject Manager:Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says {gap} what we what we said\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:then after that you can you can use the {gap} . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , alright . So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? We agree on that , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh , uh first one is to uh {vocalsound} buttons i or it could be anything with {gap} buttons . Uh to choose uh content s or channels .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So we have both . The user can choose w which one they want , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , by content or by channel ,\nUser Interface:By content or by channel .\nIndustrial Designer:it's a good idea .\nUser Interface:Choose by contents or by channels . And then what did we say just now ? Other than this .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents .\nUser Interface:Okay , so technically how {disfmarker} the problems that {disfmarker} how to do it is to {disfmarker} how to get the content .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Challenge .\nIndustrial Designer:I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . Content . Okay , so these we have to work it out . So this one of the problem . And uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think that's the {gap} the things to do\nUser Interface:The main thing .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh to uh reflect about it\nUser Interface:Okay . Alright . Alright , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh discuss it in the next meeting .\nUser Interface:So we are {disfmarker} we'll discuss it {disfmarker} we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer {gap} ? That's the first aspect . Right . We will {gap} get information and then we'll come back in . {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Thank you everybody . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , we'll come .\nProject Manager:So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects .\nUser Interface:Alright . Alright , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Well thank you all {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Thank you , mis {vocalsound}\n",

Um I'm glad you could all come . I'm really excited to start this team . Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . My name is Rose Lindgren . I I'll be the Project Manager . Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . First of all our project aim . Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three {vocalsound} compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating . Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . Um Alima ,\nIndustrial Designer:Alima .\nProject Manager:sorry , Alima .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me .\nProject Manager:Probably both .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . I have no drawing skills whatsoever . But uh let's see , introduce myself . My name is Alima Bucciantini . Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . I'm doing nationalism studies , blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents .\nProject Manager:How do you spell your name ?\nIndustrial Designer:A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ .\nProject Manager:Thanks .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . So let's see if I can get\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:um here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . And you have the pretty little shell going on . Some little eyes . Happy . There you go . That's a turtle .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:So what are your favourite characteristics ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Excellent .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Shall we just go around the table ?\nUser Interface:Uh Okay . Well , my name is Iain uh\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um . And I'll try and draw my favourite animal .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No ,\nUser Interface:I'll {disfmarker} I should leave that one on there\nIndustrial Designer:you can erase the turtle ,\nUser Interface:shouldn't I {vocalsound} before I callously rub it off .\nIndustrial Designer:it's alright .\nProject Manager:Might be nice to have them all up there at same time .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Is that at least identifiable ?\nIndustrial Designer:Snake .\nMarketing:Well .\nProject Manager:Em\nIndustrial Designer:Well ,\nUser Interface:It's a whale {vocalsound} , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:snake ? {vocalsound} It's w {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Thanks .\nMarketing:Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're {disfmarker} well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . And I just find them interesting animals .\nMarketing:Take my contraptions with me . Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , {gap} animal . Don't really know how to draw this . Just where can I {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . Maybe if I do the water ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but how ? Sort of give an idea . {vocalsound} I have no idea how one would explain this . Mm maybe with some whiskers . Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:You can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay . Mm 'kay ? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , {vocalsound} from California . Um . Hmm . {vocalsound} S {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh ,\nMarketing:It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it .\nIndustrial Designer:a cat .\nProject Manager:Um it's actually a coyote .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Let's see . Let's see ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's impressive .\nProject Manager:let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth .\nIndustrial Designer:That's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's pretty impressive .\nUser Interface:Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh dear . {vocalsound} Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . We have coyotes howl all the time . So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . Mm . {vocalsound} Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple {vocalsound} we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such {disfmarker} this is for television it's a {disfmarker} we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could {disfmarker} I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you {disfmarker} what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I just wanna watch the T_V_ {vocalsound} um .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Always gets lost . Some sort of like device to help you find it .\nUser Interface:I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um . I find them {disfmarker} they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of {disfmarker} in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah um . I agree with having too many remotes around . My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um . What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , I think there is a way around that ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's {disfmarker} if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um I would imagine all of them ,\nIndustrial Designer:I know .\nProject Manager:but we could {disfmarker} but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , something that doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . So how do we work with that ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Could we get something that just has {disfmarker} No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for {disfmarker} that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:channel changing .\nMarketing:And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the {disfmarker} whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:N that way {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So like you have to have them somewhere ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Good question .\nUser Interface:um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I don't know that yet .\nUser Interface:Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:It's a good question . Um . {vocalsound} I'll look into that .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm hmm .\nProject Manager:If I can .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think it's just T_V_ , I mean , if it {disfmarker} if we're taking it just {gap} new product a new television remote control that's not like {vocalsound} doesn't say .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah .\nMarketing:You know , things might be more advanced than that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So we should {disfmarker} maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well , I mean I suppose it would be nice to have {vocalsound} playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . If it's just a television then that {disfmarker} it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's an idea with the buttons being really {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Large . If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . Mind if we move on ? Ps\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:mm okay .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um ,\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um the User Interface Designer , that's for {gap} . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay um . And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . Um so very exited to see all your animals and how {disfmarker} what wonderful um artists we all are {vocalsound} um .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? Do we know that ?\nProject Manager:I haven't gotten an agenda yet , um I'll put that together . I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm sure we'll be busy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um .\nUser Interface:Okay . Can you e-mail your slides as well ? Is that possible ?\nProject Manager:Yes , I yes , I think I can . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Cool\nProject Manager:I'll just attach it to an email . And you're you're number two ,\nIndustrial Designer:I'm two .\nProject Manager:three , four ?\nMarketing:I'm four .\nProject Manager:Is that correct ? Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nProject Manager:Excellent . It was lovely meeting you all .\nUser Interface:'Kay\nProject Manager:Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Let me see if I can do that right now .\n",

Good afternoon again .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of {disfmarker} detail design of the product of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} So here is the agenda for today . Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . And we'll have um {vocalsound} presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro . {vocalsound} Okay . So let's go . Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . {vocalsound} So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . We went through the use of wheels and but buttons . {vocalsound} And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . Okay . Um . Good . So guys let {gap} this uh wonderful thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so we can go to the slides .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh yeah . Sorry . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Number three . Oh number two sorry .\nProject Manager:Which is {gap} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So final design . Final design . Okay so Michael you can go ahead .\nUser Interface:Yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow {disfmarker} well to make a banana\nProject Manager:Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe .\nUser Interface:remote {disfmarker} okay so we actually have a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You can pull it out first , maybe .\nUser Interface:We've {disfmarker} well first first of all we made a an attractive {vocalsound} base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:bana sit {disfmarker} the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself , it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . We've got the two uh {vocalsound} uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath {vocalsound} we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .\nProject Manager:What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?\nUser Interface:This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh {disfmarker} through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you {disfmarker} quickly rather th\nProject Manager:Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . But normally with uh {disfmarker} it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:And we we do have one more functionality . If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ .\nUser Interface:The T_V_ yeah .\nProject Manager:Which one ?\nUser Interface:The s the turbo button .\nIndustrial Designer:The turbo button .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .\nIndustrial Designer:Additional button .\nMarketing:What this button for ?\nUser Interface:This is a teletext button . So once you press that then you get teletext\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:To navigate it through th through teletext .\nUser Interface:To navigate yeah .\nMarketing:But if you want to go to page seven hundred ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's right , that's right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap} with the wheel it's easy .\nMarketing:How man\nUser Interface:Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , you press the {gap} the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go {disfmarker} you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't understand it . Can you repeat it ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well you can you can press press the teletext button\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and then you then you can you can f\nIndustrial Designer:So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And you can tele\nMarketing:Ah okay okay . Okay . Okay okay .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah ,\nUser Interface:Mm uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .\nMarketing:Okay . I see . I see . Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And this is the uh the infrared uh port .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nUser Interface:Also the top of the banana .\nProject Manager:Excellent .\nUser Interface:So . And then we have\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .\nProject Manager:Calling . Excellent .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?\nUser Interface:Actually they do .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:That's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's like antennas .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:But yeah that's um that's just like {disfmarker} that's an attractive um base station .\nProject Manager:Great . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So .\nProject Manager:So , what else ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Is it really weight ? Is it light or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It is very light .\nProject Manager:Yeah , they're light .\nUser Interface:It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:You know , to give you the correct look and feel .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Ok\nIndustrial Designer:And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . Yeah yeah yeah , I see . I under I understand .\nUser Interface:I think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:consider that . {gap} maybe health and safety aspects .\nProject Manager:Ah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh we didn't think of that yet . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So for the power source , apparently you still {disfmarker} you you want to use both solar cells and batteries .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah that's right .\nProject Manager:Uh you mean {disfmarker} okay . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .\nProject Manager:Yeah , where are going to {disfmarker} where are you are you going to place them ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm mm-hmm . It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there .\nUser Interface:If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit\nProject Manager:You have enough surface ? You {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:so that that is {gap} .\nProject Manager:What will be the autonomy ? Roughly ?\nUser Interface:The what sorry ?\nProject Manager:The autonomy . Autonomy .\nUser Interface:What do you mean ?\nProject Manager:Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?\nMarketing:How long the {disfmarker} how long the bit the batteries long .\nUser Interface:Ah . Ah . A long time .\nProject Manager:Yeah . A long {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No no no ,\nIndustrial Designer:Eight to ten eight to ten hours .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:it can {disfmarker} it should be weeks .\nIndustrial Designer:N most {disfmarker} no most of the time it's not being used .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So when when you are making it on {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's used only when you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm-hmm . No eight or eight or ten hours of working .\nUser Interface:Ah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah . F weeks .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That's right .\nProject Manager:Right . Next slide ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . Pricing is {disfmarker} was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . And uh that's it .\nProject Manager:Okay . {gap} Okay . Those really sounds very good .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Nothing else to add ?\nUser Interface:It seems to be falling over .\nMarketing:I l yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I like I like it . Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the {vocalsound} the multifunctional buttons . Looks a bit {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You want to have more functional buttons ?\nMarketing:Looks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say {vocalsound} that .\nIndustrial Designer:You are not convinced .\nMarketing:You {disfmarker} the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Not not many , we we want to keep it simple . So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .\nMarketing:And the volume button will will become {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's up to you , means .\nProject Manager:Well in fact b both will be {disfmarker} could be useful , navigating through teletext .\nIndustrial Designer:Now that {disfmarker} Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .\nUser Interface:Or can move between positions in the in the number .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And what about people who want to use digits ? Butto real buttons ?\nProject Manager:Wow .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more . And anyway {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ?\nUser Interface:It's all automatic .\nMarketing:It's all automatic .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay yeah it's fine .\nProject Manager:Very good uh yeah {disfmarker}\nMarketing:W we are living in a wonderful world . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} you th yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Bananas everywhere .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Automatically configure {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So we have to go through now evaluations .\nIndustrial Designer:Evalua yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So your slides are ready ?\nMarketing:S\nProject Manager:Uh you're four I think .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So this is one , which one is this one ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . I {vocalsound} I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . And each criteria is {vocalsound} will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is {disfmarker} or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .\nIndustrial Designer:Why this strange factor of seven ?\nMarketing:Because i I'm sorry . Sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten .\nMarketing:Ah yeah . It's from {disfmarker} sorry , it's from one to seven . It's from from one to seven sorry . Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Num number {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and five is too short and nine is too long .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I'm a I I'm {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay fine , got the idea .\nProject Manager:So to have {disfmarker} in order to have enough granularity {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sorry ?\nProject Manager:it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:The variance is mi it's is minimal .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , okay , great .\nMarketing:I'm um answering your question .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Go ahead .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And that's the criteria I I found more useful . I think I sh I {vocalsound} I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Sure .\nMarketing:And we all four could range\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Yeah yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:could evaluate the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:So you can say fancy , handy . Handy .\nMarketing:Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's fancy , according to me .\nMarketing:Seven but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , six .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:S seven .\nIndustrial Designer:Seven . Seven by me .\nProject Manager:Six .\nMarketing:I would say seven .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:It's quite fancy .\nIndustrial Designer:So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , wait .\nUser Interface:Yeah uh five .\nProject Manager:What do you say seven ? Five ?\nIndustrial Designer:Five .\nUser Interface:Five , maybe maybe maybe six it's it's I guess it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , six point five .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:Handy ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Again I'll give seven .\nProject Manager:Seven .\nUser Interface:I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels\nMarketing:Six .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote .\nProject Manager:So seven , seven ,\nIndustrial Designer:Seven for me .\nProject Manager:six ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Six .\nProject Manager:six point five . Functional . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll give five .\nProject Manager:Four .\nMarketing:I would say {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?\nMarketing:Everything ar\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh for a remote control , does he have all the {gap}\nUser Interface:You know .\nMarketing:Mm everything {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . {gap}\nProject Manager:you could expect .\nMarketing:It's compared to the all\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nMarketing:remote controls .\nUser Interface:That's before {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's right . The standards . What is available in the market off the shelf .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I have to say four .\nMarketing:Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro\nUser Interface:Well it's not a universal remote . Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well all T_V_s but only T_ {disfmarker} only T_V_s I guess .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So it's universal but for T_V_s . {vocalsound} So s uh four ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Five .\nProject Manager:Five ?\nUser Interface:Four .\nProject Manager:Four .\nMarketing:Four . Four .\nIndustrial Designer:So four point two ?\nUser Interface:Just four .\nProject Manager:Four .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} four . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Obviously there are some outliers so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So four ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay cool ? Cool device .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:There I'll give it seven .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It means cool features , like new features actually .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Which {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Seven .\nMarketing:I would say five .\nUser Interface:I'll say five .\nProject Manager:Six .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Seven .\nProject Manager:Plus six , I say {disfmarker} I said seven .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So it's six .\nUser Interface:S yeah .\nMarketing:You said seven ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'Cause it's five five seven seven so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh , okay , definitely easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer:Definitely seven .\nUser Interface:Seven .\nProject Manager:Seven . Seven . And you ? Outl you are not lik outlier .\nMarketing:Five . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Seven {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay okay okay okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Sorry , I have them {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Alright , now here's the sixty million Dollar question ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:well , twenty five twenty five Euro question .\nProject Manager:Of course I'll buy the {gap} banana . {gap}\nUser Interface:What do you what do you guys reckon ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll say five .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll say five .\nProject Manager:Twenty five Euros . {vocalsound} Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I find it quite cheap {vocalsound} actually .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I dunno . If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ? {vocalsound} It's more targeting U_K_ or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't know . Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So this is selling costs , not production costs .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah this is the the initial specifications .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah sure . Um {disfmarker} Five .\nMarketing:I would say six . It's quite cheap actually .\nUser Interface:I'd say two .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Aw , should be nice in your {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Why ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I don't want a banana on my {vocalsound} living room table , a banana remote .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No but it's really handy actually if you see .\nUser Interface:It is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible .\nIndustrial Designer:It's it's so handy . And then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's kitsch .\nIndustrial Designer:Anyb anybody who comes here {vocalsound} {disfmarker} anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , but it's not a positive thing .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a very positive thing if you see like that {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Well , you know , it's it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's a banana .\nProject Manager:Well , don't forget well , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh\nIndustrial Designer:Youngsters .\nProject Manager:yeah , youngst youngst\nUser Interface:Yeah but it says I , I would buy this , so .\nMarketing:Actually maybe {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} if you would be young .\nMarketing:Yeah {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Not telling that you are young . Li li like a teenager for instance .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No , it's I . I would buy {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things .\nIndustrial Designer:You want to flaunt .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You {disfmarker} with your girlfriend or something .\nProject Manager:Yeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have . {gap}\nUser Interface:S s\nIndustrial Designer:Or might be it does some other kind of thing but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Still I I'd say two . I don't think I {disfmarker} at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah , crazy .\nProject Manager:Okay so you s you give {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I can say , maybe there is a market for it , I dunno .\nProject Manager:oh yeah yeah I know I know .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So you say two .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I say five .\nProject Manager:F I d I say five . You say ?\nMarketing:I change the question . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So what's the new question ?\nIndustrial Designer:And you have saved it ?\nMarketing:So yeah upload the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You'll have to reload .\nProject Manager:Uh yeah , I think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , so , it depends if uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah it's two different situations . If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one .\nProject Manager:Yeah that's two different question .\nUser Interface:If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it . Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look\nProject Manager:Ugly .\nUser Interface:worse than a banana . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:They're not going to be as {disfmarker} And they they might not be a as easy as this {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And it {disfmarker} yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:So ? What now ? What range ?\nProject Manager:I stick to five .\nIndustrial Designer:S\nUser Interface:Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I go slightly up . Six .\nMarketing:Six .\nUser Interface:so I dunno . Um .\nProject Manager:W we have six , five {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'd give it I'd give it a\nProject Manager:Three {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I give it a four now .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Six ? Six ?\nProject Manager:So we are six , five , four {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Six , five , four .\nMarketing:Six , so it's uh five point five , or less .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . Um , zero . No uh we can't . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Actually yeah , I {disfmarker} we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well if {gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:No uh let's say I'll put two .\nUser Interface:I'd say three , I mean my remote control is kinda {disfmarker} at home is pretty terrible . If it was {disfmarker} change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to\nProject Manager:It's for the T_V_ .\nUser Interface:but uh {disfmarker} 'cause it's really bad but uh {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'd say a three . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll still give it five . Yeah .\nMarketing:Five ?\nProject Manager:Two three five two three fi and two .\nMarketing:{gap} You are romantic , really .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So it's somewhere three point five I think .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I would say two .\nProject Manager:So it's r Yeah , three point five . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Who is the outlier ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Wh wh {vocalsound} you said five ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No no you say five , he is the outlier .\nIndustrial Designer:No I said five .\nProject Manager:Okay just just do a sum .\nMarketing:I don't know if {vocalsound} it's a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No because there are more {disfmarker} yeah , we shouldn't sum like that .\nProject Manager:Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob\nMarketing:Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Otherwise we wouldn't {disfmarker} we will not sell .\nUser Interface:Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ?\nMarketing:Uh no I didn't {gap} anything . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well just leave it at that then .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oops .\nProject Manager:So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a {disfmarker} out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .\nMarketing:Yeah , the uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Problem with connectors ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Do you want me to sum\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah it's it's funny . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:o I think it's not {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so .\nProject Manager:Okay . So let's move uh let's move on .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , {gap} now now we have to mm to estimate {vocalsound} uh the cost okay . So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . We should we should be below twelve point five . So I already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . We are going to go through {vocalsound} {disfmarker} so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells .\nUser Interface:Well we decided against the solar cells so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah finally we say no .\nIndustrial Designer:Solar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that .\nProject Manager:Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . So hand dynamo . This something we didn't thought about . But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You mean , charging it by shaking the banana .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay so we we stick to battery , one .\nIndustrial Designer:To bring the cost {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:No kinetic also . I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo .\nUser Interface:Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ah you have to {disfmarker} ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:S\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Crazy . Okay . So those banana is falling . Let's go ahead . So we we st only have one for battery . Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And that's it .\nProject Manager:Okay . No {disfmarker} so we hin\nIndustrial Designer:And we have sample speaker .\nProject Manager:Yeah so one .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . {gap} the cost of that is very high .\nProject Manager:Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing . So we are {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well actually that that {disfmarker} no that sample speaker is not {disfmarker} we we're not using that , we're just using the the very beep {disfmarker} simple beep ,\nProject Manager:The beep .\nUser Interface:that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:That's what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay so I'll remove it .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:S\nUser Interface:I say that {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:So don't we need a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And we have sev\nProject Manager:Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So we we'll put some extras , if there is something .\nProject Manager:Yeah maybe . We'll see later .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay so in {disfmarker} for the case um {vocalsound} I put single curved .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . To reduce the cost , it's okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well , wait a second ,\nProject Manager:Because we have two things .\nUser Interface:no , it's it's double curved , it's got a c , it's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh it's got all the directions\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:so don't worry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well d yeah it's monotonic {vocalsound} but\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's got a {gap} direction . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:it's got {disfmarker} but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved , one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides .\nProject Manager:Well . What a {disfmarker} what i if I put one here .\nUser Interface:This is actually {disfmarker} I mean this probably\nMarketing:Actually what's the differen\nUser Interface:this probably actually costs more than three\nProject Manager:Yeah so let's put one here in the {gap} then instead of single\nUser Interface:if you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:oka all right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That's right .\nUser Interface:Well {gap} {disfmarker} no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No , it's too {disfmarker} no .\nUser Interface:{gap} if you drop it ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Too expensive .\nProject Manager:It's too expensive . We're already at eleven .\nUser Interface:Well when {disfmarker} okay . Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in .\nProject Manager:Okay so I put rubber one . Okay so special colour , yellow .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh for the interface we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We don't have any push buttons .\nUser Interface:No , we have two push buttons .\nProject Manager:We have three .\nIndustrial Designer:No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that .\nUser Interface:Huh .\nProject Manager:No no . We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah okay , okay .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay it's gonna have to be plastic .\nMarketing:Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here .\nProject Manager:No it's {gap} no chip . This is just radio frequency {gap} . Th This is no chip .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah but\nIndustrial Designer:No . There's no chip there .\nMarketing:you need {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It just emits the signal .\nProject Manager:It's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And the receiver accepts it and that's it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Fo i it does nothing actually ?\nProject Manager:No . Just {disfmarker} only {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Just se sends the signal , that's it .\nUser Interface:It's a recharger thing and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons .\nUser Interface:Well I actually did um think about it myself {vocalsound} but I thought you know {disfmarker} because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a {disfmarker} instead of a turbo button\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:but you know the turbo button does add that extra class .\nProject Manager:so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:You know . So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that .\nProject Manager:Okay . So no L_C_D_ , so for {disfmarker} we have no button supplements , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep . No .\nProject Manager:Uh {vocalsound} well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because {disfmarker} oh no , these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials .\nUser Interface:Yeah . No we're not {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:we don't need anything special for the buttons .\nProject Manager:Okay so we are over budget .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So first thing which we should take care of is ,\nUser Interface:Make it plastic instead of rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:instead of rubber , let it be plastic .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:So mayb in fact n we have to put two here\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:because it cost nothing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of {vocalsound} plastic .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which {disfmarker} the cord and everything which'll go {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff .\nUser Interface:Does that include charging circuitry and everything ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nProject Manager:Yeah maybe . Okay good . Wha\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Excellent .\nUser Interface:So what do we do with the extra profits ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The next fruit .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So well we're under the the the cost . So we can go to {disfmarker} through to project evaluation . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . Would {disfmarker} yeah , would buy .\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nUser Interface:No we have a product which none of us would buy . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah because th th the evaluation project {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Which is different . Which is different . None of us will buy it .\nUser Interface:No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it .\nMarketing:Ah would buy , yeah .\nUser Interface:We're n\nMarketing:Massively , yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah . We're not in Milan or Paris .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay . Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times , so .\nProject Manager:This is a battery . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Actually there were a lot of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And you said the lowest {gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This is what we {disfmarker} which you can mm {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:S Detachable battery .\nProject Manager:It did {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:That's 'cause I'm sick of Milan .\nMarketing:Yeah , for the batteries {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Extra battery , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay so um {vocalsound} project process .\nProject Manager:Exac {vocalsound} Well in fact I I did not know {vocalsound} I didn't know really what to say here .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . So I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Should it be more like um like a status of of the {disfmarker} these meetings in fact .\nUser Interface:{gap} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .\nUser Interface:I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah it's really creative .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um {vocalsound} like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:They like that .\nUser Interface:see if they like it .\nProject Manager:Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless .\nIndustrial Designer:Biased .\nProject Manager:So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation {vocalsound} in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:'Cause you know if {disfmarker} well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid , then you know , banana remote control could be fun for them as well .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Might have to draw a face on it . So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .\nProject Manager:Yep . Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ? Dunno , oranges ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . The cost of the thing can be made more than might be . Because I think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Interface .\nUser Interface:Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I'm not sure really how complicated our um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:our needs are . I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:you know to process that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right .\nMarketing:The complexity shouldn't be much higher .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:For {disfmarker} you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff , that would be rather cool . I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_\nIndustrial Designer:Integrate .\nUser Interface:and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Very good . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} What else ?\nProject Manager:Well done . I think we we can go\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Home ?\nProject Manager:home .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Happily satisfied . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{gap} Okay so thanks very much .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Bye .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nUser Interface:Thank you .\nMarketing:Bye .\n",
        "summary": "Project Manager started meeting on the detailed design of the remote control. User Interface and Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the prototype with a banana leaf base station and a hand-sized remote with two scroll wheels, the turbo button, the teletext button, the calling button, the rechargeable-batteries power source, and the speaker regular chip. Next, the group evaluated based on Marketing's list of user requirement criteria. Then, groupmates discussed the cost estimation, including the component production cost. They agreed to use plastic instead of rubber material for the dual chips. Also, they agreed not to use LCD and no button supplements to avoid over budget. Lastly, the group discussed the project process. The group agreed they had creativity, while User Interface suggested that they should find out more target markets. Besides, Project Manager suggested doing a street survey. Also, User Interface suggested that they could simplify the interface and the circuit board.",

        "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I determine that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Friday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video conference. A record of the proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation relating to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind all participants that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Can I just then, again, note for the record that, if, for any reason, I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Item 2, then, this afternoon is an evidence session with the Welsh Government on the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, Steve Davies, director of the education directorate, and Huw Morris, who is group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Can I welcome you all and thank you for attending? Minister, I understand you'd like to make a short opening statement.\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you very much, Lynne. And indeed, if I could just begin by, once again, putting on the record my gratitude to everyone who is helping us get through this pandemic. There are a vast number of people who are keeping our school hubs open, looking after vulnerable children, and the children of key workers. Because of them, and their efforts, those key workers are able to carry on their critical roles in responding to COVID-19. I am extremely proud of the way that members of the school community have gone above and beyond. They have kept their schools open out of hours, over the weekends, on bank holidays, and Easter. And it is really heartening and humbling to see the way that they have responded to this crisis. And there are teachers, teaching assistants, and many others, who are helping our children and their parents to keep learning at home. I know that home schooling isn't easy, so I want to say also thank you to parents and carers for their efforts at this time. By keeping their children at home, they are helping us to keep people safe, and reducing pressure on our education system, and on our NHS. Be in no doubt, we are facing many challenges because of this pandemic. My primary concern is, and always will be, the health and well-being of our children, of our young people, and of all the staff in our education settings. And I am very grateful to everyone who is supporting us in these endeavours. Thank you very much\u2014diolch yn fawr. And I'm now happy to answer questions that members of the committee may have this afternoon.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you very much, Minister. I'm sure that the committee echoes the heartfelt thanks you have just given then. The first questions we've got this afternoon are from Hefin David.\nHefin David AM:Good afternoon, Minister. With regard to your five principles, which you've set out today, regarding when schools will reopen, they're very clear that they require a judgment from you. So could you outline when you think that schools might reopen?\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you, Hefin. I am very clear that schools will move to a new phase\u2014because, already, schools are open in many settings; we will move to a new phase when it is safe to do so and when I have advice from the chief medical officer and the chief scientific officer that it is safe to do so.\u00a0I have made very clear in my statement that that is not imminent. I know that in some cases there has been speculation that a return to normal could be with us quite shortly. I'm clear that a return to normal is not imminent, and therefore I'm not in a position to give a date as to when we will see more schools opening up to more children.\nHefin David AM:Have you been given any indication at all by the chief medical officer as to when, in the longer term, it might be?\nKirsty Williams AM:No, I have not been given a date. What I have done today is publish the principles that will aid me in, as you said, me making a decision. So, clearly, we will be relying on the advice of our medical and scientific advisers, but the principles are very clear. Firstly, we will need to consider any decision to have more children returning to school in the context of the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of children and young people and the staff. Obviously, I can't make a decision regarding education in isolation. It will have to be taken in the context of the wider Welsh Government response to dealing with this pandemic. Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that we have clearly communicated that to parents and to staff, on the information that we have used to reach any decisions, to build confidence for parents and professionals, but also to give them time to plan. It will be impossible to move quickly to new ways of working. And we also have to look at\u2014and it's been paraphrased quite a lot today\u2014if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting, which groups they should be. And, finally, how do we operationalise that? How do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be, and how do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we have adequate numbers of workforce available, to the very real questions about how you would do social distancing in the context of education, school transport issues, how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate, for instance? So, there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very, very carefully before we could return, before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of education, and new approaches to what schooling may look like. But, again, I must be absolutely clear to you, members of the committee, and to people watching: it is not feasible, in this sense, that we would move from where we are now to what all of us would regard as normal education and what the operation of schools looked like before the start of this pandemic.\nHefin David AM:So, what is clear from what you've said is that it's going to be phased return. I would assume that would be the most vulnerable\u2014perhaps additional learning needs pupils would return first. Just reading some of the things that you've said today, can you answer that question? And can I also ask: you said that guiding principle No. 3 will be having the confidence of parents, staff and students, based on evidence and information, so they can plan ahead. What will that evidence and information be, and how will you know that you've got the confidence of parents to return?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, as I said, primarily, we will need to take a lead from our scientific and medical advisers. I want to also say that we are obviously working on a four-nation basis and keeping in very close contact with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. But we're also looking beyond the United Kingdom to approaches to education in the face of this pandemic. Members are aware that we as a nation are a member of the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory. So, recently I was able to talk to educationalists and Ministers in Iceland, other parts of Europe, North America, South America and Australia. So, we're also looking at best international evidence in this regard. And, clearly, we will need to be very clear, as today is an attempt to be very clear with parents and our teaching professionals, and the unions that represent them, about the basis of that evidence.\nHefin David AM:And could I just ask, with regard to the principles, do they then apply to further education and universities?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, of course, when we are discussing these challenges, we are doing that with our colleagues in both the school sector but also our colleagues in the FE sector, and we're in close contact with colleagues in higher education to share thinking on these matters.\nHefin David AM:But these principles don't apply in those circumstances; these are principles for schools only.\nKirsty Williams AM:These principles are applying to both, and our work in this area is applying to both schools and FE colleges. Clearly, universities, as independent institutions, we wouldn't be able to dictate to. But I want to be absolutely clear: we are working with representatives of the HE sector to include them in this work. And I have received, not assurances, but from discussions that I've had with Universities Wales and vice-chancellors, they are very keen to be kept apprised of these approaches, because they may well wish to implement something similar within their own institutions.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. I've got a couple of supplementaries now; firstly, from Suzy Davies, and then I'm going to go to Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Suzy. No, we can't hear Suzy. Suzy? No. I'll go to Si\u00e2n, then, and then I'll come back to Suzy. Si\u00e2n.\nHefin David AM:Chair, I don't think my microphone is muted.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. I'll move on to my question to Kirsty Williams. Now, it is clear that any decisions that need to be taken on reopening schools would have to be made in the context of all of the other issues that the Welsh Government has to take into account. And it is entirely clear that the approach of Government towards testing hasn't been sufficiently developed for us to even start to think about removing restrictions. So, wouldn't it be dangerous, if truth be told, to start to discuss reopening schools when we haven't had the necessary testing in place for the majority of the population? And doesn't it convey a mixed message that we're starting to relax some of these restrictions when, in reality, the restrictions are still in place and still need to be in place robustly?\nKirsty Williams AM:First of all, thank you very much, Si\u00e2n, for that important question. Can I be absolutely clear, and I thought I had been pretty clear in answering Hefin David, that we are not relaxing any of the restrictions with regard to education? As I said to Hefin, it is not imminent that we would see a further phase in the next stage of education here in Wales. What I have done today is to provide clarity on the nature of the principles that I would use when coming to any discussion. It is the responsibility of me, as the Minister, and indeed of the wider Government, to begin to think about planning for the future. But I have been absolutely clear: we are not moving to an imminent change in how education is operating at the moment. And I'm also very, very clear that should we be given the opportunity to see more children in our schools, I will only do that when it is safe for me to do so, when I've been advised by the CMO that I am able to do that, and we have given sufficient time and planning to the sector to respond. It is not going to be easy, and we will need to give them, as a sector, time to be able to address. But if I have not been clear enough, let me say it again: we are not relaxing any issues around schools at present, nor is that imminent.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Suzy, I think we can try going to you again now.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you. Minister, in your consideration of introducing a phased return to school, in due course, have you taken into consideration how things like school absences are going to be managed? Because, regardless of the amount of good work you do on messaging, there will still be some families that don't realise that going back to school is for their particular family. Will there be a relaxation of, effectively, what we would call truancy rules? Or is that something that schools will be getting guidance on much up-front?\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you, Suzy. As I said in my statement earlier today, returning to school will not be a return to normal, and in recognition of this, I've already made it clear that I will seek, in all opportunities, to reduce the burdens on school. That includes various data collection, the suspension of performance measures and removing the requirement to undertake literacy and numeracy testing, and, clearly, school attendance will want to be an important factor of that.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. I'm keen to go on now to talk about the current situation as being faced by our children and young people in schools with some questions from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Si\u00e2n.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Since yesterday, the Welsh Government has started publishing data on the number of schools that are open, the number of children attending those schools, and the number of staff involved, and they have been making this information available as per capita of the population. On average, I think it's 1 per cent of the children of Wales that actually attend these locations, and some 5 per cent of the staff. So, can you analyse those figures a little further? Can you tell us how many children, according to this data, are children of key workers, and how many are vulnerable children?\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you very much, Si\u00e2n. As you quite rightly say, on average, we have 518 school hubs open each day, with up to 4,200 children attending. We have seen an increase in the number of attendances since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term. We have approximately 5.6 per cent of the teaching population working in those hubs, and at present, 85 per cent of the children who are attending are the children of key workers, the remainder being vulnerable children. So, we are now averaging 600 vulnerable children per day. These are small numbers, but we have seen an increase in those numbers since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. I'm sure we'll return to that point a little later on. How much confidence do you therefore have that the arrangements are effective in terms of the safety of staff and children at these locations?\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you once again for that. The smooth operation of the hubs, with regard to health and safety, is, of course, of paramount importance. What we have seen since schools closed for traditional statutory purposes and moving to their repurposed function\u2014we have seen a change of pattern over time. So, following my announcement on, I believe, 18 March, the week after, we saw a large number of settings open and operating. As local authorities have been able to understand the demand for those places\u2014from critical workers and vulnerable children\u2014we have seen more local authorities move to a hub model, and we have been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed, and we've been able to give guidance in that regard. Local authorities are asked by us to report any incidents where they are concerned about operation issues on the ground.\nSian Gwenllian AM:As I mentioned earlier, testing is crucially important in dealing with this crisis. So, how many school staff have been tested for COVID because they may have experienced symptoms and so on? And how many of those have tested positive?\nKirsty Williams AM:My understanding from Public Health Wales is that 15 teachers have been tested for COVID-19, and I believe two of those results have come back as positive. Can I make it absolutely clear, the week before last, Welsh Government issued new guidance around who should be tested? I want to make it absolutely clear to those professionals working in our hubs, if they or a member of their family are exhibiting any of the symptoms, however mild, of COVID-19, they can and they should be tested.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. And the final question from me on this: how important is testing going to be in this next phase, as you start to think about relaxing restrictions?\nKirsty Williams AM:Obviously, the ability to be able to test, to trace and to quarantine will be critical to the next phase and will be a very, very important and significant building block in all aspects of the Government's work to respond to this pandemic.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you, Minister, and thank you, Si\u00e2n. We've got some questions now on the impact on particular groups of children, from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. Just following on from your answer to Si\u00e2n Gwenllian earlier about the number of vulnerable children in school, what's being done specifically to facilitate more of those children coming into a school setting or hub at the moment? I'm thinking about the 600 you've talked about, and I know, in one of my local authority areas of Merthyr, which is a very small authority, we're talking about the number of children identified as vulnerable running into thousands, not hundreds, and that's just in one authority. So, this is a particularly difficult issue to address, I appreciate, but how are we going to get more of these children into the hubs?\nKirsty Williams AM:Okay, Dawn. The first thing to say is that the issue of vulnerable children attending settings is one that is a challenge to not just Wales, but also to my colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. I'm pleased to say that we are working across Government departments\u2014myself, obviously, and colleagues in education\u2014with colleagues in social services to have a cross-Government approach to these issues. I think the first thing to say is that these are complex messages, because the overriding public health message from our Government has been to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible, and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly, safely and effectively, we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs. So, firstly, the fact that numbers are small is in some ways a success of our public health messages, because parents have been heeding those messages, but, of course, all of us will have concerns for some children who remain at home. So, I'm pleased to say that we have seen a doubling in the last week of the number of children. So, although numbers are small, they have doubled over the course of the last week. We're working with local authorities and they have assured us that children and young people with a social worker have been risk assessed on a multi-agency basis and are receiving support in a number of ways, and that includes having conversations about some of those children attending the hubs. They're also looking to support in other ways. Of course, some of our children who would be classed as vulnerable\u2014and our definition of 'vulnerable' is one that is shared between the systems in England and Wales\u2014could be children with a statement of special educational needs. For some of those children who, perhaps, have very intense health needs, actually, staying at home is the appropriate thing for that child and that family to do, and we're looking to support families, and local authorities and local education systems are looking to support families, in a number of ways. We also know that just because you don't have a social worker or a statement of special educational needs does not mean that a child may not be vulnerable, and schools are very aware of the needs of those children and have been carrying out regular telephone check-ins where they can\u2014if the age of the child is appropriate\u2014just to keep in touch with those families and those individual children. But we will continue to work across Government to encourage, where it is appropriate, children to attend settings, and, if it is not appropriate for children to be in a setting, that there is contact with those children and young people to ensure that they remain, and their families remain, supported.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Minister. It's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and I assume, within that, appropriate referral mechanisms are still in place if teachers or anybody has any particular concern about a child. Similarly, with special educational needs, whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school, and they may not respond as well to remote working, or remote contact, with an SEN advisor, are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, first of all, Dawn, you're absolutely right: my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children, and schools should continue to refer children to children's services if they have any concerns, and that would also, of course, be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children. So, there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that, despite the circumstances they find themselves in, they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child's welfare and safety. With regard to children with additional learning needs, I am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children, and perhaps Steve Davies could give some further details. We have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision, where that is appropriate\u2014so, if I could give you an example of my own local authority in Powys, they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs, and those centres are available\u2014recognising, however, that, even with the provision of specialist hubs, it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine. Hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with. So, even when local authorities\u2014and the vast, vast majority of them do\u2014have specialist services in place, sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child's health and well-being. But perhaps Steve can give us further details of the conversations that have been taking place with directors of education to ensure that children with additional learning needs have access to the hubs and specialist support. Steve.\nSteve Davies:Yes, myself and colleague Albert Heaney\u2014colleague-director\u2014have been in regular touch with directors of education and directors of social services to make sure that these children and young people's needs are catered for. We are very aware of all of the special schools\u2014profound and multiple learning difficulties, EBD schools and pupil referral units\u2014that have been kept open in their own way, but also, in some cases, as hubs, to deliver those services for those children's needs, and we're pleased that the directors and the local authorities have responded so constructively. So, we have the details of every school that's open, the pupils who are attending, and we are clear that the risk assessments that the Minister referred to for children with special needs, as well as wider vulnerable groups\u2014they are having risk assessments to make sure that, where there is a need identified for a pupil that is not currently attending a hub, then the local authority can be working with that child and with the parents.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you, Steve. Dawn.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you. Just two more questions. One is around emotional and mental health difficulties being experienced by children and young people at the moment. Now, there was a very welcome announcement of \u00a31.25 million pounds for school counselling. How is that, in practical terms, being applied if those children are not actually in school?\nKirsty Williams AM:You're right, Dawn: we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time, but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and well-being\u2014recognising, of course, it is absolutely natural for all of us, including children and young people, to have fears and anxieties at this time. That's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in. But, of course, there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling, and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support. So, the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families. In the immediacy, of course, that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we've traditionally delivered services in the past, because of social distancing and lockdown rules, but we want to get some of these systems in place now, rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal. We need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now, but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services. So, we've been in close touch with local authorities, asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources, and we've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them.\nDawn Bowden AM:So, that would include things like telephone and video support as well, I guess, then.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, absolutely. So, that would include remote counselling as in a fashion that we're doing now, but also, as and when some of the restrictions are perhaps removed, looking at an enhanced family therapy, or a therapy approach. So, when we talk about counselling, I think it's important to recognise that there will be some flexibility around this money and it does not necessarily mean that local authorities have to use it on a one-to-one basis. That might not be appropriate for some children, especially our younger children and their families, and they can use that money to provide counselling or therapy\u2014in the widest possible terms\u2014that is the best method to support individual children and their families. But, clearly, we're having to do that in the confines of lockdown and social distancing at the moment. Some of that money can also be used to support the professional learning and the professional development of counsellors, because, of course, they may be being asked to work in a different way and we need to make sure that they have the appropriate skills and abilities to do that.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you. Thank you, Minister.\nLynne Neagle AM:Dawn, before you ask your final question, I've got a couple of supplementaries\u2014firstly from Suzy, and then from Hefin.\nSuzy Davies AM:Oh, thank you. My question goes back to the comment you made earlier, Minister, about the number of children doubling\u2014sorry, vulnerable children doubling\u2014after the Easter break, if we can call it that. So, what I'm after is a sense of churn in these establishments. So, was that figure a recovery of a number of children that had been there before the Easter break, and are the people who are there still the same people as were there right at the beginning of the crisis and the lockdown?\nKirsty Williams AM:Suzy, what I believe that we're seeing in our schools is new pupils coming into school. So, there has been, I know, a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children, and to be able to give them the confidence that there are\u2014that the hubs are available for them. So, we have seen an increase in children. Those numbers are still small and, I believe, potentially, there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children, whether that\u2014. That vulnerability, of course, can cover a whole range of issues. As I said when we last met, this is a constantly evolving situation. The initial response\u2014local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs. We've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and I am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Hefin, you had a supplementary\u2014briefly, please.\nHefin David AM:Yes, very quickly. I've been listening to the answers with regard to vulnerable children, following on from that answer. I'm at home with a vulnerable child\u2014a child who has got additional learning needs. She's got autism; she's four. I imagine there are many, many parents in exactly the same position\u2014I've heard from them. I haven't heard anything from the school or from the local authority. Should I have heard something or should I be proactive in pursuing it?\nKirsty Williams AM:I don't want to comment on personal cases\u2014\nHefin David AM:But there are many others in this position.\nKirsty Williams AM:\u2014but what I would say is that if parents have concerns and want to have a conversation about what support is available to them and their children, they should contact their local education authority to have a conversation as to what support is available.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Dawn, final question, please.\nDawn Bowden AM:Yes, my last question is really about the potential for the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers. Is that a concern for you? I'm thinking particularly in relation to those less affluent families in having access to technology and so on. What kind of concerns do you have about that and what are we looking to do to try to ensure that that doesn't actually play out?\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you, Dawn. All of the statistics would tell us that learning loss and the gap, potentially, will affect those more vulnerable children the most. Clearly, we will want to consider that as we think about what the new normal for education may look like, or as we develop into future phases. Depending on where that child is in their educational journey, of course, the needs and the potential for loss are slightly different. So, for instance, when we're thinking about very young children, we could be thinking about a lack of social interaction and the development of oracy skills. Of course, that, potentially, then will have a knock-on to their ability to learn to read and then to write, for instance. For other children who are, perhaps, older and heading towards formal examinations, the challenge when they return to school will be a slightly different one. I'm not sure, Chair, whether you want me to give some further details about our continuity-of-learning plan and how we are looking to address digital disadvantage now, or whether there are questions later.\nLynne Neagle AM:Well, I've got a question on that coming up, so, if it's okay, Dawn, we'll go on to that now. Before we do that, I was just going to ask how the Welsh Government is paying due regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and, obviously, the right children and young people have to an education. I was going to ask you about the risk of inequality due to varying access to digital resources, which are so important in ensuring continuity of learning.\nKirsty Williams AM:You're absolutely correct, Chair. Officials are very aware of our responsibilities towards children's rights in this regard and we are doing whatever we can to ensure that children have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time. We are fortunate in the regard that, because of previous decisions and investments, we have a strong base on which to build because we have our Hwb digital learning platform and because we have invested heavily in the national purchasing of Microsoft Office and Google for Education tools, which are available to all families. We have become the first, I think\u2014we're certainly the first in the UK, and I'm not sure whether we're the first across the world, but I think we probably are\u2014to deploy, for instance, Adobe Spark nationally. But, obviously, access to hardware and connectivity is crucial at this time. Officials are working with local authorities to ensure that all children have access to both the hardware and the connectivity they need to be able to participate in digital learning at this particular time.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Just a final question from me: how exactly are we communicating to parents what the expectations are of them in terms of delivering this education at home now? Are there, for example, guidelines on recommended hours of home learning per day of the week or volume of work to be completed? How are we ensuring that parents know how best to lead their children through this at the moment?\nKirsty Williams AM:Firstly, can I recognise what a challenge this is? We've just heard from Hefin who is carrying on his day job as the Assembly Member, but is obviously trying to do that as well as care for and provide learning for his children, and I know, Chair, that you're doing the same, and I'm certainly trying to do the same, and it's a real challenge, it's not easy. As part of our 'Stay Safe. Stay Learning' policy statement, advice is available to parents and carers on the Hwb platform as to what they best can do to support their children. I think the really important message that I've been trying to give to parents is not to be too hard on ourselves. I know that everybody is doing the best that they can in really challenging circumstances. And if they have concerns, they should be in contact with their child's school, but we do have specific advice and guidance to parents on the Hwb platform.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. We're going to move on now to some questions on examinations from Janet Finch-Saunders. Janet, we can't hear you. I tell you what, we'll\u2014. Janet, do you want to try again? No. Okay, we'll go on then to questions on higher education and post 16, and we'll come back to examinations, if that's okay. Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, thank you, Chair. Before we leave continuity of learning, do you mind if I just ask this one question?\nLynne Neagle AM:No, that's fine. Yes, go on.\nSuzy Davies AM:Your comment, Minister, on working with local authorities to make sure that individuals have hardware: can you just give us a bit of detail on what working with local authorities actually means? In the process of that, is there any data gathering going on for those pupils who are being educated at home and the levels at which they're engaging? You know, are they sticking with it, or how many are dropping out? Because I think the two of those perhaps go together.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, absolutely. So, I'm hoping to make an announcement tomorrow, if not later on this week, about some specific details around support for hardware and connectivity. We're working closely with local authorities to understand just that: to understand from the schools the number of schools that\u2014and a number of them have already done this\u2014have been lending Chromebooks, iPads and laptops to children, and also identifying children who are not perhaps engaging in the activities that have been made available. And we'll be doing two things to support local authorities. The first is to use the stock of equipment that they already have to be able to provide hardware to students. So, we have purchased on a national basis software that, when applied to an old piece of kit, essentially turns it into an out-of-the-box Chromebook. Because, as you can imagine, just like other things during a pandemic, there has been a rush to buy new stuff on the market and then there is a scramble and nobody can get what they need. So, we're utilisng kit that is already available in schools and local authorities, and we will look to backfill that to schools at a later point out of our EdTech investment programme. The other issue is, once a child has a Chromebook or a laptop or a device, issues around connectivity. So, we're also looking to purchase on a national level and distribute Mi-Fi connectivity, so students will be able to have access to Wi-Fi where they don't have that already. That's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff gets to the right children. One of the ways in which we are able to do that is to look at engagement in education. So, if a child hasn't been engaging, is that because they just don't want to and they're voting with their feet\u2014but clearly teachers need to have a conversation about that\u2014or is that because the child simply does not have the ability to do that, and therefore we need to get that stuff out to those children? So, rather than just simply leaving it to local authorities to scramble around in a very crowded market to get the stuff that they will need, we're trying to do that on a national basis and deploy that to local authorities. So, our officials have been having conversations with each of our local authorities to ascertain what's already happened, and there is very good practice out there\u2014schools have been proactive\u2014but where there are gaps, what can we do as a national Government to be able to assist them to do that? We are repurposing some of the resources that we had previously identified for our EdTech investment, using those resources to fill this particular gap.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. We're going to go back to Janet now. I believe we've got sound again, so Janet can ask her questions on examinations. Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. I thought it was something at this end; I'm glad to hear it wasn't. When will vocational learners know what is happening with their assessments, and how will those who have no choice but to wait for a vocational assessment be supported?\nKirsty Williams AM:Okay. That's a very good question, Janet, because I know that there has been some concern and anxiety around vocational qualification students and how quickly we've been able to provide certainty for them. You'll be aware that Qualifications Wales have been able, in the last week, to be able to give that greater clarity. So, they have announced that learners due to complete their Essential Skills Wales qualifications will receive results. They have also published their approach to how health and social care qualifications will be managed, because, of course, those are part of the first set of reformed quals that we have done on a Wales basis. You are right, there are a group of students who fall into the category where there are technical qualifications that require a certificate of competency to be industry ready\u2014I hope I've explained that correctly\u2014and, therefore, we are working to understand how we can accommodate those students in these particular circumstances. But, at this stage, there may be some delay for that element of their qualification being delayed to a further date.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Yes. What are your expectations for how A-level and GCSE qualifications will be awarded this summer, following the ministerial direction that you have issued to Qualifications Wales? For example, how is an appropriate balance being taken between recognising the progress of pupils in their coursework, mock examinations, and other work to date, and also, the potential of pupils who might have performed particularly well in their examinations this summer?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, Janet, I understand\u2014and today is a day where some students would have been undertaking practical examinations\u2014I understand how devastating it has been to both students and teachers alike for the decision I had to take to cancel this summer's exam series. But I'm absolutely clear that was the only decision that could have been reached. Qualifications Wales has made it very clear\u2014and for people who would like more information, I would urge them to look at Qualifications Wales's website\u2014how they will go about giving, allocating, and awarding a grade to our A-level and GCSE students. Firstly, teachers will be asked to submit a grade they believe that student would have obtained, should they have taken an exam. And, of course, teachers will have a range of data and their own professional judgment that they will use in awarding that grade. Teachers will also be asked to rank students in order. Once that information has been submitted to Qualifications Wales, there will be a process by which that data will be moderated; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation, thus giving us the chance to award a student a fair grade whilst being, and remaining, true to ensuring that we have a robust qualifications system, and allowing those students who find themselves at a critical stage of their education, where they are looking to move on to the next stages\u2014that they will have the grades that will allow them to make decisions about their future.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you, Janet. We're going to go on now, then, to the questions on higher and further education from Suzy Davies. Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you, Chair. I suppose my first question just goes back to the 16-year-olds at the moment and those who are looking forward to either going to college, the older ones going to university, there'll be apprenticeships, all kinds of future pathways for post 16. What's happening at school level, or even at college level, to get those students ready for the next steps, because, obviously, they're not in their usual environments and getting their usual programme of teaching?\nKirsty Williams AM:No, that's quite right, Suzy, and I should have said in answer to Janet's question, as well\u2014I'm sure people already know, but just to get the point across\u2014that A-level results day and GCSE day will run as normal across not just Wales, but England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is really important. You're right, Suzy\u2014for those people that are coming to the end of one part of their education this is a particularly challenging time. You'll be aware that, last week, on Hwb, we were able to launch a programme for year 13 students to help them get ready for university. I'm very grateful to the HE sector in Wales, who've worked really hard with us on that. So, for instance, if you were a year 13 student or even a year 12 student that was thinking about or interested in areas around social policy, you could have tuned into a social policy lecturer at Swansea University. If you go to the Hwb website, you will be able to see that there are subject listings, everything from animal science through to law, politics, history and science, with links through to higher education and further education courses that students can avail themselves of. There's also a section on preparation for essential study skills, whether that is report writing or academic writing. So, there is a range of activities and courses available for year 13, so that children\u2014'children'; they're all children to me\u2014young people can get themselves\u2014. They don't have to stop learning, and they can get themselves ready for the next stage of their education. Again, for those children, perhaps, who are coming to the end of their GCSEs, there is a range of information, either within their own schools or within their local colleges about things that can keep them learning. So, for instance, I'm aware of one school where you can go onto the website and there are recommendations of, for instance, what you could be reading over the summer if you're interested in doing this particular A-level in September. I know that there are also moves in schools and in colleges to be able to make sure that those children don't miss out on really important careers advice at this time, as well, and information, so they can make informed decisions. I know that people are working hard to link up children to advice services that are available so that they can make those really important future decisions with the advice of either a teacher or other professional so that they've got those options. So, there is material out there and it's growing all the time. This week, we were able to launch our virtual Seren network. You'll be aware that, for the last couple of years, we've been able to send Welsh children to the Yale global summer school. Clearly, that can't happen this year. That's devastating for those year 12s who had worked so hard and had won a place on that programme. They will now be able to attend the Yale global scholars programme virtually and remotely, because Yale have moved that programme online. So, we're developing materials and resources all of the time.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you for that answer. Before I move on to my next question, can you give me some sort of sense of how that Hwb\u00a0domain is being populated? Where is all this information being sourced from? Presumably, they'll be working with partners, but what does that look like?\nKirsty Williams AM:Oh, my goodness. Yes, absolutely\u2014\nSuzy Davies AM:[Inaudible.]\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, we're working very hard. So, everything from our work with the BBC, for instance, and BBC Bitesize through to our FE colleges and our HE institutions, as well as other organisations in the third sector who are looking to provide those opportunities. Can I just say that, last week, we were looking at, every day, in the region of well over 150,000 logins a day into Hwb?\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, that's great. So there's proactive populating of Hwb. That's what I was after. That's great. Just going back to some of Janet's questions and the assessed grades, I want to talk to you about the unconditional offers and where we are with that at the moment for entry to universities, because there's going to be a scramble now of the available students for further education, but primarily higher education institutions, across the UK. Is the moratorium on unconditional offers still standing? Are there conversations going on to extend that moratorium? Otherwise, this scramble is going to potentially negatively affect our universities quite considerably.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, you'll be aware that a moratorium does exist. It exists in this current context to 1 May. We continue to keep in close touch with colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland and in the Westminster Government around these issues. Officials are also in touch with UCAS, and in the last couple of days I've had at least three meetings with representatives of the Welsh higher education sector to discuss these matters.\nSuzy Davies AM:I just want to ask you now about students and their maintenance loan grants. I think they're getting, around now, the money going into their bank account that they would normally have expected at this time of year. That's right, yes?\nKirsty Williams AM:That's correct, yes.\nSuzy Davies AM:What's happening to those students who would normally be living in digs somewhere but are now living at home? Are they likely to be asked to reimburse part of the cost, because obviously it's not as expensive to live at home as away, and what's likely to be happening with the maintenance loans over the summer holiday period, potentially? Because we've had a period now where students can't top up their maintenance loans by going out and working on weekends or working in the evenings, or whatever, so their income has been impacted. Just in the round, what kind of conversations are happening around that? Again, it's probably a four-nation approach, I would imagine.\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you, Suzy. You are correct to say that our student support regime does allow for a lower payment to be made to those students that stay at home during their studies, but I want to reassure students that there will be no change to their student support payments just because they have left their universities and have decided to go home. There should be no change. Also, we are continuing, it should be important to say, to pay education maintenance allowance at this time for our FE students that are eligible for that, even though, obviously, for EMA there is an attendance requirement, but clearly that is not appropriate to enforce at the moment. You are correct\u2014this is a worrying time for many students in higher education, especially for those who are looking to graduate at this time and are going out into an economy that has been tremendously badly hit by the pandemic. At this time, we continue to have conversations with NUS Wales about what can be done within a Welsh context, but, as you quite rightly say, also within a UK context, to support students who may have been affected. We are continuing\u2014on our webpage we have a frequently asked questions section that advises students in the first instance, especially when it comes, for instance, to the cost of accommodation\u2014to have those discussions, and I'm very grateful that, in some cases, some of our institutions have been able to waive or partially waive accommodation fees where students have vacated their accommodation and have returned to their usual home address. But we will continue to have dialogue with NUS Wales and with our counterparts across the country to look to see what more we can do to support students at this time.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you for that answer, and, yes, I was pleased to see that announcement through the NUS as well, so well done to those accommodation providers who have a heart. I think we'll all have seen the Universities UK document that explains some of the difficulties that they're going to be running into if this proceeds much further. My understanding is that the main emphasis at the moment is to try and get all the universities across the UK through this initial period of difficulty by releasing as much money as possible. I can see that your figure to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was a little bit down on last year's letter\u2014not that there's been a remit letter yet, but an indication. Are you releasing that money earlier so that they can use it more swiftly, or does that not matter?\nLynne Neagle AM:Before you come in, Minister, that is going to have to be the last question, just to make you aware of that, because we are coming up to the end of our time.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. That's fine.\nKirsty Williams AM:Of course, Suzy, we are working closely with Universities Wales and have a lot of sympathy for the proposals that have come forward from Universities UK, which Wales's universities have been a part of forming. Stability in the first instance is really important to us, which is why we've been able to give an indication to HEFCW about resources that are available, and we've been very clear to HEFCW that we want to be as flexible as possible in how they use those resources to support institutions. That potentially would mean reprofiling the way in which money gets out to institutions, but clearly we will need to have an ongoing discussion about how we respond to the immediacy of the issues facing HE, how we can get stability for the next academic year, and how we then can support the sector through what is a really challenging time for them. We will do that in a Welsh context and we will continue to do that also in a UK context, because you will have seen the scale of some of the figures that have been talked about in terms of the impact on the HE sector at this time. Clearly, a four-nation approach to that will be crucial.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. Well, we have come to the end of our time, and, as to anything that we didn't ask, we will have to write to the Minister. Can I just thank the Minister and her officials for your attendance today? We know how busy you are dealing with the pandemic and we very much welcome this opportunity to have this discussion with you. So, thank you, Minister and officials for your time. As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nKirsty Williams AM:Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. I see that Members are content, so we will now proceed to meet in private.\n",
        "summary": "The meeting with the Welsh Government is mainly about the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales. To start with, Kirsty Williams AM indicated that still there was not an exact date schools might reopen. Students could only return to school in the safe environment, which required the lead from scientific and medical advisers. Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams AM emphasized that the government would not relax any of the restrictions with regard to education and new measuring methods would be applied concerning performance rate, etc. It was suggested that there was an increase in the number of attendances to the open hubs and the ability to test, to trace and to quarantine would be critical to the next phase. Moreover, the meeting agreed that schools should remain in contact with children in need and continue to identify vulnerable children with emotional and mental health difficulties. Also, methods to assure sustainable higher education would be applied and vocational qualification students would fear none. Last but not least, although the education cost for students receiving support regime would decrease, there would be no change on the allowance.",

        "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Si\u00e2n today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. Thank you all for coming. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. Minister, I understand you wanted to make an opening statement today.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, if that's okay, Chair. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. Dealing with the impacts of this pandemic is extremely challenging. Things are changing on an hourly basis, and we have to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. But we also have a duty to ensure continuing and continuity of education. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. This includes all of those who benefit from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb\u00a0digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. Diolch yn fawr.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you very much, Minister, for that statement. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. So, thank you for what you've been doing. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. You've talked about the children of key workers, free school meals, additional learning needs. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas?\nKirsty Williams AM:Thank you, Dawn. So, you're\u00a0absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. So, those conversations began a few days ago. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could\u2014? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. Steve.\nSteve Davies:In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. The second area is looking at how we support the children of key workers. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday\u2014I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. So, schools have identified the number of children with health workers. It will grow, and we will need to look at that range. Then, the third area is vulnerable children. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities\u2014some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently\u2014I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said.\nDawn Bowden AM:Those that have been identified. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. They would be included.\nSteve Davies:Yes, definitely. Vulnerable children, yes.\nKirsty Williams AM:In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs.\nSteve Davies:I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. I've got a supplementary from Hefin, and then Suzy.\nHefin David AM:A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The Welsh Government have a route to communication. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents?\nKirsty Williams AM:We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. Welsh Government already has a dedicated website page with all of the relevant information about coronavirus. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. Understandably, people are communicating to us on Twitter asking questions. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying, 'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.' So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. And, as I said, Hefin, will it be perfect on Monday? No. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. But we will continue to build that resilience. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. But that public health advice may change. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. So, I hope people will understand that we are working in those kinds of scenarios.\nLynne Neagle AM:Suzy, you had a supplementary.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services' care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need.\nKirsty Williams AM:We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. We will put no constraints on those teachers trying to do that work.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM:We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange, 'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.' My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. We're trying to create a system that will run uniformly. That's our policy goal at the moment.\nLynne Neagle AM:Helen Mary.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group\u2014and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people\u2014is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the\u2014. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time.\nKirsty Williams AM:We will certainly raise those issues. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. One of the reasons why schools are closing is to help manage this disease. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. Rob is the expert on that, not me.\nRob Orford:Yes, absolutely. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. Next week, I think, will look different to this week. So, it kind of is what it is. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. Areas that we're worried about are displacement activities. If we close the schools, then people collect at others' houses. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. The more that we can do that, the easier it will be when we go forward.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad\u2014. It may be very important for those children to be out of that for some of the time. Hopefully, we're talking about relatively small numbers, but I just\u2014.\nKirsty Williams AM:We will look at vulnerability in a holistic way.\nLynne Neagle AM:Janet, you had a supplementary.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses.\nLynne Neagle AM:Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. Dawn.\nDawn Bowden AM:Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this\u2014and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that\u2014the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to that?' Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff?\nSteve Davies:Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation\u2014and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear\u2014is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing.\nDawn Bowden AM:So, would you anticipate\u2014again, I know this is all a bit 'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable\u2014that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. Would that possibly\u2014?\nKirsty Williams AM:That is a potential. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. So, that could well\u2014. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. But that's not for us to dictate. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. There may be cultural officers that can have something to offer. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. We want to give parents, who we are asking\u2014. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job.\nLynne Neagle AM:Just before you\u2014. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings?\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose\u2014you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible.]\u2014mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next\u2014? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work?\nLynne Neagle AM:We've covered that, Janet.\nKirsty Williams AM:First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. That's really, really kind of you. We will be sending a letter today to clarify those positions. So, each school will receive letters today about the expectations of schools next week.\nLynne Neagle AM:I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think\u2014?\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:No, I heard that loud and clear.\nLynne Neagle AM:But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. So, I'm sorry about that; we are having some problems with the connection.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Yes, we couldn't get a signal.\nLynne Neagle AM:Dawn.\nDawn Bowden AM:Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, they're absolutely central to that planning. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. Therefore, the same situation that we've just described for maintained schools also applies to special schools. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. In some cases, that may not be possible. So, again, already local authorities are making different provision. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. But, again, Steve can give more detail.\nSteve Davies:I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. So, we would expect that to function with the focus on vulnerable children. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we\u2019ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school.\nDawn Bowden AM:Just a couple more questions from me. It\u2019s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Some schools have already partially closed. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that\u2019s the right thing to do?\nKirsty Williams AM:In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about.\nSteve Davies:The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future.\nDawn Bowden AM:We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again?\nKirsty Williams AM:If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. And my final question is in relation to the position of early years and childcare settings. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage?\nKirsty Williams AM:Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses\u2014people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. So, that payment will be made, regardless of whether a child is attending. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates.\nLynne Neagle AM:Hefin, then Janet.\nHefin David AM:Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents' point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. That's being kept under constant review on public health. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially\u2014and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan.\nLynne Neagle AM:Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Is this the Cylch question?\nLynne Neagle AM:Yes, please.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Sorry, thank you. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns\u2014[Interruption.]\nLynne Neagle AM:We've lost Janet. We'll come back to her.\nKirsty Williams AM:I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014 around service-level agreements are off. I'm not setting the precedent\u2014let me make that absolutely clear. [Laughter.] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. I hope I've been clear.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you for that.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you, Kirsty.\nLynne Neagle AM:If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams?\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. I met with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC yesterday. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Janet, you had a question on this.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me\u2014do you have any advice for them?\nKirsty Williams AM:Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade\u2014I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Because we've kept our AS-levels, we have got that data. Because we have a GCSE system\u2014. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. And I think that's really important. We\u2019re starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. So, they can have real confidence.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Helen Mary.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Thank you. A supplementary question that might feed into that moderation. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. I don't know what their evidence is for that. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason\u00a0that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. So, you're quite right. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. Dare I say it, some might even have done early entry. So, we still have elements of coursework that are externally verified. So, children might well have done lots of oral exams in their English and in their Welsh language. So, we have lots of pieces of work that will have been externally verified. I certainly will ensure that these concerns are passed on. I'm sure that Qualifications Wales are thinking about it. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM:A few things from me. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me\u2014 because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working\u2014how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well\u2014your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning\u2014which is due to be examined within three weeks. Those aren\u2019t A-levels or GCSEs. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess?\nKirsty Williams AM:With regard to\u00a0AS-levels\u2014no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies\u2014they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board\u2014and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications.\nHuw Morris:No. I think you've covered most of it. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you.\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. And homeworking\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM:Homeworking, right.\nSuzy Davies AM:\u2014is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, potentially, as I said. I don't know the exact elements. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades.\nSuzy Davies AM:That's great. At least we covered it. Thank you, Minister\u2014thank you, Kirsty.\nLynne Neagle AM:And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward\u2014content to accept students on this basis?\nKirsty Williams AM:Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. One of the\u2014. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw?\nHuw Morris:Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. Well, it's a very general question, really. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions\u2014a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector.\nSuzy Davies AM:I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet.\nKirsty Williams AM:Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.\nHuw Morris:No\u2014just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students.\nSuzy Davies AM:And there's still this safety net idea. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis.\nHuw Morris:That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions.\nSuzy Davies AM:That's fair enough. And, presumably, education maintenance allowance will still be paid.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes. Arrangements have been made to ensure that EMA continues to be paid to all students who are entitled.\nSuzy Davies AM:That's right. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are\u2014in your portfolio.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes. I'm doing my best, but it's an absolute yes on the EMA. There will be no disruption to EMA.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. You might get some further questions on HE and FE.\nLynne Neagle AM:Yes. We've got some further questions, indeed, from Helen Mary and then Hefin.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Now or in a bit?\nLynne Neagle AM:Yes.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore?\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention?\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:That's really good to hear. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment?\nKirsty Williams AM:Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. As I said, we anticipate no disruption to\u2014. We don't anticipate any change in the approach to students as a result of this. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home\u2014\nKirsty Williams AM:It is their home.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:\u2014overseas students, for example. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students' basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need?\nKirsty Williams AM:Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that.\nHuw Morris:We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:That's really helpful. And on this specifically\u2014last question from me\u2014 have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed?\nHuw Morris:So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. The intention in all of these institutions is that they will complete their course of study. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Suzy, you had a supplementary.\nSuzy Davies AM:No, Mr Morris has answered my question.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. We've got a couple more questions now on vulnerable learners. I've got Helen Mary, then Hefin.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:I think, Chair, the Minister has already answered what the\u2014. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone?\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure\u2014which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at\u2014we would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff, for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people\u00a0a range of online facilities that are available\u2014so, for instance, Meic website\u2014so, looking to use a variety of platforms. We do, of course, have the formal NHS counselling services. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is\u00a0via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists\u2014online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. I think we have to remember that this is a really worrying time for children and young people. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible\u2014and teachers have been working so hard to do that\u2014is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands' and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Can I just\u2014? Just a supplementary to that\u2014you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time?\nKirsty Williams AM:No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Because it's not safe.\nKirsty Williams AM:\u2014because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying, 'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.'\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:That will make a lot of people happy, thank you. [Laughter.]\nKirsty Williams AM:As I said, we are facing unprecedented circumstances. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. Our call to the youth service is a call to arms, though. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services\u2014. Many of our youth services work on an outreach basis. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier.\nHelen Mary Jones AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation.\nHefin David AM:All right. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals\u2014if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point?\nKirsty Williams AM:I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I will have to check that, Hefin, to be honest. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't\u2014\nHefin David AM:Can we have a clear line on that?\nKirsty Williams AM:We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Final question\u2014because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with\u2014from Suzy on emergency legislation.\nSuzy Davies AM:I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be?\nKirsty Williams AM:Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction\u2014so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open\u2014and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. So, obviously, we have rules around the level of nutrition that schools should be giving their children. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities\u2014to be able to suspend things, direct things\u2014that we would not normally have in normal circumstances.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. And just to finish this one off\u2014you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness\u2014in those situations where it's the Government who says 'no' to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely?\nKirsty Williams AM:I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. So, the insurance industry is not my area of expertise.\nSuzy Davies AM:No, no, I accept that.\nKirsty Williams AM:It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this\u2014it feels like an awfully long time ago now\u2014 you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. This is helpful to know, actually.\nKirsty Williams AM:So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago.\nSuzy Davies AM:I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked.\nKirsty Williams AM:Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise.\nSuzy Davies AM:No, but thank you for answering.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you again, all of you, for your attendance. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Thank you.\n",
        "summary": "Basically, the Children, Young People and Education Committee's meeting was about the current situations and policies regarding schools, students and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dealing with this pandemic was extremely challenging and the government had to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. The main concern as the education Minister was to protect all staff and pupils in schools and other educational settings. Their belief was that no child shall miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. From next week, schools would have a new proposal which would help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak. The key was that they were looking at supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning, which included all of those who benefited from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. What they needed to do now was to do all the work together as they were facing the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Good morning everybody .\nIndustrial Designer:Good morning .\nProject Manager:Oh , everybody is not ready .\nUser Interface:Uh almost .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:Ready .\nProject Manager:Okay , let's go . So , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes . Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager . Um you are the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I'm uh Michael . I'm the user interface designer .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Hi I'm Guillermo {gap} . I'm the Marketing Expert .\nIndustrial Designer:And I am Hemant , the industrial designer .\nProject Manager:Okay , very good . Thanks for being here . Um so let's have a look to the the agenda . So , we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh {vocalsound} to make {disfmarker} to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . As usual we will follow the the project method um {vocalsound} that we are using in the {disfmarker} in our company . It is in three step as you know . First the functional design . The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings . So who want to start ? Mister {gap} .\nUser Interface:Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Let's see . Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um\nProject Manager:You have one in mind ?\nUser Interface:uh I think I have one in mind , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm gonna {vocalsound} {gap} about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . The spider has a {disfmarker} spider lives in a web {vocalsound} and uh it has eight legs , and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . There are some spiders that live in like {disfmarker} that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh {disfmarker} build a new web somewhere else . So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh {disfmarker} well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So , that's my animal .\nProject Manager:Th thank you . Very interesting . {vocalsound} Guillermo you want to ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} 'kay {vocalsound} I dunno why , but {vocalsound} when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} not a pink panther ,\nIndustrial Designer:But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ?\nMarketing:or maybe yes .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It would be very funny for us .\nMarketing:Uh yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So bad I don't like it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay it's a friendly panther .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone .\nMarketing:Yeah maybe {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um . Actually , honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour , I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh , I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , so {disfmarker} but {vocalsound} I like it because it's fast , and it's black as well , so it can he {disfmarker} it can hide itself very easily and it's it's {disfmarker} it looks like um {vocalsound} powerful , strong , uh I dunno . I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and {vocalsound} I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Thank you .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Hemant .\nIndustrial Designer:Um sure .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So you don't like pink panthers ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I like it {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{gap} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah . Thanks . This lapel is coming out once in a while . It's not very strong . Okay . So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll try to draw elephant {vocalsound} . It's a problem . Okay , thanks . Okay so , elephant goes like this , {gap} and then it has four feet {vocalsound} . I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but I think this is the easiest . And then we have it's trunk . And yep something like this {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:An eye , cute {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Poor elephant {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} and sometimes they have a hump . It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way {disfmarker} a different way of walking . So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . That's the way they walk . And that's very peculiar about them . None of the other animals walk like this . And they are very useful to human beings . At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . And they are found in um usually the warm countries . And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . That's what I know about them . So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants .\nUser Interface:So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ?\nIndustrial Designer:There are two kind of uh yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are Indian and {disfmarker} So at some {disfmarker} for some elephants it's {disfmarker} the trunk is having one {disfmarker} Do we have some message there ?\nProject Manager:Yes . We have to {disfmarker} I have to catch you ,\nIndustrial Designer:Wind up\nProject Manager:sorry . We have to to go through the meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:? Okay , some other time .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:Thank you {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:We can discuss that off-line .\nProject Manager:Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do {disfmarker} we'll do another meeting abo on elephants .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about {disfmarker} so about finances . So {vocalsound} we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} which which would generate a profit of of um {vocalsound} fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market .\nUser Interface:So could I just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ?\nProject Manager:O this is the {vocalsound} next topic we have to discuss exactly ,\nUser Interface:Okay , alright .\nProject Manager:so let's go to it . So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? Should it be a universal one ? And uh etcetera . So um {vocalsound} so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go .\nUser Interface:Okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to {disfmarker} a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , but I guess if that's {disfmarker} if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually {disfmarker} you know , what people ar are willing to pay for {disfmarker} um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:because it seems quite a lot for a remote control ,\nProject Manager:Okay I think this is more a job to our\nUser Interface:so it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:market person yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Marketing person .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So we need to close the meeting . Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so {gap} the work every every of you ha have t d to do . So um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . Thanks for coming today .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Thanks .\nIndustrial Designer:Thanks .\nUser Interface:Alright .\n",

OK Well , so Ralf and Tilman are here .\nProfessor F:OK . Great . Great .\nGrad B:Made it safely .\nProfessor F:So the {disfmarker} what w we h have been doing i they would like us all to read these digits . But we don't all read them but a couple people read them .\nPhD A:OK .\nProfessor F:Uh , wanna give them all with German accents today or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad B:Sure .\nProfessor F:OK .\nGrad B:OK and the way you do it is you just read the numbers not as uh each single , so just like I do it .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:OK . First you read the transcript number . Turn .\nGrad D:OK , uh {disfmarker} What 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:OK . Let 's be done with this .\nPhD A:OK .\nProfessor F:OK . this is Ami , who {disfmarker} And this is Tilman and Ralf .\nPhD A:Hi . Uh - huh . Nice to meet you .\nGrad D:Hi .\nProfessor F:Hi . OK . So we 're gonna try to finish by five so people who want to can go hear Nancy Chang 's talk , uh downstairs .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nProfessor F:And you guys are g giving talks on tomorrow and Wednesday lunch times ,\nPhD A:Yes .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:right ? That 's great . OK so , do y do you know what we 're gonna do ?\nGrad B:I thought two things uh we 'll introduce ourselves and what we do . And um we already talked with Andreas , Thilo and David and some lines of code were already written today and almost tested and just gonna say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on and that should be no problem and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get {disfmarker} enter the tourism domain . em we have talked this morning with the {disfmarker} with Tilman about the generator .\nPhD A:S\nGrad B:and um There one of our diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to look over Tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to English\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:because w we have {disfmarker} we face two ways . Either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way , or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the German system and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse uh not parse not the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure which is the way we decided we were gonna go because A , it 's easier in the beginning\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:and um it does require some {disfmarker} some knowledge of {disfmarker} of those grammars and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and some ling linguistic background . But um it shouldn't be a problem for anyone .\nProfessor F:OK So That sounds good . Johno , are you gonna have some time t to do that uh w with these guys ?\nGrad E:Sure .\nProfessor F:cuz y you 're the grammar maven .\nGrad E:OK .\nProfessor F:I mean it makes sense ,\nGrad E:Yeah .\nProfessor F:doesn't it ? Yeah Good . OK . So , I think that 's probably the {disfmarker} the right way to do that . And an Yeah , so I {disfmarker} I actually wanna f to find out about it too , but I may not have time to get in .\nGrad B:the {disfmarker} the ultimate goal is that before they leave we {disfmarker} we can run through the entire system input through output on at least one or two sample things . And um and by virtue of doing that then in this case Johno will have acquired the knowledge of how to extend it . Ad infinitum . When needed , if needed , when wanted and so forth .\nProfessor F:OK that sounds great .\nGrad B:And um also um Ralf has hooked up with David and you 're gonna continue either all through tonight or tomorrow on whatever to get the er parser interface working .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nGrad B:They are thinning out and thickening out lattices and doing this kind of stuff to see what works best .\nGrad D:Mmm , yep .\nProfessor F:Great . So , you guys enjoy your weekend ?\nPhD A:Yes , very much so .\nGrad D:Yeah , very much\nProfessor F:OK , before {disfmarker} before you got put to work ?\nGrad D:Yeah\nProfessor F:Great . OK , so that 's {disfmarker} Sort of one branch is to get us caught up on what 's going on . Also of course it would be really nice to know what the plans are , in addition to what 's sort of already in code .\nPhD A:Yes .\nProfessor F:and we can d I dunno w w was there uh a time when we were set up to do that ? It probably will work better if we do it later in the week , after {pause} we actually understand uh better what 's going on .\nPhD A:Yes .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor F:So when do you guys leave ?\nPhD A:Um we 're here through Sunday ,\nGrad D:Oh\nPhD A:so All through Friday would be fine .\nProfessor F:Oh , OK , so {disfmarker} OK , So {disfmarker} so anyt we 'll find a time later in the week to uh get together and talk about {pause} your understanding of what SmartKom plans are .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:and how we can change them .\nPhD A:Yes . Sure .\nProfessor F:Uh ,\nGrad B:Should we already set a date for that ? Might be beneficial while we 're all here .\nProfessor F:OK ? um What {disfmarker} what does not work for me is Thursday afternoon . I can do earlier in the day on Thursday , or {pause} um {pause} most of the time on Friday , not all .\nGrad B:Thursday morning sounds fine ?\nProfessor F:Wha - but , Johno ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:what are your constraints ?\nGrad E:um Thursday afternoon doesn't work for me , but {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Neither does Thursday morning , no ?\nGrad E:Uh Thursday morning should be fine .\nPhD A:OK .\nProfessor F:Eleven ? Eleven on Thursday ?\nGrad E:I was just thinking I w I will {pause} have {pause} leavened by eleven .\nProfessor F:Right . Right . This is then out of deference to our non - morning people .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . OK . So at eleven ?\nGrad D:Hmm .\nPhD A:Thursday around eleven ? OK .\nProfessor F:Yeah . And actually we can invite um Andreas as well .\nGrad B:Uh he will be in Washington , though .\nProfessor F:Oh that 's true . He 's off {disfmarker} off on his trip already .\nGrad B:but um David is here and he 's actually knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer .\nProfessor F:Thilo . OK well yeah maybe we 'll see if David could make it . That would be good .\nGrad B:OK so facing to {disfmarker} to what we 've sort of been doing here um well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data .\nPhD A:Yeah obviously .\nGrad B:um um Not this type of data ,\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nGrad B:no not meeting data but sort of {disfmarker} sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such not like the ones in Munich but pretty close to it .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:The major difference to the Munich ones is that we do it via the telephone\nPhD A:OK .\nGrad B:even though all the recording is done here and so it 's a {disfmarker} sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:tells you how to get places . And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on . and part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nGrad B:and we 're setting it up so that we can {disfmarker} we hope to implant certain intentions in people . For example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that \" How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? \" OK so you have the {disfmarker} castle of Heidelberg\nPhD A:OK .\nGrad B:and there is a tower and it 's called Powder - Tower .\nPhD A:Oh , OK . Yeah .\nGrad B:and um so What will you parse out of that sentence ? Probably something that we specified in M - three - L , that is @ @ {comment} \" action go to whatever domain , object whatever Powder - Tower \" .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nGrad B:And maybe some model will tell us , some GPS module , in the mobile scenario where the person is at the moment . And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project and we noticed that first of all what are {disfmarker} I should 've brought some slides , but what our {disfmarker} So here 's the tower . Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower . And our system led people here , to a point where they were facing a wall in front of the tower . There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center Because that 's how the algorithm works . So we took out that part of the road network as a hack and then it found actually the way to the entrance . which was now the closest point of the road network to\nPhD A:Yeah .\nGrad B:OK , geometric center . But what we actually observed in Heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually don't want to enter , because it 's not really interesting . They wanna go to a completely different point where they can look at it and take a picture .\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nGrad B:And so what uh uh a s you s let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants . Does he wanna go there to see it ? Does he wanna go there now ? Later ? How does the person wanna go there ? Is that person more likely to want to walk there ? Walk a scenic route ? and so forth . There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . And we are constructing {disfmarker} and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . Information related to the user and information related to the situation . And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that what we can get from the utterance . That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it . And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention {pause} was . And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . So if it can make a good suggestion , \" Hey ! \" you know , \" that person doesn't wanna enter . That person just wants to take a picture , \" cuz he just bought film , or \" that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before \" . Or \" that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something and that you usually do inside of buildings \" and so forth . These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an {disfmarker} sort of subfield that we have reserved . And if the action planner does something with it , great . If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really {disfmarker} at least we {comment} want to offer the extra information . We don't really {disfmarker} um we 're not too worried .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nGrad B:I mean {disfmarker} t s Ultimately if you have {disfmarker} if you can offer that information , somebody 's gonna s do something with it sooner or later . That 's sort of part of our belief .\nGrad E:What was he saying ?\nGrad B:Um , for example , right now I know the GIS from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints . So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it . Surely nobody 's gonna go ahead and implement it if it 's never gonna be used , so . What have I forgotten about ? Oh yeah , how we do it ,\nProfessor F:Well th uh\nGrad B:yeah that 's the\nProfessor F:No no . It 's a good time to pause . I s I see {pause} questions on peoples ' faces , so why don't {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Oh\nProfessor F:let 's {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker} Let 's hear {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Well the obvious one would be if {disfmarker} if you envision this as a module within SmartKom , where exactly would that Sit ? That 's the d\nGrad B:um {disfmarker} so far I 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module .\nPhD A:OK , yeah .\nGrad B:So this is one that already adds additional information to the\nGrad D:Hmm .\nPhD A:Makes perfect sense . Yes .\nGrad D:Hmm , ah .\nGrad B:but it could sit anywhere in the attention - recognition I mean basically this is what attention - recognition literally sort of can {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Well it 's supposed to do . Yeah\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:That 's what it should do .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor F:Right ,\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor F:yeah .\nGrad D:Huh .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nPhD A:Well f from my understanding of what the people at Phillips were originally trying to do doesn't seem to quite fit into SmartKom currently so what they 're really doing right now is only selecting among the alternatives , the hypotheses that they 're given enriched by the domain knowledge and the um discourse modeler and so on .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nPhD A:So if {disfmarker} if this is additional information that could be merged in by them .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nPhD A:And then it would be available to action planning and {disfmarker} and others .\nGrad B:Yeah . the {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:let 's {disfmarker} let 's That w OK that was one question . Is there other {disfmarker} other things that cuz {pause} we wanna not Pa - pass over any {pause} you know , questions or concerns that you have .\nPhD A:Well there 're {disfmarker} there 're two levels of {disfmarker} of giving an answer and I guess on both levels I don't have any um further questions .\nGrad D:Mmm . Mmm .\nPhD A:uh the {disfmarker} the two levels will be as far as I 'm concerned as {pause} uh standing here for the generation module\nGrad D:Mmm .\nPhD A:and the other is {disfmarker} is my understanding of what SmartKom uh is supposed to be\nProfessor F:Right .\nPhD A:and I {disfmarker} I think that fits in perfectly\nProfessor F:So {disfmarker} well , let me {disfmarker} Let me s {pause} expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor F:So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig um Robert didn't bring it today but there 's a {disfmarker} a belief - net which is {disfmarker} There 's a first cut at a belief - net that {disfmarker} that doesn't {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} isn't fully uh instantiated , and in particular some of the {disfmarker} the combination rules and ways of getting the {disfmarker} the conditional probabilities aren't there . But we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:and the things that influence them . So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing . Do you want to um access , view or enter a thing .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nProfessor F:So that 's a a discrete decision .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:There are only three possibilities and the uh {disfmarker} what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:But , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:Alright ? Now there are two ways one can go {disfmarker} a imagine doing that . For the debugging we 'll probably just have a {disfmarker} a drop - down menu and the {disfmarker} while you 're debugging you will just {disfmarker} OK . But for a full system , then one might very well formulate a query ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:give it to the dialogue planner and say this , you know ar are you know you {disfmarker} are you planning to enter ? Or whatever it {disfmarker} whatever that might be . So that 's {disfmarker} under that model then , There would be a {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query ,\nPhD A:Yes .\nProfessor F:presumably give it to you . That would get expressed and then hopefully you know , you 'd get an answer {pause} back .\nPhD A:Yep .\nProfessor F:And that would of course {disfmarker} the answer would have to be parsed .\nGrad D:Mmm . Yep .\nProfessor F:right and {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Yes .\nProfessor F:OK so , {pause} th {pause} that uh , We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .\nPhD A:Yep .\nProfessor F:But While we 're on the subject I just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said \" OK we 're now ready to try to close that loop \" in terms of querying about some of these decisions .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nPhD A:Yep . So {disfmarker} my suggestion then is that you um look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the action plans are supposed to look like . And they 're currently um Agreeing or {disfmarker} or in the process of agreeing on an X M L - ification of um something like a state - transition network of how dialogues would proceed . and {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} these um transition networks uh will be what the action planner interprets in a sense .\nProfessor F:Hmm . D did you know this Robert ?\nGrad B:uh Michael is doing that , right ?\nPhD A:Well uh Marcus Lerkult is actually implementing that stuff and Marcus and Michael together are um leading the discussion there , yeah .\nGrad B:OK .\nProfessor F:So we ha we have to get in on that .\nPhD A:Yep .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:because um partly those are like X - schemas .\nPhD A:Definitely .\nProfessor F:the transition diagrams .\nGrad B:Hmm .\nProfessor F:And it may be that {disfmarker} that um we should early on make sure that they have the flexibility that we need .\nGrad B:Hmm . But they uh Have I understood this right ? They {disfmarker} they govern more or less the {disfmarker} the dialogue behavior or the action {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:It 's not really what you do with the content of the dialogue but it 's So , I mean there is this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this nice interf\nGrad D:uh , No , it 's {disfmarker} it 's also a quantrant uh uh {disfmarker}\nGrad B:i Is it {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:So there 's ac so there {disfmarker} th the word \" action \" , OK , is {disfmarker} is what 's ambiguous here .\nGrad D:I think . Hmm .\nPhD A:Yes .\nProfessor F:So , um one thing is there 's an actual planner that tells the person in the tourist domain now ,\nPhD A:OK .\nProfessor F:per tells the person how to go , \" First go here ,\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:first go there uh , you know , take a bus \" , whatever it is . So that 's that form of planning , and action , and a route planner and GIS , all sort of stuff . uh But I think that isn't what you mean .\nPhD A:No . No , in SmartKom terminology that 's um called a function that 's modeled by a function modeler . And it 's th that 's completely um encapsulated from th the dialogue system . That 's simply a functionality that you give data as in a query and then you get back from that mmm , a functioning model um which might be a planner or a VCR or whatever . um some result and that 's then {disfmarker} then used .\nProfessor F:Well , OK , so that 's what I thought . So action he action here means dia uh speech ac uh you know dialogue act .\nPhD A:Yeah , yeah . Yeah , in that {disfmarker} in that sense\nGrad B:Mmm .\nPhD A:yes , dialogue act ,\nProfessor F:Yeah .\nPhD A:yeah .\nProfessor F:Um , I think tha I think it 's not going to {disfmarker} I think that 's not going to be good enough . I I don what uh {disfmarker} what I meant by that . So I think the idea of having a , you know , transition diagram for the grammar of conversations is a good idea .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:OK ? And I think that we do hav definitely have to get in on it and find out {disfmarker} OK . But I think that um when {disfmarker} so , when you get to the tourist domain it 's not just an information retrieval system .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . Clearly . Yes .\nProfessor F:Right ? So this i this is where I think this {disfmarker} people are gonna have to think this through a bit more carefully .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:So , if it 's only like in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the film and T V thing , OK , you can do this . And you just get information and give it to people . But what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on\nPhD A:Yep .\nProfessor F:Uh , y y your {disfmarker} I d I think the notion of this as a self contained uh module you know th the functional module that {disfmarker} that interacts with {disfmarker} with where the tourism g stuff is going {comment} probably is too restrictive .\nPhD A:Yep .\nProfessor F:Now I dunno how much people have thought ahead to the tourist domain in this\nPhD A:Probably not enough , I mean an {disfmarker} another uh more basic point there is that the current um tasks and therefore th the concepts in this ac what 's called the action plan and what 's really the dialogue manager .\nProfessor F:Yeah\nPhD A:um is based on slots that have to be filled and the um kind of values in these slots would be fixed things like the a time or a movie title or something like this\nProfessor F:Mm - hmm . Right .\nPhD A:whereas in the a um tourist domain it might be an entire route . Set - based , or even very complex structured information in these slots\nProfessor F:Indeed . Right .\nPhD A:and I 'm not sure if {disfmarker} if complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration .\nProfessor F:OK .\nPhD A:So that 's {disfmarker} that 's really something we\nProfessor F:Could you {disfmarker} could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ?\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:Yep .\nPhD A:I mean nothing 's being completely settled there\nGrad B:rea yep\nPhD A:so this is really an ongoing discussion\nGrad B:Mm - hmm\nPhD A:and that 's\nGrad B:yeah and um it might actually OK ah also {disfmarker} because um again in in Deep Map we have faced and implemented those problems once already\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:maybe we can even shuffle some know how from there to to Markus and Michael .\nPhD A:Yes .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nPhD A:Yep .\nGrad B:And um mmm You don't know {disfmarker} OK th I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to Michael it 's what I do anyway . Who {disfmarker} How far is the uh the {disfmarker} the M - three - L specification for {disfmarker} for the la natural language input gone on the {disfmarker} the uh I haven't seen anything for the uh tourist path domain .\nGrad D:Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not defined yet .\nGrad B:And um you are probably also involved in that ,\nGrad D:Um {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad B:right ? uh together with the usual gang , um Petra and Jan\nGrad D:Mmm . Yeah , there 's a meeting next next week I think\nGrad B:OK because That 's {disfmarker} Those are the {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} the true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like and then what the action planner does with it {disfmarker} and how that is uh specified . I didn't think of the internal working of the uh the action planner and the language {disfmarker} uh the function model as sort of relevant . Because what {disfmarker} what they take is sort of this {disfmarker} this fixed representation of a {disfmarker} of an intention .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:And that can be as detailed or as crude as you want it to be . But um the internal workings of of the {disfmarker} whether you know there 're dialogue {disfmarker} action planners that work with belief - nets that are action planners that work with you know state automata . So that shouldn't really matter too much . I mean it does matter because it does have to keep track of you {disfmarker} we are on part six of r a route that consists of eight steps and so forth\nPhD A:Right .\nProfessor F:Yeah , th there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are a lot of reasons why it matters . OK , so that uh , for example , the i it 's the action planner is going to take some spec and s make some suggestions about what the user should do . What the user says after that is going to be very much caught up with what the action planner told it .\nPhD A:Yes .\nProfessor F:If the {disfmarker} If the parser and the language end doesn't know what the person 's been told OK th it 's you 're making your life much more difficult than it has to be .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nProfessor F:Right ? So if someone says the best t to uh go there is by taxi , let 's say . Now the planner comes out and says you wanna get there fast , take a taxi . OK . And the language end doesn't know that . OK , there 's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be just fine .\nPhD A:hmm\nGrad B:Yeah .\nProfessor F:uh\nPhD A:That would b but that {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that uh point has been realized and it 's {disfmarker} it 's not really um been defined yet but there 's gonna be some kind of feedback and input from uh the action planner into all the analysis modules , telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nPhD A:Beyond what 's currently being implemented which is just word lists .\nProfessor F:Yeah , but this is not the st this is not just the state of the discourse .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:Of {disfmarker} of special interest .\nProfessor F:This is actually the state of the plan . That 's why\nPhD A:Yes , Yes , Mm - hmm yeah .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:OK so it {disfmarker} z and s uh , It 's great if people are already taking that into account . But One would have t have to see {disfmarker} see the details .\nPhD A:The specifics aren't really there yet . Yes . So , there 's work to do there .\nProfessor F:Yeah . So anyway , Robert , that 's why I was thinking that\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:um I think you 're gonna need {disfmarker} We talked about this several times that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end .\nPhD A:hmm\nProfessor F:In {disfmarker} in one of these things which are {disfmarker} are much more continuous than the {disfmarker} just the dialogue over movies and stuff .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nPhD A:And even on {disfmarker} on a more basic level the {disfmarker} the action planner actually needs to be able to have um an expressive power that can deal with these structures . And not just um say um {disfmarker} um the dialogue um will consist of ten possible states and th these states really are fixed in {disfmarker} in a certain sense .\nProfessor F:Hmm ?\nPhD A:You have to {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Would there be any chance of getting the terminology changed so that the dialogue planner was called a \" dialogue planner \" ? Because there 's this other thing The o There 's this other thing in {disfmarker} in the tourist domain which is gonna be a route planner\nPhD A:That 'd be nice .\nProfessor F:or {disfmarker} It 's really gonna be an action planner . And {comment} i it {disfmarker}\nPhD A:It oughta be called a {disfmarker} a dialogue manager . cuz that 's what everybody else calls it .\nProfessor F:I would think ,\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:yeah .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor F:Huh ? So , s So what would happen if we sent a note saying \" Gee we 've talked about this and couldn't we change this uh th the whole word ? \" I have no idea how complicated these things are .\nGrad B:Probably close to impossible .\nPhD A:Depends on who you talk to how . We 'll see . I 'll go check , cause I completely agree . Yeah ,\nGrad D:Mmm .\nPhD A:and I think this is just for historical reasons within uh , the preparation phase of the project and not because somebody actually believes it ought to be action planner . So if there is resistance against changing it , that 's just because \" Oh , We don't want to change things . \" That {disfmarker} that not deep reason\nProfessor F:OK , anyway . I if {disfmarker} if that c in persists then we 're gonna need another term . for the thing that actually does the planning of the uh routes and whatever we are doing for the tourist .\nGrad B:That 's external services .\nProfessor F:Yeah , but that 's not g eh tha That ha has all the wrong connotations . it 's {disfmarker} it sounds like it 's you know stand alone . It doesn't interact , it doesn't That 's why I 'm saying . I think you can't {disfmarker} it 's fine for looking up when T you know when the show 's on TV . You go to th but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it 's really {disfmarker} really wrong headed for something that you {disfmarker} that has a lot of state , it 's gonna interact co in a complicated way with the uh understanding parts .\nGrad B:Yeah . Yeah I think just the {disfmarker} the spatial planner and the route planner I showed you once the interac action between them among them in the deep map system\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad B:so {disfmarker} a printout of the communication between those two fills up I don't know how many pages\nPhD A:Hmm\nGrad B:and that 's just part of how do I get to one place . It 's really insane . and uh but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh Michael into the discussion . Or to enter his discussion , actually .\nPhD A:Yeah , Marcus .\nGrad B:That 's the way around . Markus\nPhD A:Wh - where 's ?\nGrad B:Is he new in the {disfmarker} in the ?\nPhD A:Yeah , he 's {disfmarker} he started um I think January .\nGrad D:Yeah .\nPhD A:And he 's gonna be responsible for the implementation of this action planner . Dialogue manager .\nGrad B:Is he gonna continue with the old {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} thing ?\nPhD A:No , no he 's completely gonna rewrite everything . In Java .\nGrad B:OK .\nPhD A:OK so that 's interesting .\nGrad B:Yes I was just {disfmarker} that 's my next question\nPhD A:hmm\nGrad B:whether we 're {disfmarker} we 're gonna stick to Prolog or not .\nPhD A:No . No , that 's gonna be phased out .\nProfessor F:Yeah .\nGrad B:OK But I do think the {disfmarker} the function modeling concept has a certain {disfmarker} makes sense in a {disfmarker} in a certain light\nPhD A:Yeah .\nGrad B:because the action planner should not be {disfmarker} or the dialogue manager in that case should not um w have to worry about whether it 's interfacing with um something that does route planning in this way or that way\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:I I totally agree .\nGrad B:huh ,\nProfessor F:Sure .\nGrad B:it j\nProfessor F:Yeah I {disfmarker} I agree . There is {disfmarker} there 's a logic to dialogue which {disfmarker} which is {disfmarker} is separable . I Yeah .\nGrad B:and it {disfmarker} cant {disfmarker} sort of formulate its what it wants in a {disfmarker} in a rather a abstract uh way , you know f \" Find me a good route for this . \"\nProfessor F:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:It doesn't really have to worry ab how route planner A or how route planner B actually wants it . So this is {disfmarker} seemed like a good idea . In the beginning .\nProfessor F:It 's tricky . It 's tricky because one could well imagine {disfmarker} I think it will turn out to be the case that uh , this thing we 're talking about , th the extended n uh knowledge modeler will fill in some parameters about what the person wants . One could well imagine that the next thing that 's trying to fill out the detailed uh , route planning , let 's say , will also have questions that it would like to ask the user . You could well imagine you get to a point where it 's got a {disfmarker} a choice to make and it just doesn't know something .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:And so y you would like it t also be able to uh formulate a query . And to run that back through uh . the dialogue manager and to the output module and back around .\nGrad B:hmm\nProfessor F:And a I a a good design would {disfmarker} would allow that to happen .\nGrad B:a lot of , yeah\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:If {disfmarker} if you know if {disfmarker} if you can't make it happen then you {disfmarker} you do your best .\nPhD A:Yeah but that doesn't necessarily contradict um an architecture where there really is a pers a def well - defined interface . and {disfmarker} and\nProfessor F:I totally agree . But {disfmarker} but what it nee but th what the point is the in that case the dialogue manager is sort of event driven . So the dialogue manager may think it 's in a dialogue state of one sort ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:and this {disfmarker} one of these planning modules comes along and says \" hey , right now we need to ask a question \" . So that forces the dialogue manager to change state .\nPhD A:Yes\nProfessor F:OK .\nPhD A:Sure ,\nProfessor F:It could be y\nPhD A:ye yeah I {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's the um concept that people have ,\nProfessor F:Yeah , yeah it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}\nPhD A:yep .\nProfessor F:OK .\nPhD A:And {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} the underlying idea of course is that there is something like kernel modules with kernel functionality that you can plug uh certain applications like tourist information or um the home scenario with uh controlling a VCR and so on . And then extend it to an arbitrary number of applications eventually . So {disfmarker} wouldn't That 's an additional reason to have this well - defined interface and keep these things like uh tourist information external .\nProfessor F:Oh , yeah , yeah .\nPhD A:And then call it external services .\nGrad B:Hmm .\nPhD A:But of course the {disfmarker} the more complex {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Yeah , there is another philosophical issue that I think you know you can {disfmarker} evade\nPhD A:yep .\nGrad B:but , at at least it makes sense to me that sooner or later uh {disfmarker} a service is gonna come and describe itself to you . and that 's sort of what Srini is working on in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the DAML uh project where um you {disfmarker} you find a GIS about {disfmarker} that gives you information on Berkeley ,\nPhD A:Yeah .\nGrad B:and it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be there and tell you what it can do and how it wants to do things . and so you can actually interface to such a system without ever having met it before and the function modeler and a self - description of the um external service haggle it out\nPhD A:Hmm .\nGrad B:and you can use the same language core , understanding core to interface with planner - A , planner - B , planner - C and so forth .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nGrad B:Which is , you know , uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} utopian {disfmarker} completely utopian at the moment , but slowly , you know , getting into the realm of the uh contingent .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nGrad B:But we are facing of course much more um realistic problems . And language input for example , is of course uh crucial you know also when you do the sort of deep understanding analysis that we envision . um Then of course , the uh um , you know what is it {disfmarker} poverty of the stimulus , yet the m uh the less we get of that the better . and um so we {disfmarker} we 're thinking , for example how much syntactic analysis actually happens already in the parser . and whether one could interface to that potentially\nGrad D:Hmm . Yeah , are there currently is uh no syntactic analysis but in the next release there will be some .\nGrad B:Hmm .\nGrad D:unless\nProfessor F:How 's it {disfmarker}\nGrad D:and it 's um uh you can access this\nProfessor F:S so uh y we {disfmarker} we looked at the e current pattern matching thing .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nProfessor F:And as you say it 's just a surface pattern matcher . Uh , So what are {disfmarker} what are the plans roughly ?\nGrad D:um it 's to {disfmarker} to integrate and syntactic analysis . and um add some more features like segmentation . So then an utter more than one utterance is {disfmarker} There um there 's often uh pause between it and a segmentation occurs . um\nProfessor F:So , the um {disfmarker} So the idea is to uh {disfmarker} have a pa y y a particular {disfmarker}\nGrad D:yeah\nProfessor F:Do you have a particular parser in mind ? Is it uh {disfmarker} partic d I mean have you thought through {disfmarker} ? Is it an HPSG parser ? Is it a whatever ?\nGrad D:No {disfmarker} no it 's {disfmarker} uh I think it 's it 's totally complicated for it 's just one {disfmarker} one person\nProfessor F:OK .\nGrad D:and so I have to keep the {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Oh , you have to do it . You have to do it ,\nGrad D:Yeah ,\nProfessor F:yeah .\nGrad D:ah and so {vocalsound} things must be simpler\nProfessor F:I see ,\nGrad D:but uh , Miel syntactic analysis with um finite state transducers .\nProfessor F:so But the people at D F Yeah . People at DFKI have written a fair number of parsers . Other {disfmarker} you know , people over the years . uh have written various parsers at DFKI . None of them are suitable ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I 'm asking . I don't know .\nGrad D:Yeah , uh the problem is th that it has to be very fast because um if you want to for more than one path anywhere\nProfessor F:OK .\nGrad D:what 's in the latches from the speech recognizer\nProfessor F:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:so it 's speed is crucial . uh And they are not fast enough .\nProfessor F:Mm - hmm .\nGrad D:And they also have to be very robust . cuz of um speech recognition errors and\nProfessor F:OK . So , um {disfmarker} So there was a chunk parser in Verbmobil , that was one of the uh branchers . You know they {disfmarker} d th I c There were these various uh , competing uh syntax modules . And I know one of them was a chunk parser and I don't remember {pause} who did that .\nGrad B:A Alan ?\nGrad D:I think it 's that might , at Tuebingen I thought .\nProfessor F:Yeah I d I don't remember .\nGrad D:was {disfmarker} Do you know something about that ?\nPhD A:Tubingen was at least involved in putting the chunks together\nGrad D:In Tub - at {disfmarker}\nPhD A:I {disfmarker} can't quite recall whether they actually produced the chunks in the first place .\nGrad D:oh\nProfessor F:Uh . I see . Yeah , that 's right .\nPhD A:Or wh\nGrad D:Oh from {disfmarker} from Stuttgart ,\nProfessor F:There w That 's right . They w They had {disfmarker} There were {disfmarker} This was done with a two phase thing , where {comment} the chunk parser itself was pretty stupid\nGrad D:yeah , also\nProfessor F:and then there was a kind of trying to fit them together that h used more context .\nPhD A:Right . Yeah\nProfessor F:Right ?\nPhD A:Well you s and {disfmarker} and especially you did some {disfmarker} some um , l um was a learning - based approach which learned from a big corpus of {disfmarker} of trees .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:Right .\nPhD A:And yes the {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} the chunk parser was a finite - state machine that um Mark Light originally w worked on in {disfmarker} while he was in Tuebingen\nProfessor F:Right .\nPhD A:and then somebody else in Tuebingen picked that up . So it was done in Tuebingen , yeah . Definitely .\nProfessor F:But is that the kind of thing y It sounds like the kind of thing that you were thinking of .\nPhD A:Yeah I guess it 's similar .\nGrad D:yeah . yeah that 's In this direction , yes\nProfessor F:What ?\nGrad D:Yeah , it 's in {disfmarker} in this direction .\nGrad B:The {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Hmm .\nGrad B:From Michael Strube , I 've heard very good stuff about the chunk parser that is done by FORWISS , uh , which is in embassy doing the parsing .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:So this is sort of {disfmarker} came as a surprise to me that you know , embassy s {comment} is featuring a nice parser but it 's {pause} what I hear . One could also look at that and see whether there is some synergy possible .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm , yeah , it would be very interesting , Mm - hmm . Mmm , yeah .\nGrad B:And they 're doing chunk parsing and it 's uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can give you the names of the people who do it there . But um . Then there is of course more ways of parsing things .\nProfessor F:Of course . But {disfmarker} But uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing . And uh I 'm not a big believer in this um statistical you know , cleaning up uh It {disfmarker} That seems to me kind of a last resort if uh you can't do it any other way . uh but I dunno .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nProfessor F:It may {disfmarker} i i may be that 's what you guys finally decide do . Uh . And have you looked {disfmarker} uh just {disfmarker} again for context {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:There is this {disfmarker} this one that they did at SRI some years ago {disfmarker} Fastus ?\nGrad D:um\nProfessor F:a {disfmarker}\nGrad D:yeah , I 've {disfmarker} I 've looked at it but {disfmarker} but it 's no {disfmarker} not much uh information available . I found ,\nProfessor F:ah !\nGrad D:but it 's also finite - state transducers , I thought .\nProfessor F:It is . Yeah . I mean {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it was pretty ambitious .\nGrad D:and\nProfessor F:And of course it was English oriented ,\nGrad D:Yeah , and {disfmarker} and Purely finite - state transducers are not so good for German since there 's um\nProfessor F:um w Right .\nGrad D:The word order is {disfmarker} is uh not fixed\nProfessor F:Yeah , I guess that 's the point is {disfmarker} is all the morphology and stuff . And English is all th all word order . And it makes a lot more sense .\nGrad D:Yeah .\nProfessor F:And {disfmarker} e Yeah , OK . Good point . So in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in German you 've got uh most of this done with\nGrad D:Mm - hmm . Also it 's uh {disfmarker} it 's um {disfmarker} Yes , uh the um choice between uh this processing and that processing and my template matcher .\nProfessor F:Right . Right .\nGrad D:\nProfessor F:So what about Um Did y like Morfix ? a a e y you 've got stemmers ? Or is that something that {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Um , yeah but it 's all in the {disfmarker} in the lexicon . So it 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:But did you have that ?\nGrad D:Yeah th the information is available .\nProfessor F:OK . I see . So , but {disfmarker}\nGrad D:So {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:So y you just connect to the lexicon\nGrad D:Yeah\nProfessor F:and uh at least for German you have all {disfmarker} all of the {disfmarker} uh the stemming information .\nGrad D:Yeah , we can , oh yeah . We have knowledge bases from {disfmarker} from Verbmobil system we can use\nProfessor F:Yep .\nGrad D:and so .\nProfessor F:Right . But it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it doesn't look like i you 're using it . I didn't n see it being used in the current template uh parser . I {disfmarker} I didn't see any Uh {disfmarker} of course we l actually only looked at the English .\nGrad D:It {disfmarker} um\nProfessor F:Did we look at the German ? I don't remember .\nGrad D:Yeah , but {disfmarker} but it 's used for {disfmarker} for stem forms .\nProfessor F:So w wha\nPhD A:n Well I think {disfmarker} I think there 's some misunderstanding here\nProfessor F:i\nPhD A:it 's {disfmarker} Morphix is not used on - line .\nGrad D:Oh , OK .\nPhD A:s so the lexicon might be derived by Morphix\nGrad D:What ?\nPhD A:but What {disfmarker} what 's happening on - line is just um um a {disfmarker} a retrieval from the lexicon which would give all the stemming information\nProfessor F:Right .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nProfessor F:Right .\nPhD A:so it would be a full foreign lexicon .\nProfessor F:And that 's what you have .\nPhD A:Yep .\nGrad D:Yeah\nProfessor F:OK .\nGrad B:We threw out all the forms .\nProfessor F:What {disfmarker} uh I didn't reme\nGrad B:We threw out all the forms\nProfessor F:Huh ?\nGrad B:because , you know , English , well {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Oh OK , so it {disfmarker} yeah , s s I thought I 'd {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:So in German then you actually do case matching and things like in the {disfmarker} in the pattern matcher or not ?\nGrad D:um Not yet but it 's planned to do that .\nProfessor F:OK . Cuz I r I didn't reme I didn't think I saw it .\nGrad D:Yeah\nProfessor F:Have we looked at the German ? Oh , I haven yeah that 's {disfmarker} getting it from the lexicon is just fine .\nPhD A:Sure , right .\nGrad D:Oh yes .\nProfessor F:Yeah , yeah , yeah . No problem with that . um Yeah and here 's the case where the English and the German might really be significantly different . In terms of if you 're trying to build some fast parser and so forth and {disfmarker} You really might wanna do it in a significantly different way . I don't know . So you 've {disfmarker} you guys have looked at this ? also ? in terms of You know , w if you 're doing this for English as well as German Um Do you think now that it would be this {disfmarker} doing it similarly ?\nGrad D:um Yeah , it 's um I think it 's um yes , it 's {disfmarker} it 's um possible to {disfmarker} to do list processing . and Maybe this is um more adequate for English and in German um set processing is used .\nProfessor F:Set .\nGrad D:Maybe yeah . Some extensions uh have to be made . For {disfmarker} for a English version\nProfessor F:Mmm . OK . Interesting . Not easy .\nGrad B:Well there 's m I 'm sure there 's gonna be more discussion on that after your talk .\nGrad D:Mm - hmm ,\nGrad B:We 're just gonna foreshadow what we saw that\nGrad D:yeah .\nProfessor F:Right . Right .\nGrad B:and um\nProfessor F:Now actually , um Are you guys free at five ? Or {disfmarker} Do you have to go somewhere at five o ' clock tonight ? W in ten minutes ?\nGrad D:Ah {disfmarker}\nPhD A:uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I think we 're expect {disfmarker}\nGrad D:mmm . No . Oder there was an {disfmarker} talk ?\nPhD A:Yeah , there {disfmarker} there 's the um practice talk .\nGrad D:uh Mmm , yeah .\nProfessor F:Great . So you 're going to that .\nPhD A:Yeah , that {disfmarker} that 's what we were planning to do .\nProfessor F:That 's good , because that will uh tell you a fair amount about The form of semantic construction grammar that we 're using .\nPhD A:Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:so {disfmarker} So I th I think that probably as good an introduction as you 'll get .\nGrad D:Ah .\nProfessor F:Uh to the form of {disfmarker} of uh {disfmarker} conceptual grammar that {disfmarker} that w we have in mind for this .\nGrad D:Mmm , ah .\nProfessor F:It won't talk particularly about how that relates to what uh Robert was saying at the beginning . But let me give you a very short version of this . So we talked about the fact that There 're going to be a certain number of decisions That you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning . It 's called the \" route planner \" or something .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:So there are these decisions . And then one half of this we talked about at little bit is how if you had the right information , if you knew something about what was said and about th the something about was the agent a tourist or a native or a business person or uh young or old , whatever . That information , and also about the Uh , what we 're calling \" the entity \" , Is it a castle , is it a bank ? Is it a s town square , is it a statue ? Whatever . So all that kind of information could be combined into decision networks and give you decisions . But the other half of the problem is How would you get that kind of information from the parsed input ? So , um So what you might try to do is just build more templates , saying uh we 're trying to build a templ you know build a template that w uh somehow would capture the fact that he wants to take a picture .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:OK ? And {disfmarker} and we could {disfmarker} you could do this . And it 's a small enough domain that probably you , you know {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:OK . You could do this . But uh from our point of view this is also a research project and there are a couple of people not here for various reasons who are doing doctoral dissertations on this ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:and the idea that we 're really after is a very deep semantics based on cognitive linguistics and the notion that there are a relatively small number of primitive conceptual schemas that characterize a lot of activity . So a typical one in this formulation is a container . So this is a static thing . And the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers . Going in and out the portals and con\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:OK . But also , importantly for Lakoff and these guys is all sorts of metaphorical things are also characterized this way . You get in trouble and you know et cetera\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor F:and so {disfmarker} s So , what we 're really trying to do is to map from the discourse to the conceptual semantics level . And from there to the appropriate decisions .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:So another one of these primitive , what are called \" image schemas \" , is uh goal seeking . So this a notion of a source , path , goal , trajector , possibly obstacles .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:And the idea is this is another conceptual primitive .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:And that all sorts of things , particularly in the tourist domain , can be represented in terms of uh source , path and goal . So the idea would be could we build an analyser that would take an utterance and say \" Aha ! th this utterance is talking about an attempt to reach a goal . The goal is this , the pers the , uh traveller is that , uh the sor w where we are at now is is this , they 've mentioned possible obstacles , et cetera . \" So th the {disfmarker} and this is an {disfmarker} again attempt to get very wide coverage . So if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:And then , uh The processing of that , both on the input end , recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals , et cetera , and on the output end , given this kind of information , you can then uh make decisions about what actions to take . Provides , they claim , a very powerful , general notion of deep semantics . So that 's what we 're really doing .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:And Nancy is going to {disfmarker} Her talk is going to be not about using this in applications , but about modeling how children might learn this kind of uh deep semantic grammar .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . Yep , yep . And how do you envision um the {disfmarker} the um this deep semantic to be worked with . Would it be highly ambiguous if and then there would be another module that takes that um highly underspecified deep semantic construction and map it onto the current context to find out what the person really was talking about in that context . or {disfmarker} or a {disfmarker}\nProfessor F:Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's where the belief - net comes in . So th the idea is , let 's take this business about going to the Powder - Tower .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:So part of what you 'll get out of this will be the fact tha w if it works right , OK , that this is an agent that wants to go to this place and that 's their goal\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:and there will be additional situational information .\nPhD A:Oh , OK .\nProfessor F:Uh , OK ,\nPhD A:th\nProfessor F:part of it comes from the ontology . The tower is this kind of object .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . Yeah , OK .\nProfessor F:Part of it comes from the user model .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:And the idea of the belief - net is it combines the information from the dialogue which comes across in this general way ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:you know this is a {disfmarker} this is a goal seeking behavior , along with specific information from the ontology about the kinds of objects involved\nPhD A:Yeah OK , Yeah , yep yep yep yep\nProfessor F:and about the situation about \" Is it raining ? \" I don't know . Whatever it is . And so that 's the belief - net that we 've laid out .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor F:And so th the coupling to the situation comes in this model from , at th at th at the belief - net , combining evidence from the dialogue with the ontology with the situation .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nGrad D:Hmm .\nProfessor F:But Nancy isn't gonna talk about that ,\nPhD A:Yeah , oh yeah , I see ,\nProfessor F:just about the um\nPhD A:yeah yeah , really .\nGrad B:First steps .\nProfessor F:Right . The {disfmarker} the construction grammar .\nGrad B:And she 's gonna start in a minute .\nProfessor F:In a minute .\nGrad D:Ah , OK .\nProfessor F:OK .\nPhD G:Is it i in , then , your place , in five {disfmarker} five - A ?\nPhD A:Alright .\n",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay . Right . Conceptual design meeting . Right . Okay , so {disfmarker} Right well um from the last meeting {vocalsound} I was trying to send you the minutes , but uh it didn't work out too well , so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh right , so {disfmarker} Wishing I hadn't closed the damn {disfmarker} Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements . And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . So . So basically what decisions uh have we uh made ? Uh have there been any uh changes ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think we all have a presentation again ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:so if we go through those and then um\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Three presentation , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} . Shall I go first again ? {gap}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} Yeah , fine .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I see {gap} this a little more smoothly than the last one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay right , let's get started . Um basically the uh for the {disfmarker} Um I'll {gap} back actually . For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . Then there is a chip and still the sender . So um yes {gap} including the power s supply as well . Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um . {vocalsound} There's a dynamo . Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up {gap} um . There's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . Um that's one option ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but I think that was gonna cost a little more . And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is {disfmarker} Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal {disfmarker} for like uh like modern computer . Um there's a scroll wheel which is {disfmarker} you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:You could do do that .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . Um moving on to the printed s\nProject Manager:What would be the cost do do we know ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um that's on the next {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . Um which is the next section . Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just {disfmarker} see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each . So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . And that's it .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:{gap} with the printed circuit boards you were going for the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Thanks . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into .\nProject Manager:But are we going f R right .\nIndustrial Designer:Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um .\nProject Manager:So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah . We decide . Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so would it not be best to {disfmarker} rather than {disfmarker} I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . The other way would be to do the presentation\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and then make the decision at that point in time .\nIndustrial Designer:Um . Maybe w\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .\nProject Manager:'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular {gap} and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:and then that would be the end of that issue . Does that make sense ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um I have a lot of the information there .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:It might not be very clear .\nIndustrial Designer:Is there {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Unless you want to plug it back in to yours .\nIndustrial Designer:Um . We could do , yeah . Um yeah we should {gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:it didn't {disfmarker} The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um .\nProject Manager:No the scroll wheel required the regular , so the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah if if you {gap} down um . It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:which is in the higher price range .\nProject Manager:Okay . The display requires an advanced chip\nUser Interface:I think the scroll wheel um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .\nIndustrial Designer:Also the display's for something else which we decided against . Um but that bit {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down .\nProject Manager:Down .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I I've got um pictures well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it ,\nProject Manager:Right . Okay .\nUser Interface:and they don't really look great .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So . So we're going for p Okay . So {gap} is um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , a simple pushbuttons .\nProject Manager:Simple push button . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? The um it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message um and replies to you .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So it is basically the concept we discussed before . Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm guessing it would , but {gap} got like the definite information . Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? Or are we going for the regular ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .\nProject Manager:Mm-mm . But is there any other {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean okay , that's true for the {disfmarker} for for that element , but we have to take all {gap} el elements into consideration . And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Hmm . But {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we {gap} m make a decision .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just {disfmarker} it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Oh yeah , I suppose so , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe that would be something separate , yeah .\nUser Interface:So I don't think it would effect our circuit board .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so we'd have a simple circuit board\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh that makes sense .\nUser Interface:And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo .\nProject Manager:Mm-mm .\nUser Interface:It might be useful to say like where are you remote . Here I am , Jo .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ?\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility .\nUser Interface:Yeah , just as a fun way to find it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um .\nProject Manager:Simple circuit board . Simple push button . Okay . W w kinetic .\nUser Interface:And it says that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .\nUser Interface:I think it said the cost of that isn't too much .\nIndustrial Designer:Um yeah I I thought so just for {disfmarker} just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:And how does it get uh charged up ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So the speech recognition was {disfmarker} Are we going for speech recognition ? No ? 'Cause that required the advanced {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um I think it would be helpful to find it , but I don't think it'd um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah I think {disfmarker} did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think so .\nMarketing:Just just for the call and find thing .\nIndustrial Designer:It was just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I had speech recognition requires advanced req require\nIndustrial Designer:Oh no th that's what that's what I thought , but maybe maybe it doesn't {gap} .\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I think I might have got that wrong .\nProject Manager:So okay .\nMarketing:'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it ,\nProject Manager:Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple .\nMarketing:it's not part of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah .\nProject Manager:And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . Would that be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay shall I pass on to you now ?\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:In fact , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ?\nUser Interface:I'll just just check what it said . Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so like it's already kind of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I assume it would cost extra , but {disfmarker} Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And then have to change all {vocalsound} change {gap} everything at the last minute .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . S\nUser Interface:Um . {vocalsound} Oh , that was quick . Um okay , so very brief presentation , um . From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . All of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons . Does that move it ?\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nUser Interface:It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I've found that {gap} try and get it back .\nIndustrial Designer:If you right click and then go onto a previous slide .\nUser Interface:Ah it's alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , right .\nUser Interface:Um . There wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . {vocalsound} Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . Um so that's a bit of competition there . So I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:rather than trying to compete with the functions . Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . And there's no real advantage and {disfmarker} because it impacts on other {disfmarker} on the materials and the price it's not great .\nIndustrial Designer:On the price , yeah .\nProject Manager:So you were saying the scroll buttons {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker} Yeah . Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Um but I don't know if that's really in our field ?\nIndustrial Designer:I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , {gap} maybe not ,\nUser Interface:But that's something that's out there .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ?\nProject Manager:Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a {disfmarker} You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . But that's really where your field is .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Is that\nUser Interface:Right well that's something that we can be aware of .\nProject Manager:So so what are we deciding to do here ?\nUser Interface:Um . I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function .\nProject Manager:Right . Mm-hmm . Uh the fi Yeah , the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . S s so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh yeah . Different languages might not be compatible .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . It w it would make it quite complicated ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , 'cause I think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:And you were talking\nUser Interface:Maybe unless something else comes up .\nProject Manager:Mm . And you were talking about scroll buttons ?\nUser Interface:Um yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:and give no real kinda extra benefit\nProject Manager:{gap} b\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .\nProject Manager:Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , was that right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes yes .\nUser Interface:Hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote .\nProject Manager:Okay . So not to be focused on .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . Um just to avoid ambiguity . So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume , {disfmarker} Um let's think how they did this .\nProject Manager:Good in in {disfmarker} Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down .\nUser Interface:I'm just gonna check so I do this right .\nProject Manager:An upside-down V_ . So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .\nUser Interface:Um . What did they say ? Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:Actually that can't be right , can it ? Oh well , no , they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So , be careful what you put on the buttons\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe we could have like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:and be careful of the shape that you make them ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I I know what you mean . So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You could have volume up and volume {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Possible .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} Volume up , down and {disfmarker} Like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:And 'cause the idea was to have limited um {disfmarker} it was to have sizable amount of information on it . Limited number of buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah {gap} .\nProject Manager:'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah we got it down to not too many .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um and I think that's all I had to say for that .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker} Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t\nMarketing:I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe we should see yours first .\nUser Interface:Oh okay .\nMarketing:Cool . Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one {disfmarker} that's the one I talked about last time , that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You know {gap} yourself . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:And second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . And apparently , the fashion trends {vocalsound} are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:which is contrary to last year , apparently . I presume it must have been not not spongy last year .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that . {vocalsound} Right , so that'll be it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Maybe a banana or courgette or something . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ?\nUser Interface:I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .\nProject Manager:Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people . And I would've thought the functionality {disfmarker} 'cause the people get cheesed off by things {disfmarker} by having to read instructions et cetera , so .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:.. .\nUser Interface:Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Maybe yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Now ? Yeah .\nUser Interface:And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and it wouldn't confuse the numbers .\nProject Manager:Stand-by button . No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,\nProject Manager:But what are they gonna be next {disfmarker} Yeah . What are they gonna be next year . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:maybe {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm . S\nProject Manager:But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh {vocalsound} I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah ,\nProject Manager:That means you're constantly changing your production schedule ,\nMarketing:I'm not {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest .\nMarketing:I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} to something which is maybe more universal .\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:um even if the design kind of changes , {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .\nProject Manager:Ah d d But if {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Well . Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe still with a rubber design we could {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this {disfmarker} Or was {disfmarker} the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? It was , wasn't it ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nUser Interface:And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um oh no no no\nUser Interface:Oh right , that fits , doesn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . That's the way round . If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . Which makes sense .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Rubber buttons require rubber case . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nUser Interface:And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Uh so , yeah . The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay {disfmarker} you want to basically mint them out\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and especially 'cause then you could make it something that {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Well , you might be limited in space , that {vocalsound} yes .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} would or not . Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:whether that would just increase the costs ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:make it more complicated .\nProject Manager:So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing .\nMarketing:That's possibly it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but you could change the the way it looked .\nUser Interface:Yeah and then you could have {disfmarker} Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's true .\nUser Interface:but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah you you could do a colour change , so therefore you would yeah yeah {disfmarker} I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in {disfmarker} rather than all in black\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:But uh so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So it is a possibility , um .\nUser Interface:But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ?\nProject Manager:Yes oh that's true\nUser Interface:We haven't really seen that yet\nIndustrial Designer:Oh okay yes\nProject Manager:uh that might no\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It might {disfmarker} and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things .\nProject Manager:Well not necessarily , because you could have your company uh {disfmarker} We're we're meant to be finishing up . You could have your company badge and logo . I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:'Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So .\nIndustrial Designer:And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ?\nMarketing:Yeah , I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing but I'm {disfmarker} Yeah . I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , people see you with it all about and\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I suppose ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .\nMarketing:i if it\nProject Manager:It's uh in in the house , isn't it , I suppose .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So don't change case .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Change case colour . And we're sort of saying no to that .\nUser Interface:Did we decide on the rubber case ? The spongy feel , or did we think that that might go as a trend ?\nMarketing:Well , it was different last year . The trend was different last year apparently . It was not not spongy feel . But {disfmarker} I don't know whether the trend will change . I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , less likely to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Sounds reasonable . {vocalsound} {gap} If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases\nIndustrial Designer:So then th th that would {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so that you could {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and then have the standard rubber buttons as well .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nUser Interface:Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . There's flat ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:there's single-curved and there's double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer:Um . Mayb\nUser Interface:I'm not exactly sure what these things look like .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well it says that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:When you say d when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ?\nUser Interface:I'm not exactly sure . {vocalsound} Um I'll show you the remotes that I've got .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:See how uh {disfmarker} Let's just get that bigger . See how uh the one {disfmarker} Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ?\nMarketing:No you're not connected to me anymore . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That doesn't help . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:One one thing to cons\nUser Interface:Shall I just turn it round for time ?\nProject Manager:one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um {disfmarker} by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other\nMarketing:{gap} That should come up .\nProject Manager:therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can {disfmarker} if you can store them up on top of each other .\nMarketing:Mm {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Whereas if you do um fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that . And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um it's not very clear up there ,\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there .\nProject Manager:Mm yep .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:I'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's what I was trying to work out .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there .\nProject Manager:Oh right . S so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ?\nMarketing:Shall we\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so .\nUser Interface:Definitely a single , maybe a double .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay , so shall we quickly {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?\nIndustrial Designer:We'll go for single curve , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Single curve .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:curved or double curved ? So it's single curved .\nIndustrial Designer:So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? The one you move around ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah I think that think that's a good idea .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface:And the rubber push buttons , rubber case .\nMarketing:Rubber {disfmarker} Rubber buttons and case .\nUser Interface:Um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we ,\nIndustrial Designer:Oh we ca\nUser Interface:but possibly a sticker .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah , we'll still have the {disfmarker} Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated {gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board .\nProject Manager:Yes . Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to {disfmarker} that we seemed to leave out .\nMarketing:Okay . And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . {vocalsound} Or veg .\nUser Interface:Yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years . Uh what sort of shape do we want ?\nProject Manager:So we've got spongy feel buttons as well , have we ?\nMarketing:Don't know , maybe just\nProject Manager:As well as {disfmarker} or w or was that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . That's ru rubber buttons , yeah .\nProject Manager:So it's rubber buttons ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it was just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . With a rubber case right ?\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , so it's not too wacky .\nMarketing:Reasonably spongy I guess , yeah .\nProject Manager:And the standby button is gonna be different .\nMarketing:Yeah okay .\nUser Interface:Um I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape . If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay so what what shape are we making the standby button ?\nMarketing:Yeah {gap} . Apple ?\nProject Manager:A apple .\nUser Interface:Vote ?\nProject Manager:Oh oh {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Shall we vote on it ?\nIndustrial Designer:We will go for the a a a apples apples .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Anyone got any suggestions ?\nMarketing:Apple apple a a qu Quite a big one , as well .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay . Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} A big apple . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well it could be red .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:Could be a red apple , yeah . Either , don't mind .\nProject Manager:A red apple ? Is it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , once we find out um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . And then we're gonna {disfmarker} are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? Just like the {disfmarker} Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah that seems pretty straight forward .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Sorry what was that last thing again there ?\nUser Interface:Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .\nProject Manager:Right {gap} much option on that . I thought you were going for a single curve and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ah just the uh shape of the buttons .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:And j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . Fairly sort of self explanatory .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right , so shape of buttons simple . Okay . So that's that , I guess . We should now go away and get these things sorted out . {gap} I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , so um .\nIndustrial Designer:Is that the end ? Okay .\nMarketing:Looks like it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\n",
        "summary": "The project manager gave a brief review of the last meeting. After the Industrial Designer's presentation about the components of the remote and team's discussion about it, the team agreed that the kinetic power supply, simple push buttons and a simple circuit board and a finder feature are better choices for the remote. Then, the team discussed the design of the remote. They made the decision that standard rubber case and rubber buttons and a single curve are better choices for the remote, and the shape of buttons should be simple.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Uh it fell off . One , two , three , four , yeah , we're ready . Okay . Welcome to this second meeting . Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . This is a meeting on functional design . Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . Um I did {disfmarker} took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's {disfmarker} I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . Okay ? Is this ap everybody agree with this ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oops .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . {vocalsound} Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . And go to that one . Um as you can see it was this earlier today . Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting {vocalsound} Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I think so ,\nProject Manager:Did I miss something ?\nIndustrial Designer:we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I'm afraid I incorporated {vocalsound} that when I said who was present , but {disfmarker} yes , we did ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , I accept the minutes .\nProject Manager:but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . So um as a group I think we've {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} they're accepting the minutes . And uh {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing:Is that what we're supposed to say ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I do .\nProject Manager:Good . Um , then we'll move to the three presentations . Okay ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . Mm we need to move this . Who wants to go f first ? {vocalsound} That's as far as it goes .\nUser Interface:Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . Oh it doesn't have any on , does it ? That's fine .\nMarketing:Excellent , thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Oy , big loop under the table .\nProject Manager:She said we didn't need to screw it in .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay , that looks good .\nProject Manager:It's doing its thing . There we are .\nMarketing:Alright . Thank you very much . Um . One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar {disfmarker} of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players {disfmarker} although it makes immediate sense to {vocalsound} have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh {disfmarker} will only benefit from the positive feedback {vocalsound} from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um {vocalsound} fifty percent {disfmarker} I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this {vocalsound} there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .\nIndustrial Designer:Could {disfmarker} can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .\nProject Manager:Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:um that teletext is outdated um\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Well I think we can {disfmarker} I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise {vocalsound} for the I go everywhere line .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . So these market research uh uh questionnaires {vocalsound} looked into your your uh concern about technology\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them {vocalsound} would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if {disfmarker} and you know , the the designers ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is that a large enough target market to target it ?\nMarketing:Well , I I I think {disfmarker} especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . To {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um yes .\nProject Manager:Or eight million .\nMarketing:Yes . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:that's a that's a very good question .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:but I think it's an interesting {disfmarker} I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research\nMarketing:Shall I go back ?\nUser Interface:on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples ,\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ?\nMarketing:Exactly . I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something {disfmarker} uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sh surely he's in the wrong age group .\nMarketing:You know ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:it's {disfmarker} I a and I think , you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:He must be w one of a s small population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No , no ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:you {disfmarker} Kate , you're exactly right there . {vocalsound} But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen ,\nMarketing:Uh , mm .\nProject Manager:that's looking at age groups .\nMarketing:Exactly . I {vocalsound} yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar {disfmarker} younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable ,\nProject Manager:Leap . {vocalsound} Hmm . Mm .\nMarketing:you know , um so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , you had the other power channel .\nMarketing:I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . {vocalsound} And this is this is also supported by the market research .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Thank you . That's my contribution .\nProject Manager:Alright . And we'll turn to the next presentation . I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in . And then press , what ? F F_N_ and F_ eight . Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top .\nUser Interface:Yeah , press them .\nProject Manager:And then w be patient . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , here we go .\nProject Manager:Tada .\nIndustrial Designer:And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there .\nUser Interface:Can I not just uh do each one in order ?\nIndustrial Designer:I you can if you like , it it {disfmarker} that that just sets it up to do a p a p\nProject Manager:There we are . Yay .\nUser Interface:That ?\nIndustrial Designer:no that one , that one there .\nUser Interface:That ?\nIndustrial Designer:Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep .\nUser Interface:That ? Right , technical functions design . Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control .\nProject Manager:T_V_ only .\nUser Interface:So these are two models of existing remote controls . Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Ugh .\nUser Interface:It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has {disfmarker} seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has {disfmarker} it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access {disfmarker} it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .\nProject Manager:Mm . And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us .\nUser Interface:So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just {disfmarker} want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:o I was thinking something {disfmarker} some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility .\nProject Manager:Okay . Any uh thing else you wanna add ?\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:But we could go back to the pictures of the {disfmarker} uh , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them ,\nMarketing:Or if {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but {vocalsound} maybe should hear what Kate has to say first .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say .\nUser Interface:Okay then .\nMarketing:Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that {disfmarker} your {disfmarker} the one on the right as a as a basis .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Whiteboard session .\nProject Manager:I think the white {disfmarker} that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Definitely less cluttered and {disfmarker} I mean but still it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's there\nUser Interface:Sorry\nProject Manager:but it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I was just {disfmarker} I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:The the style of these is terrible .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:The ergonomics , the way it fits in your {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:So that's that for now .\nIndustrial Designer:Cheers . Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Still , I'll do without that . Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . {vocalsound} Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , {vocalsound} and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . {vocalsound} And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and {disfmarker} which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the {disfmarker} which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now I would have hoped {disfmarker} I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . {vocalsound} So we want an energy source which is there . And we've got to think about what that might be .\nProject Manager:Hmm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . {vocalsound} Um and then we have the the user interface . Oops . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound} Okay . Right . But those things {disfmarker} as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of {disfmarker} what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um {disfmarker} because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million of 'em ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:you just {disfmarker} if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need {disfmarker} gonna need to hit .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Whoop .\nMarketing:Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Isn't that your job ?\nMarketing:Because then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh right .\nMarketing:the chip composer marketing . Oh no , the chip composer sender .\nProject Manager:Mm . What they cost .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna {vocalsound} give me some advice on that , if you're asking me ,\nMarketing:I I don't believe I know , um .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the {disfmarker} which is pretty much the same as these existing models ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:just maybe a little bit more inspired ,\nMarketing:Inspired ?\nUser Interface:but basically just the same .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:You could {disfmarker} you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries ,\nMarketing:Well\nUser Interface:which are {disfmarker}\nMarketing:that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you {disfmarker} then it has a place .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , but it also has a place ,\nUser Interface:And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa .\nMarketing:so {disfmarker} exactly .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's a really good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . {vocalsound} I'll do some research for the next meeting .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well it's better than my idea about solar , probably . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Well it is just so annoying how {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Depen\nProject Manager:It would have to sor store up the energy\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I guess .\nProject Manager:and then use it . Solar can do that .\nIndustrial Designer:We may be talking quite heavy then .\nProject Manager:M yeah , that would be too heavy\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and it'd cost too much .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably {disfmarker} I mean it might cost more to {disfmarker} at first to develop and to install ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm\nUser Interface:but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and\nIndustrial Designer:So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ?\nUser Interface:you know f\nMarketing:Definitely ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} loss and breakage of um remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:exactly .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent .\nMarketing:Exactly .\nUser Interface:Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Mm . 'Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end .\nMarketing:Well I I brought up some {disfmarker} exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nMarketing:You know ,\nIndustrial Designer:I was wondering that ,\nMarketing:these are the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy {vocalsound} something new ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I I s usually put more money than brains .\nMarketing:Yeah , exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that ,\nMarketing:Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment .\nIndustrial Designer:are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It might be good to know um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , good point . Yeah , yeah okay , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , good point .\nUser Interface:That's probably more what it is .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:What would be a more efficient way of doing it ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay . Right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Probably not .\nUser Interface:are we ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n {vocalsound} definitely we wanna be inspired that the current {vocalsound} styles are just plain awful .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Do we need {disfmarker} um let me {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is that agreeable to everyone ?\nMarketing:Br actually , um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:the enter key {disfmarker} I have a chart here that I didn't include . Um\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Do you want the gizmo ?\nMarketing:yeah , which might {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Throw some light on that .\nMarketing:Th yeah , th those are {disfmarker} {vocalsound} felt like had a lot of charts . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay , I I {disfmarker} my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only {disfmarker} just really in terms of streamlining .\nProject Manager:Ah . Mm-hmm . Okay . Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Exactly . Again , you know ,\nProject Manager:Is that okay with you ?\nMarketing:thinking of menus or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Sorry ,\nProject Manager:Would that {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:H how does that work ?\nUser Interface:I was miles away .\nIndustrial Designer:How {disfmarker} so so how does that work ,\nUser Interface:I was re I was reading the chart to be honest .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um well\nProject Manager:uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ?\nMarketing:if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Then you'd have to have an off te off key .\nMarketing:so you press power after you've um {disfmarker} well I was thinking maybe you {disfmarker} to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yep , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not getting a bit complicated ? Could granny do this ,\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:or are we just not aiming at granny ?\nMarketing:Or y yeah . Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Who's got an iPod then ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Mm . Okay .\nMarketing:I don't {disfmarker} um I wish . Anyway , uh {vocalsound} that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:It's definitely channel , volume , power .\nUser Interface:Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself ,\nMarketing:Exactly .\nUser Interface:like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself .\nMarketing:Exactly .\nUser Interface:I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant .\nProject Manager:Okay . So\nMarketing:Okay , well . Thanks for looking at that .\nProject Manager:I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:We don't wanna outsmart {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I just joined that set last week .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} first grandchild arrived .\nMarketing:Congratulations . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:Um so are we agreed then of those things ? And let's go back to agenda\nMarketing:D\nProject Manager:and hook me up . Mm . This oughta be fun . It probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like a g mess . Come on . Uh it lost it off here . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh you're fine . It's fine .\nProject Manager:No , it was up there , but I couldn't see it down here . Mm . This time it should be both . There we go .\nIndustrial Designer:How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ?\nProject Manager:Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to {disfmarker} five minutes to finish ,\nIndustrial Designer:Ah okay , it toggles through ,\nProject Manager:thank you a lot for telling me .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um right ,\nMarketing:I think you have to cycle through .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:we're ready to close . Um {gap} will be completed q questionnaire , um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching . Um and each of us will get help from our coach . Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sounds good .\nProject Manager:Then that's the end of this meeting . And I hope that's good enough for her {vocalsound} to tell her that's the end . Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though .\nProject Manager:Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them .\nUser Interface:Alright , well that's fine then .\nProject Manager:Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them .\nMarketing:Okay . Um and you'd mentioned {disfmarker} I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:because it {disfmarker} they were {disfmarker} it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um the teletext is outdated ,\nIndustrial Designer:So we're still in meeting , aren't we ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:the internet is important ,\nMarketing:Yeah , I think I've {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph .\nUser Interface:Mm . Sorry , what what actually are these {disfmarker} is that the yellow and black ?\nProject Manager:It doesn't tell me .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:From their {disfmarker} I'll just use it from their website .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Right . Thank you .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting mainly focused on the functional design of the remote control. After Project Manager reviewed the last meeting briefly, Marketing made a presentation about re-envisioning the menu functionality, current technology, and interaction with other tools of the remote control by discarding unnecessary buttons and adding the speech recognition to the remote control according to market research. User Interface argued that they should discard the existing standard, and only keep the basic and user-friendly functions like channel selection, volume and enter key. The group then discussed the source of power whether to have a charger or solar power. Although solar energy was fancy and environmentally friendly, the cost was much higher than using a charger. The group faced some difficulty when deciding the target group whether for the young end or for the lower end of the age range who have more money than sense. In the next part, the group reached a consensus in terms of the keys of the remote control, which is power, channel, volume, enter, number.",

        "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Okay. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and Jack Sargeant and I'm very pleased to welcome Jayne Bryant back, who is substituting for Jack today. Are there any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2, then, this morning, is our sixth scrutiny session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome our witnesses this morning: Sally Jenkins, who is chair of All Wales Heads of Children\u2019s Services and is here representing the Association of Directors of Social Services; Alastair Birch, who is senior system leader for equalities and safeguarding at Pembrokeshire County Council, who is here representing the Association of Directors of Education Wales; and Councillor Huw David, who is the Welsh Local Government Association spokesperson for health and social care and leader of Bridgend County Borough Council. So, thank you all for attending this morning. We're very pleased to have you here. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so, if you're happy, we'll go straight into questions and I'll start just by asking about your general support for the Bill, which is outlined in the evidence. Can you just explain why you think the current law is ineffective or unclear?\nAlastair Birch:Bore da\u2014bore da, bawb. So, I'm Alastair Birch. The statement, really, from ADEW is that the rights of the child should be educated and achieved, really, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The current legislation has been criticised, obviously, by the UN concerning the defence of reasonable punishment still being within our current legislation. So, we will always\u2014ADEW will always\u2014advocate that the rights of the child be upheld, so that is really the fundamental aspect in terms of the statement from ADEW, and the position of ADEW is that the rights of the child are fundamental in this process. And there are certain articles\u2014. I know that the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 made sure that article 3 and article 4, article 12 and article 37 were a focus in terms of making sure that the best interests of the child were put first, that children expressing their views and opinions was a priority. And we know, for safeguarding purposes, that the express opinions of the child and the voice of the child are a fundamental aspect of any safe environment, whether it be a school or college. So, that is\u2014the position is really following that legal position under the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Nothing to add at this stage, no?\nSally Jenkins:I'll just add, on behalf of ADSS and on behalf of children's services and social services more widely, for us, this is not a change in our position, this is not new; this is a position that we, on behalf of the leaders of social services across Wales, have taken over many years, going back 20, 25 years. I think what we would say is that we really welcome this Bill and we welcome the proposed change for the clarity it would bring\u2014the clarity that it would bring for children, for parents and for professionals. I think what we would recognise is that this is a very little-used piece of legislation, so it's rare, it's not as if this is something that is going to cast great change across the scene for children and families in Wales, but what it will do is represent a change in the reality of how we care and nurture our children. I would echo absolutely what Alastair has said in terms of the rights of the child, but equally, in terms of all of our policies in Wales in terms of promoting well-being for children, this has to be key. So, for us, this is about a natural progression of change in how we care for our children in Wales. For children's services at the very sharp end of this world, for us, it brings a true clarity. This continues with an ambiguity in how we treat our children and how we care for our children, and the shift for us brings that very much needed clarity.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. The committee has already heard different views about whether there's clear evidence that physical punishment is harmful to children. What evidence does the work of social services provide about whether physical punishment is actually harmful?\nSally Jenkins:Obviously, what you'll all be aware of is that, as part of the consultation for this Bill, the Public Policy Institute did a further piece of research to look at the impact of physical punishment on children. A number of things that we know\u2014we know from across the world that the evidence is that introducing legislation or changing legislation in this way improves children's positions within their families. What we know is that children themselves, as Alastair has already referred to, really find physical punishment demeaning and harmful, and for children it is an emotionally damaging experience. Now, there may be disagreement about that, there will be different views on that, but that's the voice of the child in this debate. The voice of the child is very clear that physical punishment is for them harmful. I think what we would also say is that, in the world that we work in, it's part of a continuum, and, whilst this is an element of how children are cared for, what we see is a continuum where an acceptance of how we treat children in a particular way perpetuates throughout our work. By changing this, it helps that shift to that absolute recognition that our children must be cared for in a way that is physically safe in all dimensions for them.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. We've had evidence from the equal protection network that the reasonable punishment defence undermines child protection and fails to protect children because it permits an arbitrary level of violence, which invades children's physical integrity, making it a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse, and you did refer to that just now. Is there anything you want to add on that?\nSally Jenkins:I would echo that. I think there is something in this that is about our culture, about how we see our children. It is about how we see our smallest and most vulnerable people, and if it is acceptable it opens the door to those other, more extreme versions of violence, which then complicates the issue for us. This is about clarity, and, whilst there is an argument that this is a small episode for a child, it's not a small episode for a child, it is a major episode for a child, and I think absolutely, as you said, the potential for it then to lead on, and over gradation and time to increase the risk for children, is clearly there.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. The final question from me: your written evidence emphasises the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, but that contrasts with what we've been told by the children's commissioner and the equal protection network, who've emphasised the importance of simplicity in the Bill. How do you respond to that view, and is what you're calling for essential to be on the face of the Bill?\nSally Jenkins:It's not essential for it to be on the face of the Bill. What we would like to see is discussion within the implementation phase for that nuancing. Absolutely agree in terms of simplicity\u2014I think that is really important\u2014and I've already mentioned clarity. What we don't want to do is further confuse the position. We know that the legislation in different countries has done that, and there are ways that you can do it, but what we would welcome is an opportunity during the implementation phase for discussion.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you.\nHuw David:And, as a principle, obviously we would welcome full involvement, and we know there's the commitment from Welsh Government to full involvement in the implementation, because, as with every piece of legislation, implementation is the most important part, and we would want to ensure there is that commitment to a major awareness-raising campaign, and there is that from Welsh Government, because we need to take families, carers and parents with us on this. Also we need to ensure that there is that support available to parents and carers that do sometimes struggle with parenting, and that needs to be a universal offer across Wales. If we're to progress with this, that has to be an option that is offered to every parent in Wales.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you.\nSally Jenkins:Local authorities have already been very heavily involved in terms of looking at this Bill and exploring what the issues are and the discussions and looking at what the implications from a local authority perspective will be, as Huw describes, both in terms of the awareness raising, early support and intervention and prevention services for families against the backdrop of the current issues that we have in local government, but also awareness raising\u2014because absolutely it is key that families come with us on this journey. This is not an imposition. This is embracing a culture and a value system for our children.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. I've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden on the implementation of the Bill.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. So, you've pre-empted me, Huw.\nHuw David:Right. Sorry. I've got good eyesight; I can't see\u2014. [Laughter.]\nDawn Bowden AM:You've already said, obviously, that you're looking towards working with Welsh Government in terms of its implementation. What's been your role so far in terms of the implementation of the Bill\u2014local authorities generally, now? Have you had a role? Has Welsh Government been involving you in discussions around the introduction of the Bill so far?\nHuw David:Yes. So, obviously we were consulted\u2014a key consultee\u2014but also our officials have worked very closely with Welsh Government officials to make sure this is implemented successfully, if it is progressed.\nSally Jenkins:Our involvement with this, from a social services perspective, goes back over two years, directly in working towards this point, never mind the history in terms of work towards this area. But, very directly in relation to this Bill, we were first involved at least two years ago, to recollect, and that was in a series of workshops with other agencies, for example Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru and the police, and looking in real depth at what the implications would be for us as agencies to look at what the likely trajectory would be in terms of our pathways for referral into our services and what that might mean for us. And then particularly, for example, with CAFCASS Cymru in relation to private law, what the fallout might be, and then what, if anything\u2014and that's the discussion that we need to have\u2014that could mean for children's services in particular, given the pressures that we're already under. So, we've been in constant, I suppose, involvement in terms of the Bill already, as part of the consultation, in terms of the focus groups and in terms of direct work with Welsh Government officials to take this forward. And we are absolutely committed to continuing with that work.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. You touched there on the pressures that you're already under, which we fully appreciate, but you also mentioned in answers to Lynne Neagle earlier on that you welcomed the Bill in terms of its clarity. So, are you confident that the Bill can be implemented without any major impact on your capacity to deal with it?\nSally Jenkins:We've done\u2014. A number of local authorities\u2014my own included, Newport City Council, has done some work to look at what the likely impact would be and then actually to look at what some of that costing would need to be. Further work is needed on that area, and that needs to be carried out during the implementation phase. I think what we've done is we've looked internationally at what the impact has been elsewhere when similar legislation has been introduced to try and gauge, but that's difficult to do in terms of comparable nations and size and also different systems. And obviously our approach in terms of children and pedagogy is very different from some of the nations that have already done this. I wouldn't like to say one way or the other, because I think, in terms of that culture shift, it could be a double impact on us in terms of increased referrals because of increased awareness, but it could also be, I suppose, as Huw alludes to, that, if we're looking at ensuring greater awareness of preventative services and support services for parents, actually people coming to the fore and asking us for those services as well. So, at this stage, I think what we would want to say is that we continue to be fully involved in the implementation phase, to look at what the cost implications for that could be, and not just for the local authorities but also the police, CAFCASS Cymru, for third sector organisations involved in preventative services. I don't think any of that should undermine the position in terms of children and their rights within our society. So, a difficult answer, in the sense that\u2014\nDawn Bowden AM:No, I understand. What you're saying is that this is a piece of legislation that, in your view, is a good piece of legislation. It's setting out to, hopefully, achieve what the purpose of it is and you will deliver what you need to. Can I ask you whether, then, you've also given thought to the impact on\u2014we've talked about social services, but the impact on other services, like housing, education and so on? You're obviously coming at it from slightly different angles in other sections.\nAlastair Birch:We are part of the universal service for children, and we very much work in co-operation with the WLGA and our social care colleagues, and we've been part of that consultation. In terms of education, the main changes, or adaptations, would be around training and awareness. And, in terms of the Bill, there needs to be the clarity\u2014ambiguity would be bad\u2014in terms of making sure that safeguarding leads within all schools have the right training and support. So, really, that's the key element there, and then obviously the preventative services for the parents that schools can signpost, and sometimes possibly even host, in terms of being community schools. These positive parenting approaches that\u2014. I have colleagues who have worked in that area for many years and see the benefits in how those positive parenting approaches make a difference to families.\nDawn Bowden AM:So, from your point of view, it's awareness raising, is it?\nAlastair Birch:It's awareness raising; it's making sure that professionals are fully briefed on necessary changes, that there's very little ambiguity, that we are aware that\u2014. We still have that duty to report whenever there is any safeguarding concern. That'll still be part of the all-Wales child protection procedures.\u00a0That won't change, and that duty is always going to be there for all our professionals. But that awareness raising and training will be the key, and then, obviously, working in co-operation with our colleagues.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay, I understand that. Have you been given an indication of how long you've got between Royal Assent and implementation, and whether you've thought through any of the key milestones that need to be implemented?\nSally Jenkins:There's a group proposed that would be a strategic leadership group in the steering group that we're part of, which is now laying out what would happen after Royal Assent if that is given. So, we will work towards that.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. My final question, Chair, is about some of the responses we've had to this committee that say that the state should not get involved in family life\u2014I'm sure you've heard those views\u2014unless it's in the most serious circumstances. To what extent do you think that this Bill undermines the existing local authority responsibilities, or don't you?\nHuw David:The state's paramount role is to protect children from harm. That is our legal responsibility, it's our moral responsibility, and we will discharge that. And there is obviously a view\u2014it's a view that is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\u2014that physical punishment, physical harm to a child is harm to a child, and we should be preventing that and act to prevent that. That would be the position of the Welsh Local Government Association, and we also respect the mandate that Members of the National Assembly for Wales have too. And we believe that children can be raised by parents without recourse to physical punishment, effectively, and we'd support parents in that. We do not believe that in the 50 nations across the world where such legislation exists that the state is interfering in family life unnecessarily. We believe this action reflects a cultural change, a sea change that's taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years, where the vast majority of parents now say that they do not use it themselves, they do not support it, and we believe this is actually a reflection of what has happened in Welsh society. We support Assembly Members in the view that the natural progression of that is that children's rights are protected across Wales.\nDawn Bowden AM:So, I've got largely positive feedback from you in terms of the Bill and its intentions, and so on. Do you foresee any unintended consequences for this Bill?\nHuw David:If we implement it carefully, if we implement it with the right resources, then I hope not. I think not. But as with every piece of legislation, it is about the implementation, it is about the cultural change as well, and that's why I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that resources are made available, because our social services departments\u2014children's social services in particular\u2014are overstretched. They are at breaking point\u2014make no bones about it\u2014and they are dealing with children who are facing serious harm and neglect. We are having record numbers of contacts from police, from teachers, from doctors and, of course, from children themselves who are experiencing that harm and neglect. And obviously, we want to focus our energy and our attention on those children. Equally, though, we don't want to lose sight of those families and children that are experiencing significant problems, but who we want to support through our early intervention and prevention programmes, and that is why it is important that there is investment in those programmes, so that children do not end up in that terrible position where we have to, for their safety, take them from their birth families to protect them. And the reality is, in Wales, that we are doing that to more children than we've done for a long time, and the numbers are growing across Wales. And that is only because of the most appalling neglect and abuse, because there is no way that any judge would permit us to act to make a child safe if it was not for that fact, and the facts are there. So, I don't want that focus to be lost, but, of course, we welcome and understand the need to progress this piece of legislation.\nDawn Bowden AM:That rise that you talk about here, is that due to more interventions, greater awareness, more incidents? I'm trying to link this to the Bill in terms of whether the Bill is actually going to give you more work to do in those areas.\nSally Jenkins:On the reasons for the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales, which are higher than those in England, and also the numbers of contacts that we have across the local authorities, the work of the care crisis review, which was completed last year; the work of Isabelle Trowler, who's the chief social worker in England; countless research and reports that have taken place in the last 18 months; and currently the public law working group, under the auspices of the president of the family court, would all indicate that it's multifactorial. So, what you have is a range of reasons that have led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across England and Wales. What you can't do is identify a single reason. There have been headlines that have said, 'Is it increased austerity?' That is clearly a part of this. Is it in Wales an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of, for example, domestic abuse? Is it because of our understanding of what happens to children in those households? All of that research would say it's all of those things. And then, when you also add in changes in our practice with our colleagues in the judiciary, changes in our police service, but also changes in our preventative services, you've got that whole range of elements. And there is going on across the local authorities and Welsh Government a huge amount of work to try to address and understand that, and then to ameliorate that. Children who need to be in care for safety need to be in care, but what we have to do is get to a point where fewer children come into care and we're able to protect them, firstly, and secondly where those children who are in care are cared for in a way that delivers the best possible outcomes for them. So, there is no simple answer unfortunately. I think, in terms of this Bill and unintended consequences, I agree absolutely with everything that Huw has said. My job is around children at that far end, but what this Bill does is it brings clarity. It brings a clarity even for those children at that very far end. It takes away even that point of discussion that this could possibly be okay, and I think that's important to hang on to.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. Sorry.\nAlastair Birch:One unintended consequences is that I think that there will be an increased focus on the UNCRC. And, in terms of children having a discussion around this point, children need to be part of that discussion. It's something that affects them. And a key aspect of education is the voice of the child. It has become significantly\u2014. It's changed completely in the last 10 years, and it is\u00a0one of the key things in terms of us driving improvements.\nDawn Bowden AM:Would that be something that you would be looking to do in schools?\nAlastair Birch:Anything that improves the voice of the child in any educational context is good and it's very powerful for the children. And it improves their educational experiences, encouraging the opportunities for them to discuss the issues, the adverse childhood experiences that they encounter, which are significant, and it's our educational professionals that are facing this day-in, day-out. They've become a very highly trained workforce, they're ACE aware, they're trauma aware, and anything that focuses, even increases, their professionalism and understanding around a particular point, and also\u2014. So it's a positive unintended consequence, shall we say, that it could reinvigorate some of the voice of the child discussion within various contexts.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:We've got some specific questions now on implementation for social services, from Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you, Chair. If this Bill becomes law, would you encourage members of the public to contact social services departments if they do see a child being smacked?\nSally Jenkins:We already encourage members of the public to contact social services or the police, depending on the circumstances. Interestingly, I'm picking\u2014\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:What, if a child is being smacked now?\nSally Jenkins:Yes. If a child is being smacked now, we would ask that people contact. We have a duty to report, as professionals. But if you were walking out, and you saw something happening to a child, in the same way as if you saw something to an adult.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Right.\nSally Jenkins:So, I think that the challenge is about\u2014we've all probably, sadly, witnessed incidents in the doctor's reception, or in a supermarket, and we've failed to do something about it. And I think we then walk away and feel pretty guilty about that, realistically, when you see something happening to a child in a particular circumstance. I think we can't ignore the fact that a child is being assaulted in those circumstances.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Okay. Thank you. A campaign opposing this Bill, Be Reasonable Wales, have said that 'If the law is changed, the consequences for parents will be considerable.' It also says, 'Anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child\u2014under the new definition\u2014' so, I suppose you could argue, a minor tap\u2014 'will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma.' To what extent is this accurate, and, also, will thresholds for social services intervention change if the Bill is enacted?\nSally Jenkins:There are a number of parts to that. Firstly, in terms of long-term social services intervention in a family's life, I think, for people to be fully aware of the very few numbers of families where we have long-term intervention currently, even where there is what would be perceived as very significant abuse. What we do is we go in for short periods in families' lives, to support them to work with their strengths, to work with them and their family members. It's not about us going into families, whatever some of the public perception may be. Our aim is to get in and get out. So, in terms of long-term intervention, what we want is for families to find their own solutions. We want families to be able to work with each other, and together, and local community support, and preventative services, to be able to address issues. This is not about punitive approaches from social services. So, that's the first element. In terms of thresholds for children's services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. There may be a small number of referrals that come through. What we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle. We recognise that's likely to happen. Because we also know that this is actually quite a rare occurrence currently; this is not a defence that's being used with great frequency, this is not something that is happening. And if we look at the data, we know that the incidents of children, and the number of parents who now recognise this as an acceptable form of punishment, has steadily declined over the last 15 to 20 years. So it's diminishing as it is.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:So, on that one then, is there a need for legislation that will\u2014obviously there'll be resources for the Welsh Government and there'll be resources out of hours and things like that\u2014is there a need for legislation if, as you say, natural behaviour and the culture is changing? Let's be honest, as you've rightly pointed out, in social services\u2014I know in my own authority\u2014in your own authority, you're saying that even now you're working with the police, on systematic failings within the system.\nSally Jenkins:Two things. Firstly, we want legislation that reflects our society\u2014we don't want the two to be out of kilter. That would be my first natural response: surely our legislation should be reflective of what our world is. It shouldn't be that we've got these rather confusing elements running in parallel, and that continues to perpetuate a lack of clarity and the ambiguity that we currently see. I think the other element is that, again, this is about potentially an accelerating of that awareness and that culture in our society, about how we care for our children. We've got there naturally; we've got there by the change that's happened in Wales over the last 15 to 20 years. What this does is to continue with that change and continue with that awareness and understanding of how we positively, from a strength-based approach, should care for our children, bearing in mind what's required of us in terms of the UNCRC.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Okay. Are there any comments from anyone else?\nHuw David:Simply to say that I think that, in terms of that clarity for the very vulnerable children out there who are currently being assaulted\u2014seriously assaulted and abused by their parents, which goes on on a daily basis\u2014that is already covered by existing legislation. But at the moment, they don't know, because they could be being told\u2014and they probably are being told\u2014by their parents that's it's okay, that they can smack their child and that that's acceptable. They don't know the difference. A young child is not going to know that difference and there is confusion about what is\u2014. And if you asked most parents, and in fact lots of professionals, they would not be able to tell you, and probably most of you wouldn't be able to tell me exactly where is the threshold\u2014\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Yes, where's that line.\nHuw David:Well, at the moment, we don't know where that line is. That vulnerable child, at home, being abused by their parents, does not know where that line is. And they should know where that line is because then they can pick up the phone to Childline or they can talk to a professional and ask them where that line is. So, that would be a step forward. I do recognise, though, that what we don't want to do\u2014and the last thing any of us want to do\u2014is criminalise parents who are bringing up their children. That is why we're saying there needs to be an emphasis on the support programmes that are available to parents. And to be clear, there is no way that we want long-term involvement in any child's life, but particularly not in the lives of children who have been smacked by their parents. That is not going to be the result of this legislation, trust me, because we don't want to be involved in\u2014we haven't got the resources to be involved in children's lives. The social worker or the police officer\u2014if they become involved, then there would be a proportionate response to that, and there'll also be a test about whether or not that is progressed. So, if there is an allegation\u2014if this legislation is passed\u2014then that will be looked into and a consideration will be made about whether any action will be taken, and as with any allegation of the law being broken, there would be a proportionate response, as there is now.\nLynne Neagle AM:And the next question does relate to the practical response to that. Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Yes. Can you outline the practical ways in which social services' interaction with parents will change as a result of this proposed law and do you envisage that all referrals to the police will be automatically referred to social services for an assessment? Who's going to make those decisions?\nSally Jenkins:That will be part of the implementation phase about that decision making. Interestingly, the number of referrals that we currently get from the police that we take absolutely no action on is extraordinary. So, we get a very, very large number of\u2014. It will be happening now; sitting in the civic centre in Newport City Council will be a whole host of social workers taking in the public protection notifications from overnight. It's 10 o'clock, so they're assessing them now, as we speak. And an awful lot of those will have no further action from the local authority.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:But will they be investigated?\nSally Jenkins:No. There will be no action. There are countless referrals made by agencies to local authorities that we take no action on.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:So, if there's an increase as a result\u00a0of greater awareness\u2014\nSally Jenkins:What happens is there is a paper assessment of them. There's a look at what's happened, who's involved, what the police have reported, and there's work being done with the police to improve that. Because one of the things that we want to get to is actually where we're not using huge amounts of time to look at that, but what comes to us is what we act on. So, there is work going on with a number of police authorities to look at how you improve that process. But I suppose, to pick up, each incident will be looked at, each one will be assessed in a way that is proportionate, as Huw says, to look at what's happened and then investigated.\nLynne Neagle AM:Sally, can you give us a couple of examples of what kind of things might have come in that you would then take no action on?\nSally Jenkins:We get countless referrals, for example, where there's been a domestic abuse incident overnight where a child wasn't present in the property and we then haven't taken action. It\u2019ll be where the level of harm that\u2019s perceived to happen to that child is below the threshold for intervention from children's services.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:I\u2019m pretty cynical about assessment, because, you know, I have people come in who are benefit claimants where, when they\u2019ve been assessed, the whole process has been very flawed and I\u2019ve had to fight and fight and fight on their behalf. So\u2014\nSally Jenkins:Assessment processes within social\u2014\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:But if you're struggling now with those assessments\u2014\nSally Jenkins:Assessment processes within social services are as laid out in the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. So, we have within what we carry out, I suppose, that kind of initial look, that look at the information, what else do we know about that family\u2014\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:And are they qualified people that are doing this?\nSally Jenkins:Yes, absolutely.\nHuw David:And, in fact, in lots of places in Wales now, it\u2019s a multi-agency assessment. So, it\u2019s a joint assessment carried out with police professionals and health professionals.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:So, what proportion currently would you not be taking any action on, if a report came in of some domestic abuse where a child had perhaps been smacked?\nSally Jenkins:If something came in to us where a child had been smacked and there was something clearly there, we would look at it. We would clearly look at it and we would take some sort of action.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Even now, before the legislation?\nSally Jenkins:Yes.\nLynne Neagle AM:Can you ask a final question? And I'm going to have to appeal for brief answers, because we've got a lot of ground to cover.\nHuw David:Just very quickly, there may be no action from social services, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t offer support. So, the expectation is that support is offered in those circumstances from family support services, for example\u2014\nSally Jenkins:Or prevention.\nHuw David:\u2014or prevention services. So, we would not say, if we were aware, for example, that there was domestic abuse at a home, \u2018There\u2019s no role for children\u2019s social services\u2019, because there may be an assessment that that child may not be at immediate risk of harm, but we would obviously recognise that there are causes for concern there and we would offer that support. So, just to be clear about that. And that\u2019s a process that happens in every social services department in the UK, and it\u2019s happened for a very long time, and, in fact, it\u2019s reflective of the legislation that you have laid down as Assembly Members.\nLynne Neagle AM:And are those services there, Huw? Because I\u2019m very acutely aware of the pressure on local government. Are the services there? Is there sufficient resource in things like Families First? Because what I\u2019m hearing on the ground is that eligibility is changing for even those preventative services.\nHuw David:There\u2019s not enough of those services, and, obviously\u2014you may have heard me saying this before\u2014I think we need to invest more in those services, and I hope you invest more in the services, because, obviously, prevention is better than cure. And those pressures that Sally talked about earlier are pressures that are not going away; they\u2019re only increasing by the day, actually, and I would want us to be able to offer those services now. Because that example of a child that perhaps is in a home where there is domestic abuse\u2014we\u2019ll probably have another referral off them in a couple of months\u2019 time, and that could escalate. And what I\u2019d rather do is provide support to that family and try and stop that family breaking down so that, in six months, we're not going back and saying that we've got to take this child into care because the domestic abuse has worsened and that child is at risk. But those services need additional investment.\nSally Jenkins:I appreciate that time is of the essence, but, just really quickly in relation to that, it\u2019s not just social services. So, for example, there are developments like Encompass, which is a piece of work that is being rolled out across Gwent and across other areas, which is where the police automatically notify the school overnight of an incident, not expecting the school to do anything per se, but to be aware, to be able to offer care for that child.\nAlastair Birch:Can I add to that? Operation Encompass I know in Gwent has been operational, and we started it in Pembrokeshire 18 months ago. We as a local authority\u2014and it\u2019ll be education that will contact the school around the domestic incident happening, and the school as part of that protocol will provide a level of universal service support for that child when they come in, before 9 o\u2019clock, so that professionals are aware of the needs of the welfare of that child at that point. So, you know, schools play a key role in the universal service of this and we work very closely with our social care colleagues on that.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Janet, your last question, please.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:The Bill's explanatory memorandum refers to an estimate of 274 offences annually where lawful chastisement was used as a defence or considered. It says there is also potential to create extra demand on out-of-hours social services teams due to the time that the offences were reported, and in order to support safeguarding measures. Have you assessed how this Bill will impact on emergency and out-of-hours local authority services?\nSally Jenkins:We have considered that, and again I think that's something that we would very much want to look at as part of implementation. We have out-of-hours provision, we have emergency duty teams already across Wales that operate 24/7. There's no doubt that they exist and they work very closely with our police colleagues.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Are they overstretched at the moment?\nSally Jenkins:I think in the same way as all of social services is. If we were offered additional resource, we are going to take that. But are they working in a way that protects children day in, day out, and vulnerable adults? Yes, they are, and they will continue to do so.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you very much. We've got some specific questions now on the impact on education from Jayne Bryant.\nJayne Bryant AM:Thank you, Chair. Good morning. Alastair, you've already mentioned about awareness raising and training, which will be key with educational professionals. How confident are you that teachers and others working in those educational settings will be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill, if enacted?\nAlastair Birch:Training requirements for all professionals in education settings are clear. The universal tier 1 training is there, and all local authorities in Wales will implement that. In that level of general safeguarding awareness and training, the infinite emphasis is on the duty to report. That will remain the same. The thresholds for social care, that's their responsibility. That duty to report will always be there. It says in 'Keeping learners safe', which is the bible in terms of education professionals, that there's a responsibility on the professional to make that referral and for that universal service. So, the more specialist safeguarding leads within the schools, who have become highly skilled professionals in terms of understanding what might be significant harm\u2014because that's what we're talking about\u2014they understand the legalities when a referral needs to be made. There's always the collation of safeguarding information, where there might be just general concerns about neglect and other areas, which combined would create a picture that there might be significant neglect or significant harm to the child, and then that referral would be made to the child care assessment team or the police. So, that awareness\u2014it needs to be clear for educational professionals that that duty to report is always there. If they believe that that significant harm has happened then that report then goes to the child care assessment team. They will make the judgment on the threshold because they are the professionals. They have the multi-agency awareness of how that meets the threshold. But in terms of education, it'll be that awareness, making sure that there's clarity. If there's anything that professionals need to be trained additionally on, it'll need to go into 'Keeping learners safe', which at the moment is being rewritten. So, there would have to be some new possible information there relating to this. But as long as there's clarity, and once that implementation phase and the discussion has happened, as long as it's clear for professionals that the duty is always there and they feel a significant harm, then that report will always be there and will always need to be made. It's making sure\u2014and I'll echo what my colleague said, Huw\u2014that the services are key for families. Schools are absolutely fundamental in that support for the families. They have those relationships with the families. I know there was discussion around professional trust. On a daily basis, professionals are working on that trust with parents, because they are the ones that can engage with those families. The family support officers that are working on the ground with highly complex families, with multiple leads and supporting the children\u2014they are fundamental, and investment in that level of support would also help our colleagues as well. So, anything that's preventative. That is already happening in schools and is effective, and is shown to be effective, and has an evidence base\u2014we'd always support that that would continue to be invested in. So, that's really my answer.\nJayne Bryant AM:Okay. And you were saying about how important trust is as well, but do you think that there's a risk that those in education settings will have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which some have said could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust?\nAlastair Birch:I don't think it's a matter of mistrust\u2014it's a matter of, you know, if a professional believes, based on the evidence that they have, because they're working with that child every day, that there is significant harm to that child, they are under a duty to report that to social care. So, part of the work is with families, and most of the referrals we make are with parental consent. That consent is a key element of this, and conversation with our social care colleagues is usually, 'You need to speak to the parents again and have a conversation with them.' Some of the NFAs\u2014the ones that don't get referred at threshold\u2014it will come back to school for, possibly, some support from the family or a team around the family or some other aspect. So, I don't think\u2014. The trust in the professionals\u2014it's actually more important that we are seen to be upholding our duties under the all-Wales safeguarding procedures. That's what engenders trust in a professional workforce.\nJayne Bryant AM:Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you very much. We're going to move on now to some questions about the importance of awareness raising from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Good morning. In looking at your written evidence, you say that we must make it very clear to parents, guardians and the public that this legislation is not trying to criminalise parents, and that is clearly very important for you. How do you think we should do that and who should be doing that work?\nSally Jenkins:I think that's really broad. Obviously, colleagues in education, colleagues in social care, colleagues in preventative services, but also Welsh Government and the National Assembly, in terms of those drivers in relation to that awareness raising are really, really key. If you look at some of the other campaigns that have been run, notably in relation to violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence, and echoing some of those building campaigns that have been done to raise awareness\u2014I think those would be really good models to begin to consider in terms of how this is taken forward with awareness. We also know that there are a number of routes that we can go through in terms of raising awareness. We have existing preventative services, we have all our universal services, we have the regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards. So, there are a number of avenues that we could then explore. In terms of not wishing to criminalise, I think if we look at the numbers, they are very, very small. And I think one of the things we need to hold on to in this is a sense of proportion about what is or isn't likely to happen once or if this Bill ever gets to the point of Royal Assent\u2014they are small numbers who currently use this defence. It is about that wider issue of awareness raising, and using all of those avenues will help us to do that in the broadest sense.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Do you, therefore, believe that this needs to be on the face of the Bill? That is, you don't say this in your evidence. I'd like to know your opinion on that. Scotland is going to be making it a duty for Scottish Ministers to raise awareness of the impact of the Bill. So far, the Welsh Government says that we don't need to do that in Wales. Wouldn't it make it clearer for you if it was a clear duty on the face of the Bill, for example as it was with the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013? There was a duty in that Act for Ministers to promote transplantation. Surely, that awareness raising aspect would be clearer for everyone if it was on the face of the Bill. Do you have an opinion on that?\nHuw David:Well, Welsh Government have given that commitment, and I know the Welsh Government honour every commitment that they make\u2014[Laughter.]\nSian Gwenllian AM:That's why I'm asking.\nHuw David:I don't know whether that is necessary\u2014I'm not a legislator. I think that there's obviously an inherent interest in Welsh Government raising awareness, because we have to raise awareness effectively for this to be successful, otherwise we will have parents who feel that they're being criminalised, and that's the last thing we want. I think it's worthy of consideration, but, as I say, I'm not a legislator or a lawyer, so I don't know what implications that will have long term. But to be fair to Welsh Government, I think that commitment is one that I'm sure will be honoured, because Welsh Government will want to make a success of this Bill if it does receive Royal Assent.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. But is it clear who would pay for all of that?\nHuw David:I've suddenly changed my mind\u2014[Laughter.] I think it should be a duty on Welsh Government Ministers\u2014absolutely. I don't need to check with lawyers or legislators. There we go. And that's the WLGA position; I don't need to ask the other 21 leaders on that either. [Laughter.]\nSian Gwenllian AM:Wouldn't it make it clearer if there was a clear duty on the face of the Bill that awareness raising had to happen? It would be clearer, then, for local authorities and people in the front-line services what needs to happen.\nSally Jenkins:I'm going to echo Huw. [Laughter.]\nSian Gwenllian AM:I thought you might. Okay, fine.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. We're moving on now, then, to the contentious issue of resources and we've got some questions from Hefin.\nHefin David AM:Sally Jenkins, you said that the purpose of the Bill is to bring clarity and to remove what is a little-used defence. Isn't this an expensive way of doing that?\nSally Jenkins:I don't think so, no. I think that our children deserve the best legislation.\nHefin David AM:But introducing this legislation diverts finances from other areas of children's services\u2014or doesn't?\nSally Jenkins:Well, I would say, no, I don't think it will divert resources from children's services. Firstly, going back to the comment made, I think, proportionally, this is a very small number of cases. It's a very small number of existing cases that go through in terms of prosecution, or consideration for prosecution. We know that it's likely, from some of the work that we've already done, that it's not opening floodgates for a sudden sea of referrals to children's services\u2014that's not the way this is going to be, because the numbers are not out there because of the changes that have already happened in Welsh family life and Welsh society. So, I think as part of the implementation phase, we need to have a really clear understanding of the trajectory of those costs and what's likely to happen over the first six months, 12 months in terms of people's awareness and understanding and what is referred and how that's worked. But in terms of a huge number, no, I don't anticipate it being that.\nHefin David AM:But the costs wouldn't just be directed to the number of referrals and the number of cases raised, it's the cost around that, with training of staff, awareness\u2014all those extra additional costs that always come with legislation. Is it too much? Is it\u2014?\nSally Jenkins:No. And I agree with that\u2014that there clearly are\u2014but if you think, many of those things will be aligned with work we are already doing, but it brings a clarity to that work. So, our teachers, our social workers, our health workers, our police officers already get substantial training around child protection, around safeguarding, around adverse childhood experiences and around a trauma-informed approach to children. What this does is it layers a clarity on that. But rather than having a part of that training, which has to deal with this as an aspect\u2014that is no longer there; it is a clear message for all professions.\nHefin David AM:I fully appreciate that, and in the briefing note you've given us, you've outlined the pressures on social services. So, do you think this is another way of getting money into social services?\nSally Jenkins:If this was a way of getting money into\u2014. I can think of better ways, but I don't think this is it. No, I mean, I absolutely do not think that. I think this is a clear commitment to the rights of children in Wales; this is not about levering additional resources into children's services. Oh that it was so simple.\nHefin David AM:Okay. And, do you think those costs are quantifiable?\nSally Jenkins:I think we are currently looking at work and are doing work across my own local authority and across two others to look at breaking down those costs, not just for local authority, but also for health, for police and for Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru. So, there is work currently taking place to try to quantify those costs.\nHefin David AM:Okay. I think there was a bit about local authorities that Si\u00e2n\u2014\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian has got a question on resources.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes, just to carry on from that, in a way. The explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill talks about the unknown costs for different agencies. You mentioned there that you're doing work around trying to identify some of those costs, but wouldn't it be useful if the explanatory memorandum did explain more about any unknown or unidentified costs, partly in order to calm some of those fears around that? Giving a title 'unidentified costs'\u2014is that good enough?\nSally Jenkins:I think, clearly, that is a challenge, and that is work that we are participating in and are committed to completing with Welsh Government, to look at what those costs are.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And then they can be added into this.\nHuw David:I think this is where it would be helpful in the committee's deliberations and where our concern would be, because the reality is we're not going to know what the costs are until it's actually implemented, because we haven't implemented this before. And, therefore, I think there needs to be a commitment that, whatever the costs are, those costs are met because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales. And whilst we don't see it as levering in additional resources, we don't think it should be at the expense of current service provision to vulnerable families in Wales, and therefore it's important that it is properly and fully resourced.\nSian Gwenllian AM:What I would argue on that is that you have to try and forecast. You say it's difficult to forecast how much this is going to cost, but we have to try and forecast that, and part of the argument for trying to have projections is to show that, perhaps, it's not going to cost that much, and that would add to the argument that, 'Okay, this is going to be fine to do and it's not going to put too much pressure on us'. Or we need to know that this is going to cost a lot to do it effectively, and therefore you have to make your argument, then, 'Well, we can't afford that, the money has to come from somewhere else.' We have to get the costs, surely.\nHuw David:Yes, and we will work very closely with Welsh Government to try and establish those costs as quickly as possible. There will be some costs that we will be able to identify. So, for example, a campaign, an awareness-raising campaign, the marketing, if you like, but some of the other costs will be more difficult to establish in terms of the resource implications for front-line workers. I expressed a view that we need to see some additional investment in some of those programmes that are not targeted directly at families that would be impacted by this but support all families across Wales that have different needs, and some of that provision is universal. Obviously, my view is the more we put into that, the better. So, there's no limit to that, but I suspect Welsh Government will take a very different view to that. But I think that is something where we need to see a commitment to some additional resources. But I don't put an upper limit on that, because I don't think there's an authority in Wales, and I don't think there's a charity, a police service or a health board in Wales that doesn't think that we need to do more of that and could offer more of that if the resources were available.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you all for attending and for answering all of our questions? It's been a really useful and informative discussion. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for coming.\nHuw David:And thank you for your questions and engagement. We welcome the opportunity.\nAlastair Birch:Thank you very much.\nSally Jenkins:Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, item 3 is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Housing and Local Government\u2014additional information for our inquiry into school funding. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services on in-patient child and adolescent mental health services provision, and I would like to briefly return to that when we go into private. Are Members happy to note those?\u00a0Thank you. Item 4, then: can I propose a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n",
        "summary": "This was a Children, Young People and Education Committee, and it was the sixth scrutiny session on the Children Bill, specifically on Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Punishment. To start this meeting, Alastair Birch shared opinion on why people think the current law was inefficient and unclear, and then Sally Jenkins listed some evidence that physical punishment was actually harmful. Then they had some discussions on how to balance the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, and the importance of simplicity in the Bill. This discussion led to a further discussion on the implementation phase for that nuancing, and its impact on other services. After sharing all of these positive feedbacks in terms of the Bill and its intention, they had some discussions on unintended consequences for this Bill. Then some specific questions on implementation for social services, and its impact on education were proposed and answered. Finally, they had some discussions on the importance of awareness raising.",

And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation .

Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . {vocalsound} Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:Ta-da .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nProject Manager:Over to you .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:Well .\nProject Manager:Ooh , two .\nUser Interface:Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough .\nProject Manager:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:This is the one that I made .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter {disfmarker} takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television {gap} . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um as for what it's actually made of {disfmarker} well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right {vocalsound} in the different menus .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? {vocalsound} Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just {disfmarker} if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Also with on off switch and infrared {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . So like uh {disfmarker} well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one {disfmarker} or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the {disfmarker} uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . {vocalsound} Uh material {disfmarker} yeah , that's what I have to say about material . Can I scroll down on there and see what else {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Well colour , I think {disfmarker} I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . {vocalsound} So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm {disfmarker} yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them .\nIndustrial Designer:Um well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case {disfmarker} oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a {disfmarker} quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um {vocalsound} the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material . Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really .\nUser Interface:I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped .\nIndustrial Designer:A banana .\nUser Interface:This one has n banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like {disfmarker} yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Hold them , you see , you know . Curvature , is it to your liking ?\nProject Manager:Oh I see , the on-off's in the back .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all .\nProject Manager:And then you can use your thumb . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And it was partly we thought the design looked better ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . {gap}\nProject Manager:I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the you know {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Breaking ,\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:oh right . {vocalsound} Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid .\nMarketing:I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , {gap} we really like we really like that design ,\nMarketing:It's really kind of a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , {vocalsound} but better .\nMarketing:Yeah . But it's also like texting ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing:you don't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:I mean it {disfmarker} that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ?\nIndustrial Designer:And it's a very simple design ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It's texting .\nIndustrial Designer:there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make .\nMarketing:It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite {disfmarker} it looks quite different .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:You know , I I d I have several {disfmarker} four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:you know , this is really identifiable .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but we do definitely think that it's a viable option .\nProject Manager:Okay . The next item is evaluation .\nMarketing:No , okay .\nProject Manager:Uh if that's {disfmarker} if you're finished .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh yeah , we're finished .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:shall I take your uh power ?\nProject Manager:Oh sorry .\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Try again .\nMarketing:Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board . Okay . So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials .\nMarketing:like they overlap . Mm , yeah , price .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:We'll put price up at the top .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Not that we actually know anything about it ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but we can we can pretend .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well we will soon , unfortunately .\nMarketing:Um Okay , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Come on .\nMarketing:Did you say {gap} ?\nProject Manager:No , {gap} .\nMarketing:Uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?\nUser Interface:It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and {disfmarker} which\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I'd call these quite uh minimalist ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , a plain , simple , clean design .\nUser Interface:simple and plain , but I mean I do see what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so in that respect it is quite fancy .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I {disfmarker} yeah , so in that respect {disfmarker} I think we'll go with that respect .\nUser Interface:I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well we have got s trendy further down ,\nProject Manager:Elegant .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Elegant .\nMarketing:Elegant .\nIndustrial Designer:Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant .\nMarketing:Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} like stylish or aesthetic .\nIndustrial Designer:Stylish , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Fancy .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} N that {disfmarker} um\nUser Interface:Did you just break the pen ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:yeah uh {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level .\nUser Interface:Well d we'll just call it fancy then .\nMarketing:Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps {disfmarker} and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow in terms of {disfmarker} I think that's a really superior {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think we n we need to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:they're both {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:that isn't {disfmarker} that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff ,\nMarketing:As a banana .\nUser Interface:so .\nMarketing:I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And of the two I really like I m I like the banana ,\nProject Manager:The chunk .\nMarketing:but I I do like the chunk .\nUser Interface:So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it .\nMarketing:No ,\nUser Interface:Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two .\nMarketing:but I mean in terms {disfmarker} we have to evaluate one of them . Unless {disfmarker} do you guys wanna evaluate both ?\nProject Manager:I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , I'd {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's more true than false , about a two .\nMarketing:Okay . So we say true . {vocalsound} technologically innovative .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .\nMarketing:So we'll say {disfmarker} we'll say uh false . Easy to use .\nIndustrial Designer:Very .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} One ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:is that inappropriate ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Oh , pardon me . Um\nProject Manager:Trendy .\nUser Interface:Oh yes .\nMarketing:trendy , s {vocalsound} and I say specifically spongy fruity .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , so two ? Um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Excess buttons .\nMarketing:are there excess buttons ?\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} That is false .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's false . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um {vocalsound} good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons .\nProject Manager:Better , more intuitive buttons , yes .\nMarketing:True . Ugly .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:People don't respond well to ugly . Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ?\nUser Interface:Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think .\nMarketing:like oh ,\nProject Manager:I like it .\nMarketing:yeah . Yeah , I do too .\nUser Interface:It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object .\nMarketing:Oh yeah . And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? With the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ?\nMarketing:Yeah , with the energy .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:If it's {disfmarker} it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:It is going to be kinetic ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . Yeah , Uh so yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that ,\nMarketing:Well {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but yeah .\nMarketing:you're still in the Play-Doh stage .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there .\nProject Manager:Yes , the instinct says true .\nMarketing:Okay . So true one or should I go to two or three ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'd put it at one I think , but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I would say maybe a two ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:'cause we still {disfmarker} we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , true ,\nUser Interface:I mean it's not just like {disfmarker} I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get .\nIndustrial Designer:it might be the {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , true . True .\nUser Interface:whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all {disfmarker} they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's a good point .\nUser Interface:{gap} uh we need somebody to develop that .\nMarketing:Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna {disfmarker} instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:'cause I have to do an average . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing:And then um excess buttons .\nUser Interface:Just putting no excess buttons .\nMarketing:Exactly . Wow we're doing really well . Yeah , be you know ,\nUser Interface:As for {disfmarker}\nMarketing:so it doesn't ruin the polarity .\nUser Interface:see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Or L_C_D_ . Yeah . Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these {disfmarker} um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here {disfmarker} if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those .\nProject Manager:I think we're good .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay . We're a little over halfway through the meeting\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and the next big thing is the finance . Okay .\nMarketing:Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:and I'll uh figure out the average here .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Thank you for everyone's help with that .\nProject Manager:Right . And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . Okay .\nUser Interface:Well , just kinetic then , {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um what's a hand dynamo ?\nIndustrial Designer:That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's the wind-up .\nProject Manager:Oh\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um {disfmarker} and how many of those will we need per {disfmarker} we only need one .\nIndustrial Designer:Just one .\nProject Manager:Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple {disfmarker} Just checking that . Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest .\nProject Manager:Okay , and we only need one of those .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it {gap} single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that that one is single curve ,\nProject Manager:that's uh uh one .\nIndustrial Designer:isn't it ? Um do we have\nProject Manager:And that's\nUser Interface:What does double curved mean , I don't understand .\nIndustrial Designer:I I think you {disfmarker} it means you reverse the curve .\nProject Manager:uh that's the the one that goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them ,\nUser Interface:Oh no , we don't need that . No .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:you can do a banana in single curve ,\nProject Manager:No ,\nUser Interface:Single-curved , I'd say .\nProject Manager:single curve .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour .\nUser Interface:I\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I just wanna say plastic .\nProject Manager:We had the special colour . And did we say plastic ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself ,\nMarketing:One , two , three , four , five , six .\nIndustrial Designer:but it depends on the cost , I guess .\nProject Manager:Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button {disfmarker} push button interface . That's what we're using ,\nUser Interface:It's just button .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Do we need to say how many buttons , or\nProject Manager:Whoops , don't want that , not yet . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:or d is it just one ?\nProject Manager:No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:And the buttons {disfmarker} Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh they'll be rubber , yep .\nProject Manager:So we need one of them . And are they any special form ?\nUser Interface:Well yeah , like the compass point one .\nIndustrial Designer:Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic .\nProject Manager:'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons ,\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:because we haven't got a double curved case .\nUser Interface:Yeah , they could be plastic .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Um let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement .\nIndustrial Designer:It's just one , isn't it ?\nProject Manager:Uh we only need one of them . Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .\nIndustrial Designer:What , we're in .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We're in . {vocalsound} That's us .\nIndustrial Designer:More profit .\nUser Interface:Great .\nProject Manager:Okay , I'm going to save this into our {vocalsound} desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit .\nIndustrial Designer:Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . There we are . That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Right . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . Yeah , leadership , teamwork ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Sure . Yes .\nProject Manager:means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And Play-Doh .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Um did we find any new ideas ?\nMarketing:I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I {disfmarker} that really opened my eyes .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} Spongy .\nMarketing:I I only speak for myself though .\nUser Interface:And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:so . Good work as a design team ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , I think we're a good team actually .\nUser Interface:because we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not sure all the wires are really great though .\nProject Manager:So we actually worked well as a group .\nIndustrial Designer:I thought so .\nProject Manager:Right . Are the costs within the budget ? Yes .\nUser Interface:Oh yes .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Is the project evaluated ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:I can give you a number ,\nIndustrial Designer:hang on , Oh we haven't heard . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:um it's uh {disfmarker} the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine {disfmarker} we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology ,\nMarketing:To maintain old technology , exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works ,\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget .\nUser Interface:so . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So we do count as I think excellent or one .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:And we've therefore {disfmarker} we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:We done good , and we're finished in time .\nUser Interface:Bring on the ice sculptures .\nMarketing:Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:And then we get the product launch party .\nMarketing:So we might have to wait .\nIndustrial Designer:Product launch party ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's what I said , ice sculptures .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um I {disfmarker} one thing I want to do is {disfmarker} oh , I think the meeting's done .\nProject Manager:I believe that is the end of our meeting . Thank you , Melissa . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved . The right files . Final meeting market\n",
        "summary": "After Project Manager first went over the previous meeting and summarized the meeting agenda, Inudstrial Designer started the prototype presentation of the remote control.  The remote control should be curved with scroll and push buttons, made by smooth plastic or spongy rubber. Marketing presented the evaluation criteria of the remote control in terms of the user requirements and the trends. The remote control shall be fancy because it was heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality. Finally, they confirmed the components they planned to use under the restrict of finance.",

This is what , uh ,\nGrad C:This is a meeting for me .\nGrad B:um , Eva , Bhaskara , and I did .\nGrad D:Did you add more stuff to it ? {pause} later ?\nGrad B:Um . Why ?\nGrad D:Um . I don't know . There were , like , the {disfmarker} you know , @ @ and all that stuff . But . I thought you {disfmarker} you said you were adding stuff\nGrad B:Uh , no .\nGrad D:but {pause} I don't know .\nGrad B:This is {disfmarker} Um , Ha ! Very nice . Um , so we thought that , {vocalsound} We can write up uh , an element , and {disfmarker} for each of the situation nodes that we observed in the Bayes - net ? So . What 's the situation like at the entity that is mentioned ? if we know anything about it ? Is it under construction ? Or is it on fire or something {pause} happening to it ? Or is it stable ? and so forth , going all the way um , f through Parking , Location , Hotel , Car , Restroom , @ @ {comment} Riots , Fairs , Strikes , or Disasters .\nGrad C:So is {disfmarker} This is {disfmarker} A situation are {disfmarker} is all the things which can be happening right now ? Or , what is the situation type ?\nGrad B:That 's basically {pause} just specifying the {disfmarker} the input for the {disfmarker} w what 's\nGrad C:Oh , I see y Why are you specifying it in XML ?\nGrad B:Um . Just because it forces us to be specific about the values {pause} here ?\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad B:And , also , I mean , this is a {disfmarker} what the input is going to be . Right ? So , we will , uh {disfmarker} This is a schema . This is {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Well , yeah . I just don't know if this is th l what the {disfmarker} Does {disfmarker} This is what Java Bayes takes ? as a Bayes - net spec ?\nGrad B:No , because I mean if we {disfmarker} I mean we 're sure gonna interface to {disfmarker} We 're gonna get an XML document from somewhere . Right ? And that XML document will say \" We are able to {disfmarker} We were able to observe that w the element , um , @ @ {comment} of the Location that the car is near . \" So that 's gonna be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {comment} Um .\nGrad C:So this is the situational context , everything in it . Is that what Situation is short for , shi situational context ?\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad B:So this is just , again , a an XML schemata which defines a set of possible , uh , permissible XML structures , which we view as input into the Bayes - net . Right ?\nGrad C:And then we can r {pause} uh possibly run one of them uh transformations ? That put it into the format that the Bayes n or Java Bayes or whatever wants ?\nGrad B:Yea - Are you talking {disfmarker} are you talking about the {disfmarker} the structure ?\nGrad C:Well it {disfmarker}\nGrad B:I mean when you observe a node .\nGrad C:When you {disfmarker} when you say {pause} the input to the {pause} v Java Bayes , {comment} it takes a certain format ,\nGrad B:Um - hmm .\nGrad C:right ? Which I don't think is this . Although I don't know .\nGrad B:No , it 's certainly not this . Nuh .\nGrad C:So you could just {disfmarker} Couldn't you just run a {disfmarker}\nGrad B:XSL . {comment} Yeah .\nGrad C:Yeah . To convert it into the Java Bayes for format ?\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad B:That 's {disfmarker} That 's no problem , but I even think that , um {disfmarker} I mean , once {disfmarker} Once you have this sort of as {disfmarker} running as a module {disfmarker} Right ? What you want is {disfmarker} You wanna say , \" OK , give me the posterior probabilities of the Go - there {pause} node , when this is happening . \" Right ? When the person said this , the car is there , it 's raining , and this is happening . And with this you can specify the {disfmarker} what 's happening in the situation , and what 's happening with the user . So we get {disfmarker} After we are done , through the Situation we get the User Vector . So , this is a {disfmarker}\nGrad C:So this is just a specification of all the possible inputs ?\nGrad B:Yep . And , all the possible outputs , too . So , we have , um , for example , the , uh , Go - there decision node\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad B:which has two elements , going - there and its posterior probability , and not - going - there and its posterior probability , because the output is always gonna be all the decision nodes and all the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} a all the posterior probabilities for all the values .\nGrad C:And then we would just look at the , eh , Struct that we wanna look at in terms of if {disfmarker} if we 're only asking about one of the {disfmarker} So like , if I 'm just interested in the going - there node , I would just pull that information out of the Struct that gets return that would {disfmarker} that Java Bayes would output ?\nGrad B:Um , pretty much , yes , but I think it 's a little bit more complex . As , if I understand it correctly , it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes . So , when we input something , we always get the , uh , posterior probabilities for all of these . Right ?\nGrad C:OK .\nGrad B:So there is no way of telling it t not to tell us about the EVA {pause} values .\nGrad C:Yeah , wait I agree , that 's {disfmarker} yeah , use {disfmarker} oh , uh {pause} Yeah , OK .\nGrad B:So {disfmarker} so we get this whole list of {disfmarker} of , um , things , and the question is what to do with it , what to hand on , how to interpret it , in a sense . So y you said if you {disfmarker} \" I 'm only interested in whether he wants to go there or not \" , then I just look at that node , look which one {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Look at that Struct in the output ,\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad C:right ?\nGrad B:Look at that Struct in the {disfmarker} the output , even though I wouldn't call it a \" Struct \" . But .\nGrad C:Well i well , it 's an XML Structure that 's being res returned ,\nGrad B:Oh . Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:right ?\nGrad B:So every part of a structure is a \" Struct \" . Yeah .\nGrad C:Yeah , I just uh {disfmarker} I just was {disfmarker} abbreviated it to Struct in my head , and started going with that .\nGrad B:That element or object , I would say .\nGrad C:Not a C Struct . That 's not what I was trying to k\nGrad B:Yeah .\nGrad C:though yeah .\nGrad B:OK . And , um , the reason is {disfmarker} why I think it 's a little bit more complex or why {disfmarker} why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is {disfmarker} Um . So . The , uh {disfmarker} Let 's look at an example .\nGrad C:Well , w wouldn't we just take the structure that 's outputted and then run another transformation on it , that would just dump the one that we wanted out ?\nGrad B:Yeah . w We 'd need to prune . Right ? Throw things away .\nGrad C:Well , actually , you don't even need to do that with XML .\nGrad B:No\nGrad C:D Can't you just look at one specific {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Yeah , exactly . The {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Xerxes allows you to say , u \" Just give me the value of that , and that , and that . \" But , we don't really know what we 're interested in {pause} before we look at the complete {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} at the overall result . So the person said , um , \" Where is X ? \" and so , we want to know , um , is {disfmarker} Does he want info ? o on this ? or know the location ? Or does he want to go there ? Let 's assume this is our {disfmarker} our question .\nGrad C:Sure .\nGrad B:Nuh ? So . Um . Do this in Perl . So we get {disfmarker} OK . Let 's assume this is the output . So . We should con be able to conclude from that that {disfmarker} I mean . It 's always gonna give us a value of how likely we think i it is that he wants to go there and doesn't want to go there , or how likely it is that he wants to get information . But , maybe w we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate . So , does he wanna know where it is ? or does he wanna go there ?\nGrad C:He wants to know where it is .\nGrad B:Right . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I tend to agree . And if it 's {disfmarker} If {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Well now , y I mean , you could {disfmarker}\nGrad B:And i if there 's sort of a clear winner here , and , um {disfmarker} and this is pretty , uh {disfmarker} indifferent , then we {disfmarker} then we might conclude that he actually wants to just know where , uh t uh , he does want to go there .\nGrad C:Uh , out of curiosity , is there a reason why we wouldn't combine these three nodes ? into one smaller subnet ? that would just basically be {pause} the question for {disfmarker} We have \" where is X ? \" is the question , right ? That would just be Info - on or Location ? Based upon {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Or Go - there . A lot of people ask that , if they actually just wanna go there . People come up to you on campus and say , \" Where 's the library ? \" You 're gonna say {disfmarker} y you 're gonna say , g \" Go down that way . \" You 're not gonna say \" It 's {disfmarker} It 's five hundred yards away from you \" or \" It 's north of you \" , or {disfmarker} \" it 's located {disfmarker} \"\nGrad C:Well , I mean {disfmarker} But the {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} So you just have three decisions for the final node , that would link thes these three nodes in the net together .\nGrad B:Um . I don't know whether I understand what you mean . But . Again , in this {disfmarker} Given this input , we , also in some situations , may wanna postulate an opinion whether that person wants to go there now the nicest way , use a cab , or so s wants to know it {disfmarker} wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there , because he wants to visit t it or whatever . So , it {disfmarker} n I mean {disfmarker} a All I 'm saying is , whatever our input is , we 're always gonna get the full output . And some {disfmarker} some things will always be sort of too {disfmarker} not significant enough .\nGrad C:Wha Or i or i it 'll be tight . You won't {disfmarker} it 'll be hard to decide .\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad C:But I mean , I guess {disfmarker} I guess the thing is , uh , this is another , smaller , case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty , which makes me think Bayes - net should be the way to solve these things . So if you had {disfmarker} If for every construction ,\nGrad B:Oh !\nGrad C:right ? you could say , \" Well , there {disfmarker} Here 's the Where - Is construction . \" And for the Where - Is construction , we know we need to l look at this node , that merges these three things together\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:as for th to decide the response . And since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with , we could have a finite number of nodes .\nGrad B:OK . Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:Say , if we had to y deal with arbitrary language , it wouldn't make any sense to do that , because there 'd be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:But since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff {disfmarker}\nGrad B:So , basically , the idea is to f to feed the output of that belief - net into another belief - net .\nGrad C:Yeah , so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief - net .\nGrad B:But , why {disfmarker} why {disfmarker} why only those three ? Why not the whol\nGrad C:Well , I mean , d For the Where - Is question . So we 'd have a node for the Where - Is question .\nGrad B:Yeah . But we believe that all the decision nodes are {disfmarker} can be relevant for the Where - Is , and the Where {disfmarker} How - do - I - get - to or the Tell - me - something - about .\nGrad C:You can come in if you want .\nGrad B:Yes , it is allowed .\nGrad C:As long as y you 're not wearing your h your h headphones . Well , I do I {disfmarker} See , I don't know if this is a {pause} good idea or not . I 'm just throwing it out . But uh , it seems like we could have {disfmarker} I mea or uh we could put all of the all of the r information that could also be relevant {pause} into the Where - Is node answer\nGrad B:Mm - hmm . Yep .\nGrad C:node thing stuff . And uh {disfmarker}\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad B:I mean {disfmarker} Let 's not forget we 're gonna get some very strong {pause} input from {pause} these sub dis from these discourse things , right ? So . \" Tell me the location of X . \" Nuh ? Or \" Where is X located at ? \"\nGrad C:We u\nGrad B:Nuh ?\nGrad C:Yeah , I know , but the Bayes - net would be able to {disfmarker} The weights on the {disfmarker} on the nodes in the Bayes - net would be able to do all that ,\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:wouldn't it ? Here 's a k Oh ! Oh , I 'll wait until you 're {pause} plugged in . Oh , don't sit there . Sit here . You know how you don't like that one . It 's OK . That 's the weird one . That 's the one that 's painful . That hurts . It hurts so bad . I 'm h I 'm happy that they 're recording that . That headphone . The headphone {pause} that you have to put on backwards , with the little {disfmarker} little thing {disfmarker} and the little {disfmarker} little foam block on it ? It 's a painful , painful microphone .\nGrad B:I think it 's th called \" the Crown \" .\nGrad C:The crown ?\nGrad D:What ?\nGrad B:Yeah , versus \" the Sony \" .\nGrad A:The Crown ? Is that the actual name ? OK .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm . The manufacturer .\nGrad C:I don't see a manufacturer on it .\nGrad B:You w\nGrad C:Oh , wait , here it is . h This thingy . Yeah , it 's \" The Crown \" . The crown of pain !\nGrad A:Yes .\nGrad B:You 're on - line ?\nGrad C:Are you {disfmarker} are your mike o Is your mike on ?\nGrad A:Indeed .\nGrad C:OK . So you 've been working with these guys ? You know what 's going on ?\nGrad A:Yes , I have . And , I do . Yeah , alright . s So where are we ?\nGrad C:Excellent !\nGrad B:We 're discussing this .\nGrad A:I don't think it can handle French , but anyway .\nGrad B:So . Assume we have something coming in . A person says , \" Where is X ? \" , and we get a certain {disfmarker} We have a Situation vector and a User vector and everything is fine ? An - an and {disfmarker} and our {disfmarker} and our {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Did you just sti Did you just stick the m the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the microphone actually in the tea ?\nGrad A:No .\nGrad B:And , um ,\nGrad A:I 'm not drinking tea . What are you talking about ?\nGrad C:Oh , yeah . Sorry .\nGrad B:let 's just assume our Bayes - net just has three decision nodes for the time being . These three , he wants to know something about it , he wants to know where it is , he wants to go there .\nGrad C:In terms of , these would be wha how we would answer the question Where - Is , right ? We u This is {disfmarker} i That 's what you s it seemed like , explained it to me earlier\nGrad B:Yeah , but , mmm .\nGrad C:w We {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we wanna know how to answer the question \" Where is X ? \"\nGrad B:Yeah . No , I can {disfmarker} I can do the Timing node in here , too , and say \" OK . \"\nGrad C:Well , yeah , but in the s uh , let 's just deal with the s the simple case of we 're not worrying about timing or anything . We just want to know how we should answer \" Where is X ? \"\nGrad B:OK . And , um , OK , and , Go - there has two values , right ? , Go - there and not - Go - there . Let 's assume those are the posterior probabilities of that .\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:Info - on has True or False and Location . So , he wants to know something about it , and he wants to know something {disfmarker} he wants to know Where - it - is ,\nGrad A:Excuse me .\nGrad B:has these values . And , um ,\nGrad C:Oh , I see why we can't do that .\nGrad B:And , um , in this case we would probably all agree that he wants to go there . Our belief - net thinks he wants to go there ,\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad B:right ?\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:In the , uh , whatever , if we have something like this here , and this like that and maybe here also some {disfmarker}\nGrad A:You should probably {comment} make them out of {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad B:something like that ,\nGrad C:Well , it\nGrad B:then we would guess , \" Aha ! He , our belief - net , {comment} has s stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is , than actually wants to go {pause} there . \" Right ?\nGrad C:That it {disfmarker} Doesn't this assume , though , that they 're evenly weighted ?\nGrad D:True .\nGrad C:Like {disfmarker} I guess they are evenly weighted .\nGrad A:The different decision nodes , you mean ?\nGrad C:Yeah , the Go - there , the Info - on , and the Location ?\nGrad A:Well , d yeah , this is making the assumption . Yes .\nGrad C:Like {disfmarker}\nGrad B:What do you mean by \" differently weighted \" ? They don't feed into anything really anymore .\nGrad A:But I mean , why do we {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Or I jus\nGrad A:If we trusted the Go - there node more th much more than we trusted the other ones , then we would conclude , even in this situation , that he wanted to go there .\nGrad C:Le\nGrad A:So , in that sense , we weight them equally right now .\nGrad B:OK . Makes sense . Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nGrad C:So the But I guess the k the question {disfmarker} that I was as er wondering or maybe Robert was proposing to me is {disfmarker} How do we d make the decision on {disfmarker} as to {disfmarker} which one to listen to ?\nGrad A:Yeah , so , the final d decision is the combination of these three . So again , it 's {disfmarker} it 's some kind of , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Bayes - net .\nGrad A:Yeah , sure .\nGrad C:OK so , then , the question i So then my question is t to you then , would be {disfmarker} So is the only r reason we can make all these smaller Bayes - nets , because we know we can only deal with a finite set of constructions ? Cuz oth If we 're just taking arbitrary language in , we couldn't have a node for every possible question , you know ?\nGrad A:A decision node for every possible question , you mean ?\nGrad C:Well , I {disfmarker} like , in the case of {disfmarker} Yeah . In the ca Any piece of language , we wouldn't be able to answer it with this system , b if we just h Cuz we wouldn't have the correct node . Basically , w what you 're s proposing is a n Where - Is node , right ?\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:And {disfmarker} and if we {disfmarker} And if someone {disfmarker} says , you know , uh , something in Mandarin to the system , we 'd - wouldn't know which node to look at to answer that question ,\nGrad A:So is {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad C:right ?\nGrad B:Mmm ?\nGrad C:So , but {disfmarker} but if we have a finite {disfmarker} What ?\nGrad B:I don't see your point . What {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what I am thinking , or what we 're about to propose here is we 're always gonna get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities . And now we need an expert system or belief - net or something that interprets that , that looks at all the values and says , \" The winner is Timing . Now , go there . \" \" Uh , go there , Timing , now . \" Or , \" The winner is Info - on , Function - Off . \" So , he wants to know {pause} something about it , and what it does . Nuh ? Uh , regardless of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the input . Wh - Regardle\nGrad C:Yeah , but But how does the expert {disfmarker} but how does the expert system know {disfmarker} how who which one to declare the winner , if it doesn't know the question it is , and how that question should be answered ?\nGrad B:Based on the k what the question was , so what the discourse , the ontology , the situation and the user model gave us , we came up with these values for these decisions .\nGrad C:Yeah I know . But how do we weight what we get out ? As , which one i Which ones are important ? So my i So , if we were to it with a Bayes - net , we 'd have to have a node {disfmarker} for every question that we knew how to deal with , that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:Does that make sense ? Yay , nay ?\nGrad A:Um , I mean , are you saying that , what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation , or are we just dealing with arbitrary language ?\nGrad C:We {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Is that your point ?\nGrad C:Well , no . I {disfmarker} I guess my question is , Is the reason that we can make a node f or {disfmarker} OK . So , lemme see if I 'm confused . Are we going to make a node for every question ? Does that make sense ? {disfmarker}\nGrad A:For every question ?\nGrad C:Or not .\nGrad A:Like {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Every construction .\nGrad A:Hmm . I don't {disfmarker} Not necessarily , I would think . I mean , it 's not based on constructions , it 's based on things like , uh , there 's gonna be a node for Go - there or not , and there 's gonna be a node for Enter , View , Approach .\nGrad C:Wel W OK . So , someone asked a question .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:How do we decide how to answer it ?\nGrad B:Well , look at {disfmarker} look {disfmarker} Face yourself with this pr question . You get this {disfmarker} You 'll have {disfmarker} y This is what you get . And now you have to make a decision . What do we think ? What does this tell us ? And not knowing what was asked , and what happened , and whether the person was a tourist or a local , because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities . What {disfmarker} what we need is a {disfmarker} just a mechanism that says , \" Aha ! There is {disfmarker} \"\nGrad C:Yeah . I just don't think a \" winner - take - all \" type of thing is the {disfmarker}\nGrad A:I mean , in general , like , we won't just have those three , right ? We 'll have , uh , like , many , many nodes . So we have to , like {disfmarker} So that it 's no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say .\nGrad B:Yep . Because there are interdependencies , right ? The uh {disfmarker} Uh , no . So if {disfmarker} if for example , the Go - there posterior possibility is so high , um , uh , w if it 's {disfmarker} if it has reached {disfmarker} reached a certain height , then all of this becomes irrelevant . So . If {disfmarker} even if {disfmarker} if the function or the history or something is scoring pretty good on the true node , true value {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Wel I don't know about that , cuz that would suggest that {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad B:He wants to go there and know something about it ?\nGrad C:Do they have to be mutual Yeah . Do they have to be mutually exclusive ?\nGrad B:I think to some extent they are . Or maybe they 're not .\nGrad C:Cuz I , uh {disfmarker} The way you describe what they meant , they weren't mutu uh , they didn't seem mutually exclusive to me .\nGrad B:Well , if he doesn't want to go there , even if the Enter posterior proba So .\nGrad C:Wel\nGrad B:Go - there is No . Enter is High , and Info - on is High .\nGrad C:Well , yeah , just out of the other three , though , that you had in the {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Hmm ?\nGrad C:those three nodes . The - d They didn't seem like they were mutually exclusive .\nGrad B:No , there 's {disfmarker} No . But {disfmarker} It 's through the {disfmarker}\nGrad C:So th s so , yeah , but some {disfmarker} So , some things would drop out , and some things would still be important .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:But I guess what 's confusing me is , if we have a Bayes - net to deal w another Bayes - net to deal with this stuff ,\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:you know , uh , is the only reason {disfmarker} OK , so , I guess , if we have a Ba - another Bayes - net to deal with this stuff , the only r reason {pause} we can design it is cuz we know what each question is asking ?\nGrad A:Yeah . I think that 's true .\nGrad C:And then , so , the only reason {disfmarker} way we would know what question he 's asking is based upon {disfmarker} Oh , so if {disfmarker} Let 's say I had a construction parser , and I plug this in , I would know what each construction {disfmarker} the communicative intent of the construction was\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:and so then I would know how to weight the nodes appropriately , in response . So no matter what they said , if I could map it onto a Where - Is construction , I could say , \" ah !\nGrad A:Ge Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:well the the intent , here , was Where - Is \" ,\nGrad A:OK , right .\nGrad C:and I could look at those .\nGrad A:Yeah . Yes , I mean . Sure . You do need to know {disfmarker} I mean , to have that kind of information .\nGrad B:Hmm . Yeah , I 'm also agreeing that {pause} a simple pru {comment} Take the ones where we have a clear winner . Forget about the ones where it 's all sort of middle ground . Prune those out and just hand over the ones where we have a winner . Yeah , because that would be the easiest way . We just compose as an output an XML mes {vocalsound} message that says . \" Go there {pause} now . \" \" Enter historical information . \" And not care whether that 's consistent with anything . Right ? But in this case if we say , \" definitely he doesn't want to go there . He just wants to know where it is . \" or let 's call this {disfmarker} this \" Look - At - H \" He wants to know something about the history of . So he said , \" Tell me something about the history of that . \" Now , the e But for some reason the Endpoint - Approach gets a really high score , {pause} too . We can't expect this to be sort of at O point {comment} three , three , three , O point , three , three , three , O point , three , three , three . Right ? Somebody needs to zap that . You know ? Or know {disfmarker} There needs to be some knowledge that {disfmarker}\nGrad C:We {disfmarker} Yeah , but , the Bayes - net that would merge {disfmarker} I just realized that I had my hand in between my mouth and my micr er , my and my microphone . So then , the Bayes - net that would merge there , that would make the decision between Go - there , Info - on , and Location , would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted , and based upon that node , then you would look at the other stuff .\nGrad B:Yep . Yep .\nGrad C:I mean , it i Does that make sense ?\nGrad B:Yep . It 's sort of one of those , that 's {disfmarker} It 's more like a decision tree , if {disfmarker} if you want . You first look o at the lowball ones ,\nGrad C:Yeah , i\nGrad B:and then {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Yeah , I didn't intend to say that every possible {disfmarker} OK . There was a confusion there , k I didn't intend to say every possible thing should go into the Bayes - net , because some of the things aren't relevant in the Bayes - net for a specific question . Like the Endpoint is not necessarily relevant in the Bayes - net for Where - Is until after you 've decided whether you wanna go there or not .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:Right .\nGrad C:Show us the way , Bhaskara .\nGrad A:I guess the other thing is that um , yeah . I mean , when you 're asked a specific question and you don't even {disfmarker} Like , if you 're asked a Where - Is question , you may not even look {disfmarker} like , ask for the posterior probability of the , uh , EVA node , right ? Cuz , that 's what {disfmarker} I mean , in the Bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node . So , I mean , you may not even bother to compute things you don't need .\nGrad B:Um . Aren't we always computing all ?\nGrad A:No . You can compute , uh , the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes , given some other nodes , but totally ignore some other nodes , also . Basically , things you ignore get marginalized over .\nGrad B:Yeah , but that 's {disfmarker} that 's just shifting the problem . Then you would have to make a decision ,\nGrad A:Yeah . So you have to make {disfmarker}\nGrad B:\" OK , if it 's a Where - Is question , which decision nodes do I query ? \"\nGrad A:Yeah . Yes . But I would think that 's what you want to do .\nGrad B:That 's un\nGrad A:Right ?\nGrad B:Mmm .\nGrad D:Well , eventually , you still have to pick out which ones you look at .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nGrad D:So it 's pretty much the same problem ,\nGrad B:Yeah {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's apples and oranges .\nGrad D:isn't it ?\nGrad B:Nuh ? I mean , maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance , computational time .\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad B:So either you always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes , and then prune the ones you think that are irrelevant ,\nGrad A:Mmm .\nGrad B:or you just make a p @ @ {comment} a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:So basically , you 'd have a decision tree {pause} query , {pause} Go - there . If k if that 's false , query this one . If that 's true , query that one . And just basically do a binary search through the {disfmarker} ?\nGrad A:I don't know if it would necessarily be that , uh , complicated . But , uh {disfmarker} I mean , it w\nGrad C:Well , in the case of Go - there , it would be . In the case {disfmarker} Cuz if you needed an If y If Go - there was true , you 'd wanna know what endpoint was . And if it was false , you 'd wanna d look at either Lo - Income Info - on or History .\nGrad A:Yeah . That 's true , I guess . Yeah , {vocalsound} so , in a way you would have that .\nGrad C:Also , I 'm somewhat boggled by that Hugin software .\nGrad A:OK , why 's that ?\nGrad C:I can't figure out how to get the probabilities into it . Like , I 'd look at {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:It 's somewha It 's boggling me .\nGrad A:OK . Alright . Well , hopefully it 's {pause} fixable .\nGrad C:Ju\nGrad A:It 's {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Oh yeah , yeah . I d I just think I haven't figured out what {disfmarker} the terms in Hugin mean , versus what Java Bayes terms are .\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad B:Um , by the way , are {disfmarker} Do we know whether Jerry and Nancy are coming ?\nGrad A:So we can figure this out .\nGrad B:Or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad A:They should come when they 're done their stuff , basically , whenever that is . So .\nGrad C:What d what do they need to do left ?\nGrad A:Um , I guess , Jerry needs to enter marks , but I don't know if he 's gonna do that now or later . But , uh , if he 's gonna enter marks , it 's gonna take him awhile , I guess , and he won't be here .\nGrad C:And what 's Nancy doing ?\nGrad A:Nancy ? Um , she was sorta finishing up the , uh , calculation of marks and assigning of grades , but I don't know if she should be here . Well {disfmarker} or , she should be free after that , so {disfmarker} assuming she 's coming to this meeting . I don't know if she knows about it .\nGrad C:She 's on the email list , right ?\nGrad A:Is she ? OK .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm . OK . Because basically , what {disfmarker} where we also have decided , prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad B:sometime {pause} this week {pause} again\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad B:and finish up the , uh , values of this . So we have , uh {disfmarker} Believe it or not , we have all the bottom ones here .\nGrad C:Well , I {disfmarker}\nGrad D:You added a bunch of {pause} nodes , for {disfmarker} ?\nGrad B:Yep . We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we have {disfmarker} Actually what we have is this line .\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad B:Right ?\nGrad C:Uh , what do the , uh , structures do ?\nGrad B:Hmm ?\nGrad C:So the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} For instance , this Location node 's got two inputs ,\nGrad A:Four inputs .\nGrad B:Hmm .\nGrad C:that one you {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Four .\nGrad A:Those are {disfmarker} The bottom things are inputs , also .\nGrad C:Oh , I see .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:OK , that was OK . That makes a lot more sense to me now .\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad C:Cuz I thought it was like , that one in Stuart 's book about , you know , the {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Alarm in the dog ?\nGrad C:U Yeah .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:Or the earthquake and the alarm .\nGrad A:Sorry . Yeah , I 'm confusing two .\nGrad C:Yeah , there 's a dog one , too , but that 's in Java Bayes ,\nGrad A:Right .\nGrad C:isn't it ?\nGrad A:Maybe .\nGrad C:But there 's something about bowel problems or something with the dog .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad B:And we have all the top ones , all the ones to which no arrows are pointing . What we 're missing are the {disfmarker} these , where arrows are pointing , where we 're combining top ones . So , we have to come up with values for this , and this , this , this , and so forth . And maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more . And , um . And then it 's just , uh , edges , many of edges . And , um , we won't {comment} meet next Monday . So .\nGrad C:Cuz of Memorial Day ?\nGrad A:We 'll meet next Tuesday , I guess .\nGrad B:Yep . Yeah .\nGrad C:When 's Jerry leaving for {disfmarker} Italia ?\nGrad B:On {disfmarker} on Friday .\nGrad A:Which Friday ?\nGrad B:This {disfmarker} this Friday .\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad D:Oh . This Friday ?\nGrad C:Ugh .\nGrad B:This Friday .\nGrad C:As in , four days ?\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad C:Or , three days ?\nGrad A:Is he {disfmarker} How long is he gone for ?\nGrad B:Two weeks .\nGrad A:Italy , huh ? What 's , uh {disfmarker} what 's there ?\nGrad B:Well , it 's a country . Buildings . People .\nGrad A:Pasta .\nGrad C:But it 's not a conference or anything .\nGrad B:Hmm ?\nGrad C:He 's just visiting .\nGrad A:Right . Just visiting .\nGrad B:Vacation .\nGrad A:It 's a pretty nice place , in my brief , uh , encounter with it .\nGrad B:Do you guys {disfmarker} Oh , yeah . So . Part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when {disfmarker} when he comes back . Um , so {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Oh , I think we should disappoint him .\nGrad B:Yeah ? You {disfmarker} or have a finished construction parser and a working belief - net , and uh {disfmarker}\nGrad C:That wouldn't be disappointing . I think w we should do absolutely no work for the two weeks that he 's gone .\nGrad B:Well , that 's actually what I had planned , personally . I had {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work , and I do nothing . And then , I sort of {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Oh , yeah , that sounds good , too .\nGrad B:sort of bask in {disfmarker} in your glory . But , uh , i do you guys have any vacation plans , because I myself am going to be , um , gone , but this is actually not really important . Just this weekend we 're going camping .\nGrad C:Yeah , I 'm wanna be this {disfmarker} gone this weekend , too .\nGrad B:Ah . But we 're all going to be here on Tuesday again ? Looks like it ?\nGrad D:Yeah .\nGrad B:OK , then . Let 's meet {disfmarker} meet again next Tuesday . And , um , finish up this Bayes - net . And once we have finished it , I guess we can , um {disfmarker} and that 's going to be more just you and me , because Bhaskara is doing probabilistic , recursive , structured , object - oriented , uh ,\nGrad C:Killing machines !\nGrad B:reasoning machines .\nGrad A:Yes .\nGrad B:And , um {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Killing , reasoning . What 's the difference ?\nGrad D:Wait . So you 're saying , next Tuesday , is it the whole group meeting , or just us three working on it , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad B:Uh . The whole group . And we present our results , our final ,\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad B:definite {disfmarker}\nGrad D:So , when you were saying we {pause} need to do a re - run of , like {disfmarker}\nGrad A:h What ?\nGrad D:What {disfmarker} Like , just working out the rest of the {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Yeah . We should do this th the upcoming days .\nGrad D:This week ?\nGrad B:So , this week , yeah .\nGrad C:When you say , \" the whole group \" , you mean {pause} the four of us , and Keith ?\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad B:And , Ami might .\nGrad C:Ami might be here , and it 's possible that Nancy 'll be here ?\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad C:So , yeah .\nGrad B:Because , th you know , once we have the belief - net done {disfmarker}\nGrad C:You 're just gonna have to explain it to me , then , on Tuesday , how it 's all gonna work out . You know .\nGrad B:We will . OK . Because then , once we have it sort of up and running , then we can start you know , defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it , and then hook it up to some fake construction parser and {disfmarker}\nGrad C:That you will have in about nine months or so .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nGrad B:And , um ,\nGrad C:The first bad version 'll be done in nine months .\nGrad B:Yeah , I can worry about the ontology interface and you can {disfmarker} Keith can worry about the discourse . I mean , this is pretty {disfmarker} Um , I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I hope everybody uh knows that these are just going to be uh dummy values , right ?\nGrad A:Which {disfmarker}\nGrad B:where the {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Which ones ?\nGrad B:S so {disfmarker} so if the endpoint {disfmarker} if the Go - there is Yes and No , then Go - there - discourse will just be fifty - fifty . Right ?\nGrad A:Um , what do you mean ? If the Go - there says No , then the Go - there is {disfmarker}\nGrad D:I don't get it .\nGrad A:I don't u understand .\nGrad B:Um .\nGrad A:Like , the Go - there depends on all those four things .\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad B:But , what are the values of the Go - there - discourse ?\nGrad A:Well , it depends on the situation . If the discourse is strongly indicating that {disfmarker}\nGrad B:Yeah , but , uh , we have no discourse input .\nGrad A:Oh , I see . The d See , uh , specifically in our situation , D and O are gonna be , uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Sure . So , whatever .\nGrad D:So , so far we have {disfmarker} Is that what the Keith node is ?\nGrad B:Yep .\nGrad D:OK . And you 're taking it out ? {pause} for now ?\nGrad B:Well , this is D {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad B:OK , this , I can {disfmarker} I can get it in here .\nGrad D:All the D 's are {disfmarker}\nGrad B:I can get it in here , so th We have the , uh , um , sk let 's {disfmarker} let 's call it \" Keith - Johno\nGrad A:Johno ?\nGrad B:node \" . There is an H {comment} somewhere printed .\nGrad C:There you go .\nGrad A:Yeah . People have the same problem with my name .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nGrad A:Oops .\nGrad B:And , um ,\nGrad C:Does th th does the H go b before the A or after the A ?\nGrad A:Oh , in my name ? Before the A .\nGrad C:Yeah . OK , good . Cuz you kn When you said people have the same problem , I thought {disfmarker} Cuz my H goes after the uh e e e the v\nGrad A:People have the inverse problem with my name .\nGrad C:OK . I always have to check , every time y I send you an email , {comment} a past email of yours , {comment} to make sure I 'm spelling your name correctly .\nGrad A:Yeah . That 's good .\nGrad C:I worry about you .\nGrad A:I appreciate that .\nGrad B:But , when you abbreviate yourself as the \" Basman \" , you don't use any H 's .\nGrad A:\" Basman \" ? Yeah , it 's because of the chessplayer named Michael Basman , who is my hero .\nGrad B:OK .\nGrad C:You 're a geek . It 's O K . I\nGrad B:OK .\nGrad C:How do you pronou How do you pronounce your name ?\nGrad D:Eva .\nGrad C:Eva ?\nGrad A:Not Eva ?\nGrad D:Yeah .\nGrad C:What if I were {disfmarker} What if I were to call you Eva ?\nGrad D:I 'd probably still respond to it . I 've had people call me Eva , but I don't know .\nGrad C:No , not just Eva , Eva . Like if I u take the V and s pronounce it like it was a German V ?\nGrad B:Which is F .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nGrad D:Um , no idea then .\nGrad B:Voiced .\nGrad D:What ?\nGrad C:It sounds like an F .\nGrad D:I {disfmarker}\nGrad C:There 's also an F in German ,\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad B:Well , it 's just the difference between voiced and unvoiced .\nGrad C:which is why I {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad C:As long as that 's O K .\nGrad D:Um .\nGrad C:I mean , I might slip out and say it accidentally . That 's all I 'm saying .\nGrad D:That 's fine .\nGrad A:Yeah . It doesn't matter what those nodes are , anyway , because we 'll just make the weights \" zero \" for now .\nGrad B:Yep . We 'll make them zero for now , because it {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who knows what they come up with , what 's gonna come in there . OK . And , um , then should we start on Thursday ?\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad B:And not meet tomorrow ?\nGrad A:Sure .\nGrad B:OK . I 'll send an email , make a time suggestion .\nGrad C:Wait , maybe it 's OK , so that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that we can {disfmarker} that we have one node per construction . Cuz even in people , like , they don't know what you 're talking about if you 're using some sort of strange construction .\nGrad B:Yeah , they would still c sort of get the closest , best fit .\nGrad C:Well , yeah , but I mean , the {disfmarker} uh , I mean , that 's what the construction parser would do .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:Uh , I mean , if you said something completely arbitrary , it would f find the closest construction ,\nGrad B:OK .\nGrad C:right ? But if you said something that was completel er {disfmarker} h theoretically the construction parser would do that {disfmarker} But if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever , n people wouldn't have any idea what you were talking about .\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:Like \" Bus dog fried egg . \" I mean . You know .\nGrad B:Or , if even something Chinese , for example .\nGrad C:Or , something in Mandarin , yeah . Or Cantonese , as the case may be . What do you think about that , Bhaskara ?\nGrad A:I mean {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} But how many constructions do {disfmarker} could we possibly have {pause} nodes for ?\nGrad C:In this system , or in r\nGrad A:No , we . Like , when people do this kind of thing .\nGrad C:Oh , when p How many constructions do people have ?\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:I have not {comment} the slightest idea .\nGrad A:Is it considered to be like in {disfmarker} are they considered to be like very , uh , sort of s abstract things ?\nGrad C:Every noun is a construction .\nGrad A:OK , so it 's like in the {pause} thousands .\nGrad C:The {disfmarker} Yeah . Any {disfmarker} any form - meaning pair , to my understanding , is a construction .\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad B:So .\nGrad C:And form u starts at the level of noun {disfmarker} Or actually , maybe even sounds .\nGrad B:Phoneme . Yep .\nGrad C:Yeah . And goes upwards until you get the ditransitive construction .\nGrad A:S\nGrad C:And then , of course , the c I guess , maybe there can be the {disfmarker} Can there be combinations of the dit\nGrad A:Discourse - level {pause} constructions .\nGrad C:Yeah . The \" giving a speech \" construction ,\nGrad B:Rhetorical constructions .\nGrad A:Yes .\nGrad B:Yeah . But , I mean , you know , you can probably count {disfmarker} count the ways . I mean .\nGrad C:It 's probab Yeah , I would s definitely say it 's finite .\nGrad B:Yeah .\nGrad C:And at least in compilers , that 's all that really matters , as long as your analysis is finite .\nGrad A:How 's that ? {nonvocalsound} How it can be finite , again ?\nGrad C:Nah , I can't think of a way it would be infinite .\nGrad B:Well , you can come up with new constructions .\nGrad C:Yeah . {comment} If the {disfmarker} if your {disfmarker} if your brain was totally non - deterministic , then perhaps there 's a way to get , uh , infin an infinite number of constructions that you 'd have to worry about .\nGrad A:But , I mean , in the {nonvocalsound} practical sense , it 's impossible .\nGrad C:Right . Cuz if we have a fixed number of neurons {disfmarker} ?\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:So the best - case scenario would be the number of constructions {disfmarker} or , the worst - case scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons .\nGrad A:Well , two to the power of the number of neurons .\nGrad C:Right . But still finite .\nGrad B:OK .\nGrad C:No , wait . Not necessarily , is it ? We can end the {pause} meeting . I just {disfmarker} Can't you use different var different levels of activation ? across , uh {disfmarker} lots of different neurons , to specify different values ?\nGrad B:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:Um , yeah , but there 's , like , a certain level of {disfmarker}\nGrad C:There 's a bandwidth issue ,\nGrad A:Bandw - Yeah , so you can't do better than something .\nGrad C:right ? Yeah .\nGrad B:Turn off the mikes . Otherwise it gets really tough for the tr\n",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay , is everybody ready ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nMarketing:Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay ?\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do\nIndustrial Designer:Mm ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay you want me to start right now ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , could you um put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time .\nProject Manager:Okay . You're participant four .\nMarketing:I'm participant four I believe . Yes uh-huh .\nProject Manager:Okay , and now I can uh full screen .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Open .\nProject Manager:Uh , okay , okay .\nMarketing:There we go . Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves ,\nIndustrial Designer:And then full screen .\nMarketing:so the functional requirements are {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide . Cause that's where m my discussion starts . Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um {vocalsound} I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ {vocalsound} whatever you want it to do {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Hmm hmm . Mm .\nMarketing:So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we {disfmarker} anybody can th throw anything in\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nMarketing:So that was um what I meant there , and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present . Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . And take out their wallet and buy it . So it's gotta be really attractive and it {disfmarker} but it's gotta go to market by September , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um {vocalsound} and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know ,\nUser Interface:What features .\nMarketing:what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,\nUser Interface:S sellable . Yes {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:'cause we gotta sell this sizzle {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Okay can we go to the next slide please ? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be {vocalsound} {disfmarker} And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ?\nMarketing:I have to wind up ? Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . Um the one thing for example {disfmarker} something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:because that's sort of outdated with the internet ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:and according to to higher management the {disfmarker} it should only control the T_V_ ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things ,\nIndustrial Designer:Complicated , yeah , of course .\nProject Manager:and they are concerned with the time to market .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Of course , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , so that's something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their {disfmarker} that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at . These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things , so it's only gonna be T_V_ ,\nMarketing:Okay so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Alright , thanks for that . Um alright now {vocalsound} other things that I found out on {disfmarker} in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the {disfmarker} a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ? Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . Uh because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead . They're never gonna come back and buy it . You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much . Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay that's uh about it for me right now .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . And uh who would be next , uh , I guess that would be you . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah 'kay .\nProject Manager:You want me to get your slide show up ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah sure .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:And you are number three ?\nIndustrial Designer:Number two ,\nProject Manager:Number two .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh can you make it uh full screen please ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:No , it's like a well you you have to press here . The cup cup shape here ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah , uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:The thir third .\nProject Manager:There , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah exactly . Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . Um can you go to the next sli slide please ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se {vocalsound} send a signal ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Signal .\nIndustrial Designer:and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control\nUser Interface:Receive .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .\nUser Interface:Multi-purpose .\nProject Manager:Yo and it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:yeah {disfmarker} but it's so {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Um . So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . So uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a {disfmarker} there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions .\nMarketing:Mm okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So can you go to the next slide please ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they {disfmarker} those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's {disfmarker} this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . And there should be a child lock , like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible\nProject Manager:Yeah well {disfmarker} yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but it uh\nMarketing:Well we already eliminated that .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah yeah yeah\nUser Interface:Eliminated .\nIndustrial Designer:so it's it's okay , yeah , yeah . And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and um so that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun {disfmarker} the fun shape .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , yeah and colours also , different colours , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm colours .\nMarketing:And that {disfmarker} you you say that won't add too much to the budget ?\nIndustrial Designer:No no no , it won't uh I don't think it will be like ,\nMarketing:To d the shape is uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It just build a mould basically and uh you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter .\nProject Manager:As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in {disfmarker} having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh yes .\nMarketing:Is that gonna be a possible ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Cause that might help with the marketing .\nProject Manager:I think we will have to look at the budget on that\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that will be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but I think in principle that that would be {disfmarker} that would be kind of fun , you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Silly for children .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , for children , yeah exactly .\nMarketing:silly for children\nProject Manager:Like an animal or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:or a little animal shape or in a {disfmarker} or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Like a doll , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's what , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , exactly . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are {disfmarker} which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so .\nMarketing:Mm . Well , I think {disfmarker} I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep , yeah .\nMarketing:because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my {disfmarker} what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:The changing modes was something {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's like you know {vocalsound} yeah .\nMarketing:I mean you and I , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:changing modes is nothing for us , but people who {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} N and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and and it's a small button and and it {disfmarker} they don't press it exactly\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yes .\nProject Manager:and they're very frustrated you know .\nUser Interface:Something else .\nMarketing:And that's {disfmarker} and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel , and um {vocalsound} you don't feel the mode change .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah you don't {vocalsound} us yeah yeah , usually . Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah shapes also , different shapes .\nMarketing:You know , like the {disfmarker} a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that will {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Channels .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nMarketing:But we'll get to that with you .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's right , yeah . Now that's a good point . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:So yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , that's that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good one ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and we display a clock .\nMarketing:because the clock would be really friendly ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:and and when is your favourite show coming on\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yes {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah that's that's good , the clock is good .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh can you go to the next slide please ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch . And uh bulbs . Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose ,\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source , not from {disfmarker} through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we can have that . Whenever the T_V_ is on , remote controller will have a light .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And then uh infrared bulbs . Um this is like uh when it is dark .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And battery , there should be a battery for power supply ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and a chip ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so there should be wires . And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .\nUser Interface:To keep the remote ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Case .\nUser Interface:A case holder . A holder {disfmarker} remote holder .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , holder .\nProject Manager:Holder , yeah , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um uh can you move onto the next slide . Um next sli slide please . Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website , uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:That's it , that's it from me now .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So it {disfmarker} um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there ? Or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager:Well , you don't have to .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay . So it might be helpful if we had a look at that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah if you want . Yeah , it's okay .\nMarketing:Okay , thank you . Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , it's actually there now , there on the screen .\nProject Manager:This one ?\nMarketing:Yeah , okay , thank you .\nProject Manager:And Francine ?\nUser Interface:Participant two .\nProject Manager:You are number two ?\nUser Interface:Yes . No no , I'm three .\nProject Manager:You're three . Would you want it full full screen ?\nUser Interface:I can make it full ? Yes yes yes .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm ? Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay . As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah can you please go onto the next slide ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . Now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice .\nProject Manager:On the on on the remote . Yeah , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yes . Yes . So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel .\nProject Manager:Yes . By your child , mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And uh the uh the uh and the {disfmarker} one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down , like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm , 'kay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .\nUser Interface:Yes ,\nMarketing:And an alarm clock , yeah that should {disfmarker} that should be okay .\nUser Interface:and as John Reece said the buttons can be , uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently . So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he uh he should not be harmed in any way .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:And findings , uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh {disfmarker} So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used {disfmarker} which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . Next slide . And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . Not , uh no uh like it can {disfmarker} it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that . And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .\nIndustrial Designer:It's like a t okay , it's like a timer {gap} it's like a lock to the television .\nProject Manager:Timer , yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Timer . Yeah and then you can use a timer as well . Yes . Yeah that's it .\nProject Manager:Uh okay , now I have {disfmarker} On my slide show basically we already {disfmarker} we have already done the agenda , and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that . However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . And uh what function , working design , how how does it work .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:So these are the two things we should come up wit with . So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group . Um . I guess in many ways everybody . Everybody who has a T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , T_V_ , yeah .\nUser Interface:T_V_ television we was .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Don't T_V_ , yeah .\nProject Manager:There are a few but in general not . {vocalsound} Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . We have {disfmarker} we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:So this {disfmarker} these are just some thoughts I have on it , and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That has a lot of {disfmarker} that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever {vocalsound} you know\nUser Interface:Different colours .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:That's right .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:You can make a banana shaped one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:yeah , for example you know .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Mm .\nProject Manager:But the question is really , who is our target group .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Do we look at one target group ? {vocalsound} And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Respect . Mm .\nUser Interface:Okay . No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .\nProject Manager:With with {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know .\nProject Manager:Well that's that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But in a family {disfmarker} in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} yeah . Children and everybody , yeah .\nUser Interface:They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know .\nMarketing:What about the electronics ? That's not really gonna change much , is it ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Cost effective .\nIndustrial Designer:No , it it doesn't cost , yeah .\nProject Manager:No {vocalsound}\nMarketing:That {vocalsound} that w that won't change much , will it uh ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,\nMarketing:I d I wouldn't think so .\nProject Manager:and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . I mean the basic design I understand will be the same ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say {vocalsound} uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So that remains to s to be seen but {vocalsound} uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_ .\nMarketing:That's right ,\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:and can we {disfmarker} can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , well that's that's the question .\nMarketing:Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm hmm .\nMarketing:And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh no . Mm , I I I don't think no . It's not .\nMarketing:Um you as an industrial person ?\nProject Manager:Well maybe there's {disfmarker} there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ?\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and maybe something like that ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:that in each package you know you have {disfmarker} you you have {disfmarker} you have for example uh {vocalsound} you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .\nMarketing:Well there's a real idea yeah . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You know ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yes .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That's right ,\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker} but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package ,\nMarketing:Uh yeah .\nProject Manager:then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:An alternate package .\nProject Manager:an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface:But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we {disfmarker} if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people .\nProject Manager:Well I think {disfmarker} I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well I think we can only aff {gap} , yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:and what the only change is gonna be um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:the funct d t yeah uh {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Cosmetic .\nUser Interface:Of th okay .\nProject Manager:the functional {vocalsound} functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message .\nMarketing:Warning , finish meeting now . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Finish meeting now . Um um .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:But I think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:If we do some more research , maybe we {gap} .\nProject Manager:I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .\nUser Interface:Okay ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm yeah ,\nProject Manager:Do we agree , do we ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Okay but we have to l\nProject Manager:Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , of course , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Okay , fair enough .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay ? So now I understand it's lunch break .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And um . So that's what we will do .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So hank you very much .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:And we'll see you after lunch .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting started off with Marketing leading the discussion on product positioning of the remote, which was going to be an impulse purchase and certain requirements from management, such as the remote only controlling the television. Then, Industrial Designer shared the working design and main components of the remote. Also, they discussed functions that they would add to the remote such as a child lock and the appearance of the remote, such as having a comfortable shape and different colours. User Interface then raised some features that the remote ought to have such as having a timer. Finally, Project Manager stated their target group, which was people aged ten to forty, and they discussed how to cater to their needs, such as having large buttons for the elderly.",

Sorry I'm a little late .\nProject Manager:No problem .\nMarketing:Got stuck in the traffic .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting . There he is . Yes . Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . {vocalsound} Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um we will do the {disfmarker} this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors . Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . Then there's the zero to {disfmarker} one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Um , {vocalsound} is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Sure uh just pop in at any time .\nMarketing:Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .\nUser Interface:Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh {disfmarker} So um {disfmarker} You put it uh {disfmarker} you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And you {disfmarker} But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . Okay . Um {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons .\nUser Interface:Oh yeah ?\nProject Manager:But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . So I'm wondering if we if we neely {disfmarker} really need all of those buttons .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this .\nProject Manager:That's right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Long time . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:If you put {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put {vocalsound} press uh the button and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , {vocalsound} you can't leave out the number buttons I guess .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's rather basic already .\nMarketing:Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , they're {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Just n normal plain buttons .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:It's rather hard to draw on the white-board .\nUser Interface:it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff .\nProject Manager:Yeah . 'Kay .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Just for recognition .\nUser Interface:Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um {disfmarker} Y uh\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:s some uh remote controls uh do it also ,\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case .\nUser Interface:Nay .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:So they jump out .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh that's about it .\nProject Manager:That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:If we see {disfmarker} I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible .\nMarketing:Since it rechargeable .\nProject Manager:It's rechargeable . That's right .\nUser Interface:Yeah we can u just uh {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . That's two Euros off . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:'Kay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh {vocalsound} to save there .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think we have to keep that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons . So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Because you have to {disfmarker} we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so if we {disfmarker} Let's fir first count the buttons we have now .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker} Sixteen , I believe so .\nProject Manager:Because I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros . So ,\nUser Interface:Uh seventeen . Uh with the help button .\nProject Manager:seventeen .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , including the help ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Damn .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Uh seventeen .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Wouldn't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Fifteen buttons .\nMarketing:Yeah . No . That wouldn't be an option .\nProject Manager:And this is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?\nProject Manager:No those are one , I think .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Where did uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , think actually there're two buttons ,\nUser Interface:Uh , it's just one button .\nMarketing:aren't they ?\nUser Interface:But , um {disfmarker} Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah but th it's not stated in this files .\nUser Interface:It's just a {gap} .\nProject Manager:So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing\nMarketing:Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .\nProject Manager:That's possibility as well .\nMarketing:That would cut the cost .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} And it's good for the design as well . So you can make {disfmarker} Uh let's see . If you make this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Looks a bit like uh a cross . {vocalsound} Plus . Min .\nUser Interface:But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper .\nProject Manager:Uh s yeah channel .\nUser Interface:So uh ,\nProject Manager:Yeah w\nUser Interface:we've still got four buttons , but just um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah th I think they count uh the materials .\nUser Interface:You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah on the chip there . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That's right . That's right .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But I think because we have the advanced chip\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} we can just count this as one button .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker} No but I think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh that's that's a big cost .\nProject Manager:I think they uh try t\nIndustrial Designer:If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .\nProject Manager:That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Only the docking station , I guess .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Which isn't the {disfmarker} the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's not even taken into the price .\nProject Manager:That's extra . {vocalsound} That's extra . That's right .\nMarketing:Maybe we should to a different supplier .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's an option .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Poland . Something . {vocalsound} Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's what I'm wondering . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's a point .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ?\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So um {disfmarker} Yeah . We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or {disfmarker} Can't uh go um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:Well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features .\nUser Interface:Nay .\nProject Manager:Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it .\nUser Interface:Is it impossible to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:The margin will get too small . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .\nProject Manager:It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say {disfmarker} Or you can take the single chip .\nUser Interface:I don't think so .\nMarketing:It would be a be a pretty rigid one .\nUser Interface:S Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But , you can't use uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Ten .\nProject Manager:There it is . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But then w Good looking .\nUser Interface:Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh attractive uh o options .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think it's uh difficult as well ,\nMarketing:Or b\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:No remote . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . Then w\nUser Interface:Scroll-wheel's one .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Because then we save ten buttons .\nUser Interface:No , it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Then we have five and one .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced {disfmarker} W uh , we're getting close . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:We're getting closer .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:But how does scroll-wheel work here ?\nProject Manager:Then you will {disfmarker} Or maybe you can um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button .\nProject Manager:Alright . It's gotta scroll and push .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You could just not scroll for a half a second .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .\nIndustrial Designer:So you won't need a button .\nMarketing:I think that would be like the end of our usability .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But it would definitely crop cost , a lot .\nUser Interface:D yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And we need the battery . {vocalsound} And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ?\nIndustrial Designer:If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .\nProject Manager:It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:And we can save a Euro by a flat design . That's an option we can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Ja ja .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:Then we're almost there .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So if we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah but I think that's {disfmarker} That is a big advantage ,\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} Yeah {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:if we're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah it's a big advantage .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But um , it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Can we use {disfmarker} can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?\nUser Interface:Uh , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think so . Yeah .\nProject Manager:If you push it three times ?\nMarketing:Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there .\nUser Interface:{gap} {disfmarker} But if you push the teletext button twice {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think that's the case on most {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's uh {disfmarker} One m uh one b uh , a few buttons .\nProject Manager:Ah that's not really that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people ,\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:Holding a remote with {vocalsound} which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel .\nProject Manager:I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple . Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .\nMarketing:True . True .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . Mm eraser ? And we put uh {disfmarker} Looks a bit odd maybe . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's a pretty big scroll wheel .\nProject Manager:That is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Something like that .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . And these are two buttons then .\nIndustrial Designer:We could make two buttons out of that . And just um {disfmarker} If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's really a good good idea , I think . And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .\nIndustrial Designer:More obvious .\nProject Manager:So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . That's right .\nIndustrial Designer:So if we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . That's m that's better .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So this is five buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall .\nProject Manager:Y yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button\nProject Manager:Mm yeah . Uh yeah , and then you can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:you get a a much smaller remote .\nProject Manager:That's right .\nUser Interface:Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it sh\nProject Manager:So we can decrease this one to four buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nMarketing:Right now we have five .\nUser Interface:But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's no problem .\nUser Interface:Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:And cases come right out of the machine .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . I think this is a really easy one . Um , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ?\nMarketing:Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:But then again , {gap} all these changes are not really okay with me .\nIndustrial Designer:Richard's argument was very good . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:But since we just have to .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We have to cut costs . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah I'm ag\nMarketing:I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend {vocalsound} eighteen dollars a a remote .\nProject Manager:Ask for more money . Yeah . Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah .\nMarketing:Or do some market research and see what the options are .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . So this is scroll . I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . {vocalsound} Before we went on to the to the whole design .\nMarketing:Yes . Definitely . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:The th\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker} I'm glad we could make a bit .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than {vocalsound} this one .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's pretty different .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It will . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them .\nProject Manager:No , but I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .\nProject Manager:I think the most {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels .\nProject Manager:That's right .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We can let l\nUser Interface:So maybe it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh {disfmarker} But we will see .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:That's true . Might uh {disfmarker} might be confusing too .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's definitely right .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But very special , so uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I would buy it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . But you're not sixty . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's right . I would buy it if I was six . {vocalsound} No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ? Uh , yes they are .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No . But we can go on with the project evaluation .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , the project process .\nMarketing:So um , I like set up all these criteria . And evaluation of the thingy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot . I should {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:There we are . Evaluation criteria . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Thank you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Go ahead .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We've got five minutes I think for those criteria .\nMarketing:Five more minutes ?\nProject Manager:No we've got fifteen minutes but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Uh yes . What ?\nMarketing:'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier .\nProject Manager:Uh yeah .\nMarketing:Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ? Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is {disfmarker} If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? And {disfmarker} So we're supposed to evaluate it right now .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Let's see . Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I tried to\nMarketing:Interesting .\nProject Manager:but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm . 'Kay .\nMarketing:Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?\nProject Manager:I think it's fancy .\nIndustrial Designer:Six .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Six .\nUser Interface:Uh six . Yeah .\nMarketing:We all go for six ? Good . Um , is the design innovative ?\nProject Manager:Very . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm . Sh\nMarketing:I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons .\nProject Manager:Subtitles , buttons . Yeah . Seven .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Seven ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Should be do-able .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's right .\nMarketing:Is the design easy to use ?\nUser Interface:Mm . Not really .\nProject Manager:That's a bit dodgy .\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker} Would be for us . But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:For old people I I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five .\nUser Interface:W\nIndustrial Designer:Four or five . Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Four .\nMarketing:I'd go for four , too .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Is it functional ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Is the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ?\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:N Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think we do . Do we have too many functions ?\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:I don't think so . It's pretty slim .\nProject Manager:Think it's uh seven .\nMarketing:Seven . Oh , and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and {disfmarker} R_S_I_ influences ?\nUser Interface:Mm m\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , we haven't thought of that one .\nProject Manager:It was .\nMarketing:Think we do .\nProject Manager:I had them worked out . Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Are the production costs within the preset limits ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well they are now .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Does the design fit the group of focus ?\nUser Interface:Mm , th yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think that's a three .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh I think it's better .\nMarketing:I think it doesn't .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} We have to test it s But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I still {disfmarker} I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy .\nMarketing:I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .\nUser Interface:Uh , yeah , true .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I would give it a four .\nMarketing:I'm not sure . I think I'd go for two .\nUser Interface:I go for three . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Then we have to do the three . It's the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Kay . Is the company company recognisable ?\nProject Manager:Yes it is .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:Well , we have the logo there .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . And we have the removable front cases . So , I think it's very recognisable .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:So that will be this . I was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this .\nProject Manager:We've got a calculate it . Mm ?\nIndustrial Designer:Twendag sieven an twendag .\nMarketing:Is this {disfmarker} Like after this , are we done ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:N We've gonna {disfmarker} We're going to evaluate it .\nMarketing:We're gonna go to our other room again . Well , anyhow . These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? No .\nProject Manager:{gap} Forty nine .\nMarketing:Nine ? Uh , minus one . Minus three , minus four . {vocalsound} Minus four . So that would be minus eight . Forty one out of forty nine .\nProject Manager:Forty one . That's {disfmarker} Around eighty percent .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:What is it ?\nMarketing:Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here .\nProject Manager:That's eighty four percent . I think that's a pretty nice score .\nUser Interface:Hmm . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Hmm . 'Kay . So that will be the evaluation .\nProject Manager:Thank you . So , that brings us to the project evaluation . Yep . Thank you .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Project process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ? {vocalsound} Along the process ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah . But it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's right . So lack of information about prices .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That's true .\nMarketing:Yeah . Definitely .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh {disfmarker} Okay . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ?\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Not too much . {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , true . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The room was {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And I would've liked to go for the younger users also .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nMarketing:And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Restrictions . Internet access . 'Kay . Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you {disfmarker} two of you with the uh last phase ?\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , was okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{gap} tasks . Okay . Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? Or were they too much ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but {disfmarker} The digital the digital pen is very nice .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Smart-board .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:If it wants to download its uh data . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Failed download . Smart-board was irritating . {vocalsound} So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:A flip-over or a more precise uh digit\nUser Interface:A flipper's uh easier , so {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Faster as well , I think .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Flip-over .\nUser Interface:But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I tried to open the file on my laptop ,\nUser Interface:Yeah ? No ?\nIndustrial Designer:No . Didn't work .\nMarketing:but {vocalsound} not possible .\nProject Manager:Uh you need a smart board uh application I think .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But I think you can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:T can uh can you export it uh like a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image .\nMarketing:{gap} no .\nProject Manager:Must {disfmarker} Yeah must be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Should've done that then .\nProject Manager:So the sharing of the information was uh was okay ?\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nMarketing:Pen is here .\nProject Manager:Uh , network .\nUser Interface:Uh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Yeah , pen is here on the table .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh , yeah . So you can {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {gap} It's possible .\nUser Interface:It's possible .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:That's nice . Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? Or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh {disfmarker} Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev {gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . So everybody puts his own score .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And then {vocalsound} it mediates the score ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and you can get one {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's better . So that's uh {disfmarker} How do we call ? Evaluation criteria . Okay . Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Because I think then that we get to our last sheet . Are the costs within the budget ?\nUser Interface:Mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:They are .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Considering we are not going to make a docking station .\nProject Manager:Do we {disfmarker} Docking station . That's a good point .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh and I think you can compensate that as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Perhaps .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or what was it ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Fifty grand .\nProject Manager:Fifteen fifteen million . I think we will . {vocalsound} If we gonna export this product . It's innovative .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . Sometimes .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , still I think {disfmarker} I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people .\nProject Manager:You can do more . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Ah .\nMarketing:So maybe we should just re-focus .\nProject Manager:Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .\nUser Interface:Ah .\nMarketing:Or specifically for younger people .\nProject Manager:That's one thing you can change it with .\nUser Interface:Ah .\nMarketing:That's true .\nProject Manager:So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage .\nMarketing:Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Party party .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think .\nUser Interface:Where's the champagne ?\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:I don't know . I didn't get a message from the from ending of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh , I believe y uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh I think I have one now .\nMarketing:Oh you did .\nProject Manager:Five more minutes ? Oh that's nice .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Then we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . Or we can put these in the project folder as well . Maybe that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Export as picture , I think .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm . This is another network , I guess . Does somebody see the project folder ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't . Hmm . My Documents .\nUser Interface:Uh maybe uh they will save it . So uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents\nMarketing:Yeah , it probably will .\nProject Manager:and uh {disfmarker} That's okay . Okay . {vocalsound} I think I'm going to make our final presentation now .\nMarketing:Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?\nUser Interface:Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Questionnaire . I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room .\nUser Interface:So uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Hopefully my pen will download its software . Oh . Or data .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . That'd be nice .\n",
        "summary": "The whole meeting was the final meeting of the project for discussion about the final design and project evaluation. Firstly, though Project Manager came late, he efficiently started the prototype presentation, during which Industrial Designer and User Interface presented the final design they worked out together. However, part of the features contained in their design, particularly too many buttons, were effectively rejected in the finance phase to reduce cost. Then, Marketing hosted the product evaluation and calculated a total score for their new remote control. After that, Project Manager guided the process evaluation and led the project to the closing phase.",

Thanks for coming to this meeting .\nMarketing:Hm .\nProject Manager:S how we doing on our remote ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We have some {disfmarker} we have some ideas and some uh ideas for what people want .\nUser Interface:Uh we yes s I've lo {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . Then I believe each of you have a presentation . Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully . And uh then we'll have the closing . {vocalsound} Um which we'll have forty minutes for . Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um {vocalsound} who was responsible for what . I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . Um {vocalsound} Ryan is our User Interface Designer . And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different . Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . Um and that was our last meeting . So um why don't um {disfmarker} Do each of you have a presentation ?\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay . I'll hand it off to you and um {disfmarker} Does anyone {disfmarker} do you wanna go first ?\nMarketing:Sure .\nProject Manager:So we can maybe see what uh what the people want .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What was it ? Function ?\nIndustrial Designer:Eight . F_ eight .\nMarketing:F_ eight ? Well . {vocalsound} How do I get it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Slide show .\nProject Manager:To go to the next one ?\nMarketing:Oh right right right .\nProject Manager:Yeah you click on that guy .\nMarketing:That one ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Alright . Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . Oh gosh , I've no idea . {vocalsound} G\nUser Interface:Just press the arrow keys I think . Usually goes to it .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sorry I actually need to see something else on my screen .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hit F_ eight again .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think .\nMarketing:And then ? Again ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ?\nMarketing:No I want something else on mine . Is that possible ?\nProject Manager:Yeah but I think you have to hit escape . And then you can {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay but now you don't have that .\nProject Manager:Oh hit F_ eight again .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Sorry guys .\nProject Manager:I know . I did the same thing . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And then it should come up here shortly . 'Kay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and\nProject Manager:I think {disfmarker} oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ?\nMarketing:yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Oh well .\nProject Manager:I'm not sure . You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think .\nMarketing:Yeah . It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research . And I was sent a report that was {disfmarker} I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Just jus\nUser Interface:Is is it j just just\nMarketing:Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ?\nUser Interface:just using it\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take {disfmarker} thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A repetitive strain injury .\nMarketing:What is it ?\nUser Interface:Just repetitive strain injury . I think . That's what I guess .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at {disfmarker} the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think {disfmarker} and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . And that's it .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Very nice . Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Wait can I look at that real quick ? {gap} .\nMarketing:Oh yeah . Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . {vocalsound} {gap} Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . Um {vocalsound} the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to {disfmarker} i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um {disfmarker} Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . But one is uh user-centred . That is the one on the left . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is {gap} engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um {disfmarker} {gap} which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the {gap} have said and the market research and stuff {gap} probably looking at something that should be user-centred . Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away {disfmarker} if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under {disfmarker} some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um {disfmarker} Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings {gap} market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And that's it .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} cable there . Thank you .\nProject Manager:What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on uh the i\nUser Interface:On something on the image of it .\nProject Manager:the image of it .\nUser Interface:Uh the f the actual design .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Good . Good .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . Right . So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so um {vocalsound} I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . Um just {disfmarker} This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . {vocalsound} Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . Um parts are cheaper as well . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . This is where my people screwed up basically .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . Right . Um which is usually a battery right ? {vocalsound} Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself {vocalsound} . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . That sends out the signal . Of course the signal differs accordingly . Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . And {disfmarker} Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response . Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well . {vocalsound} The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that {disfmarker} that's something we can discuss . And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . Who knows ? {vocalsound} Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact {vocalsound} available cheap enough , developed enough . But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to\nProject Manager:So we could {disfmarker} the the\nIndustrial Designer:to the industrial design department .\nProject Manager:the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Expensive it's gonna be get uh . Yeah .\nProject Manager:But people have said that they would {disfmarker} well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So possibly it might be worth the investment .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o {gap} if it's on your phone .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I agree . Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And you need to sort of take into light languages and then {vocalsound} different dialects I suppose as well .\nProject Manager:I {disfmarker} myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know , you {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And wou I don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Volume up . Volume down . Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I I don't know .\nMarketing:Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know .\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker} As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But practically I don't think it's {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . It'll wear off .\nMarketing:Gets old yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um {disfmarker} Let's see here .\nUser Interface:Do you wanna put your cord back in ?\nProject Manager:Yeah I guess so .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Trade you .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} go . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Now I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided {disfmarker} y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . Um no teletext . Um {disfmarker} So we don't have to worry about that . Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . And we could probably get away with black too but {disfmarker} So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use . Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . We want something that looks good . Um we want something that's simple . We want something that you can find easily . Um {disfmarker} And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . It's gonna cost more . S the young the younger people say that they like it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:But um it's probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . Um {disfmarker} And that way we can focus on our form .\nUser Interface:I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . Is that {disfmarker} if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . Um that you you should put it back in . Your remote . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep {vocalsound} to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought .\nProject Manager:That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball .\nUser Interface:Yeah it would be quite good .\nProject Manager:Or or with {disfmarker} you know I guess with any form that that would be good .\nUser Interface:The ball could sit on a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:You know that could be the charger . For you know\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . And that would be {disfmarker} or solar . Or you know {disfmarker} However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:With the locator button . Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um like\nIndustrial Designer:Well\nProject Manager:if\nIndustrial Designer:you still do .\nProject Manager:we still have the how to hold on to it\nIndustrial Designer:You s you still {disfmarker} W yeah . You put it on t on the couch table .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's gonna roll away .\nIndustrial Designer:While you're watching ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Rolls away\nIndustrial Designer:it's gonna roll off . So\nMarketing:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that's not an issue really .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} So I guess after the meeting {vocalsound} we'll have some questionnaires . And uh and some summaries for for what's going on . Um then we'll take lunch . Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . Um {disfmarker} I'll do the minutes . Uh let's see . It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . Um chips , the what chips we need\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nProject Manager:and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot . User interface concept , we want it to be something simple .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} Minimal number of buttons . I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . That's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Did you have time earlier to to work on that . Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Not really . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'll yeah I'll have a look , try {gap} look at the actual appearance in the next break .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . The ball is probably not a good idea .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:And even something that's held like that might be difficult .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So that I think it still has to be a variation . On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? That way we could l I mean if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ? Um {disfmarker} Would that {disfmarker} you think that would help us find um a specific form ? That we would would wanna pick out ?\nUser Interface:D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . I {gap} find anything more on that .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay . So um we know that the remote's gonna have to be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . Um yellow and {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:or the\nUser Interface:Bottom perhaps\nProject Manager:you know . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe we could sketch a {disfmarker} so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . You know . Um maybe we could flare it or something . You know . So it's more {disfmarker} of course this will look like a bone then .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} go ahead and erase this . Um {disfmarker} Hope everyone memorised that uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You {disfmarker} I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:They've gone from big brick block things , which is {gap} a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things .\nProject Manager:Yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right ? Except for me now . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But they are all ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and you had a handbag to carry it around in . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hm .\nProject Manager:Um you know with minimal number of buttons . I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . Uh you've got volume , up and down . Channel up and down .\nMarketing:Power .\nProject Manager:Power . Usually at the top . Um a mute .\nIndustrial Designer:That's the classical design .\nProject Manager:That's that's pretty much all you need I think . Um {disfmarker} A menu button , maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:So you know . If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um {disfmarker} or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad .\nProject Manager:'Kay so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Talk about maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound} f look at that from the side , there maybe .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Which is technically the easiest option . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So .\nProject Manager:Like a wheel on your mouse .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , sort of like that .\nProject Manager:Sort of .\nIndustrial Designer:You can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'S a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I know . You know what I'm getting at here ,\nProject Manager:Look g yeah . Looks good .\nIndustrial Designer:fel look at it from the side . It's {gap} like that .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Uh {disfmarker} Then you hold it in your hand like this . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the {disfmarker} or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side .\nUser Interface:Yes {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:To the thumb . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Mm .\nUser Interface:To the thumb yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . With the lesser used functions on this part ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Behind .\nIndustrial Designer:and then it slides into that part . And out .\nUser Interface:Definitely . {gap} just like o on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . So you know you just sort of have your hand\nIndustrial Designer:Mm well I was just thinking , this this of course causes\nUser Interface:Yeah . Right on the {disfmarker} and your thumb would be up here type thing .\nIndustrial Designer:causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So .\nUser Interface:Yeah that's also true . {gap} instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:But I mean {gap} the older so\nProject Manager:Yeah {vocalsound} is everyone {disfmarker} who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? You guys all right-handed ?\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:Right-handed ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . So\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:I'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's right .\nMarketing:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Like the written language . {vocalsound} Or English .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . {vocalsound} Special order .\nProject Manager:Maybe . Ow . I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um but that's that's good . That's {disfmarker} w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . Um {disfmarker} At least for what buttons we're gonna use . Um {disfmarker} So we've got uh {disfmarker} I like the scroll , the scroll action and the {disfmarker} {gap} .\nUser Interface:I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of {disfmarker} that sort of {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . And then your thumb would do {disfmarker} you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Kinda like holding a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . {vocalsound} That minimises it size-wise as well .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Minimise its size . It could be you know really quite small .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Zapping functions .\nIndustrial Designer:That's it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Could be good .\nProject Manager:So two remotes in one . But then would be easier to lose one or the other .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right . Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It actually is your coffee table .\nIndustrial Designer:Make it a piece of furniture .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound} yes . Yes , there you go .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Or a statue or something . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Well we need to finish up here . Um {disfmarker} So for the next {disfmarker} So for the next um {disfmarker} before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on {disfmarker} you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Let's go with our our uh rounded kind of fit in your hand {disfmarker} let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . So both of those concepts .\nUser Interface:How well it'll work yeah .\nProject Manager:And uh okay I think we made some good progress here .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Alright .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} see you in {disfmarker} I dunno . I gu I guess we'll take lunch in about uh half an hour . {vocalsound} Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\n",
        "summary": "First, the project manager briefly reviewed the last meeting. According to market research, Marketing suggested adopting modern appearance, reducing buttons, increasing positioning and voice recognition functions. From the perspective of technical function design, User Interface emphasized that the user should be the centre, reduce the buttons, focus on modifying the shape of the remote control, and do not waste the budget to design the universal remote controller. Industrial Designer had come up with the option of cheap and sustainable batteries, infrared lights and voice recognition technology. Industrial Designer also offered mouse-like scrolling and clicking functions, as well as specific remote control shapes.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay everybody is ready ? {vocalsound} Good morning again . So , today we are going to have a f second meeting . Oh Michael , hi .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:You're late . You have a good reason for that ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Very good {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today . {vocalsound} So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to {disfmarker} through the minutes of previous meeting . So uh {vocalsound} basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for {disfmarker} about that topics . I goin I'm going to share with you . {vocalsound} And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . You showed us {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:you ar you you prepare something for us ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager:The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Alright {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of {disfmarker} to give a name to the project . So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should {disfmarker} we could discuss quickly . Any ideas ?\nUser Interface:Uh the Powerstick .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Powerstick , yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What else ? What else ?\nMarketing:Uh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Maybe a Spanish name would work well .\nMarketing:Mm I was thinking of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish .\nMarketing:Mando .\nUser Interface:Mando .\nProject Manager:Mango ? Mango ?\nUser Interface:What is that ?\nMarketing:Mando .\nProject Manager:Mando . M_A_ ? M_A_ ?\nMarketing:A*_N_ yeah D_O .\nProject Manager:M_ D_O_ . Mm , okay .\nMarketing:It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me ,\nProject Manager:What does it mean ? Oh .\nMarketing:but maybe for a Spanish {disfmarker} for I {disfmarker} for {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What does it mean in Spanish ?\nMarketing:Control .\nUser Interface:Control .\nProject Manager:Hmm . Nice .\nUser Interface:Okay . 'Cause it also {disfmarker} like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} mm , yeah .\nUser Interface:so it might {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mando sounds Latino . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:The Mando .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So , let's go for Mando ? Yeah ? No objection ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah that's {gap} .\nProject Manager:Great . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , I think this is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:do you ? So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah they are the most T_V_ watcher . So we should be careful .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , I think this is more a question of of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Marketing .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} yeah\nProject Manager:I I think this is more a question of of look and feel .\nMarketing:it uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Something that should be addressed later We should we should go to other {disfmarker} for the other topics .\nMarketing:Yeah because if the product will be international {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well that's the thing . We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah okay , so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . So let's go for the three presentations right now . So , who want to start ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe maybe I should uh start . Yeah . Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay so I have your slides somewhere ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Should be in participant four .\nProject Manager:Participant four . {vocalsound} This one ?\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound} Uh .\nProject Manager:S that's coming . Uh {gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:okay . Great .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . And also I di I did a study with {disfmarker} for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been {disfmarker} have remained the same for the last five , ten years . There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . Sh next slide ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} more {disfmarker} most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . Also the people are worried about about the R*_S_I_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a {disfmarker} with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . They are also {vocalsound} {disfmarker} they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to {disfmarker} any beep any alarm or something incorporated to {disfmarker} with the remote control every time it it get lost .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:And also I found that young people {disfmarker} the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} in my opinion the Mando {disfmarker} this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like {disfmarker} the the liklier it is to get lost . Liklier or more likely ?\nUser Interface:More likely . {gap}\nMarketing:{gap} likely . Okay . Uh {vocalsound} people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but {vocalsound} they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . So it may be interesting to to think in a {disfmarker} in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .\nUser Interface:Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:cut out some {disfmarker} a lot of your market .\nMarketing:I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some {disfmarker} a a small fraction of of this remote controls .\nIndustrial Designer:Well maybe it could be a universal design .\nMarketing:Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands .\nUser Interface:Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ? That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but but {vocalsound} don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?\nMarketing:Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:The first and the third point , they are clashing .\nUser Interface:Well it can still be a {gap} , you can still extend past the hand .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nMarketing:Like uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then .\nUser Interface:Well it means {disfmarker} like , this remote here is kind of {disfmarker} is very thin and long so instead of having {disfmarker} you know you might have it kind of {disfmarker} a bit bigger\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah , like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Little sleek , longer ?\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:And it should fit the hand .\nMarketing:No no I was thinking of so like something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Something with the shape of the palm ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nMarketing:yeah .\nUser Interface:Some finger grips maybe .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything ,\nProject Manager:On the sides .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah . It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical .\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Not anymore . That's what {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:And then finally {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget would be large enough .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff because uh because {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But most of {disfmarker} yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh {vocalsound} to bring you to some new uh new informations . We had the new requirements from the {disfmarker} so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted {disfmarker} so they want to um {disfmarker} they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , I dunno if you had this information already . No ,\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations . Um they want also uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls .\nProject Manager:Excellent . So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally , {vocalsound} it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price if if we're {disfmarker} maybe I can get to this in my presentation though ,\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah . Sure sure .\nUser Interface:but um yeah .\nProject Manager:So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now .\nUser Interface:Yep . Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that {disfmarker} this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco\nUser Interface:Yeah . I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think {disfmarker} if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Sorry , what is your {gap} ?\nUser Interface:Uh participant three . You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so .\nMarketing:Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so {disfmarker} yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ {vocalsound} sound turns off . {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah uh channel fifty .\nIndustrial Designer:No it could be command control kind of thing .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . Means you say {disfmarker} you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Otherwise it's just lying idle .\nProject Manager:Okay Michael .\nUser Interface:Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe {gap} be easier to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nUser Interface:could I use the mouse , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm . Thanks . Okay .\nProject Manager:The wheel doesn't work .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Great {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really {disfmarker} it's by no means uh mm you know {vocalsound} on it's own in being so expensive . There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .\nProject Manager:{gap} Looks like a P_D_A_ {gap} ?\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah it doe it's {disfmarker} well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions {disfmarker} d different functions on the screen at different times . But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which I think is {disfmarker} it's a really kind of important design aspect um is {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} 'Cause the thing is what a {vocalsound} what we {disfmarker} the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel .\nIndustrial Designer:Change the channels .\nUser Interface:Now um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:uh the {disfmarker} I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . I usually use the up and down\nIndustrial Designer:Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh {disfmarker} it's annoying . So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:One possibility , if we {disfmarker} now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . So if you think about {disfmarker} it's kind of like a {disfmarker} you know in mobile phones now you don't use {disfmarker} you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So this would be pretty {disfmarker} kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . So , I mean there are {vocalsound} there are uh cheaper {disfmarker} this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . And {gap} was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .\nIndustrial Designer:But there is one problem {gap} then the user has to understand each of that functionality .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah well we w\nIndustrial Designer:Because the same button is doing too many things .\nUser Interface:Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I I would {disfmarker} if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:They don't really do anything . Maybe you know I {disfmarker} although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the {disfmarker} see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to {disfmarker} very different build {disfmarker} very different to the traditional {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It does sampling out of the {gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well I guess that depends on how you market it . If you {vocalsound} if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .\nMarketing:If y\nProject Manager:Okay , can you continue , please Mi ?\nUser Interface:So , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:yep . Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this {disfmarker} a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh {disfmarker} something that would be worth implementing . Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . I think even that ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:um but I think that would be quite useful as well . And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one {disfmarker} maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of {disfmarker} you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's {vocalsound} extensible to do other tasks . Say you have like um {vocalsound} a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you {disfmarker} also , selling the potential of the device . Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as {disfmarker} at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . Okay , thanks . {vocalsound} {gap} you want to go ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep . So {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:This one ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , it should be .\nProject Manager:Great . No , not that one . {gap} you are two .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nProject Manager:Alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing {disfmarker} doing some he is knowing about that technology . So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being {disfmarker} sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .\nProject Manager:Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right . So anyway , that didn't come into my mind ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so th that is a possibility . These could be other kind of interfaces .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . So spe buttons are something which is very {disfmarker} everybody is familiar with . So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking . Otherwise we are just like others in the market . So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That increases the the cost also .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh that's right . But uh means we have to see how much {disfmarker} what kind of microphones and stuff like that .\nProject Manager:Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well {disfmarker} of such technologies is enough ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc\nProject Manager:Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:That's right . No it it could be little d yeah it could be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So it could be s a few centimetres .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,\nIndustrial Designer:That's right . That's right .\nUser Interface:because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and {vocalsound} it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's right . Yeah .\nProject Manager:This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion .\nIndustrial Designer:So we can That's right . Yep .\nProject Manager:Okay , next . Uh that finished ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:No ?\nIndustrial Designer:No no . Components .\nProject Manager:Components ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So , will you go to the next slide ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yes sure .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . We are having a power button and the switch {vocalsound} , which is not much ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and then we are having the {gap} which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . And then there are two kind of things which can be {disfmarker} so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So we could not put that . So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So this is the easiest design the there could be . So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in {gap} . To have different technologies . So this was the {disfmarker} my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know {vocalsound} turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So these are the slight problems .\nProject Manager:So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?\nIndustrial Designer:Because {disfmarker} yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means {disfmarker} though I don't have much idea , but as he {disfmarker} the uh Marketing Expert presentation was {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo {vocalsound} everyone will s will buy it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Actually I'm not so sure\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So if we go with just the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:because I'm the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I'm sure .\nUser Interface:you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm {disfmarker} instead of pressing up on on a remote control . You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well it depends if it's a remote control th\nMarketing:it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that .\nUser Interface:Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nProject Manager:Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . We are targeting T_V_ . {vocalsound} We need {vocalsound} we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . Um we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing:With a good shape for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or good shape , yes . We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . Maybe this is something we can stick to it . And um {vocalsound} also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the {disfmarker} one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ {vocalsound} and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ {disfmarker} in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback {disfmarker} to to give some feedback informations about what we could have .\nUser Interface:Well it depends though {disfmarker} well it depends . If we we don't {disfmarker} unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of {disfmarker} something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . So that's an extra\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah that's right . Don don't you ha\nUser Interface:cost .\nProject Manager:don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or {gap} well systems that exist that we can use ?\nUser Interface:Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . Are we still {disfmarker} you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'Cause that really makes a big difference . 'Cause {vocalsound} even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . It's it's not really gonna {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's good point . What's what cou what could be the cost of uh {disfmarker} well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?\nUser Interface:For twenty five Euro ? {vocalsound} I think it's impossible .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not possible . It's impossible .\nUser Interface:But but I dunno ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that {disfmarker} any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:of increasing the unit price .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is {disfmarker} which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um {disfmarker} in terms to had {disfmarker} to have really an added value ?\nMarketing:What would be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nUser Interface:because {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Wha but what would be {disfmarker} one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?\nUser Interface:Well th\nMarketing:What what kind of information ?\nUser Interface:'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .\nMarketing:Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the\nProject Manager:They have tele teletext . Well , because they have teletext on it .\nMarketing:the n\nProject Manager:Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel .\nMarketing:Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays .\nProject Manager:They have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid {disfmarker} well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So to to uh\nUser Interface:You can get a lot more information on it .\nProject Manager:to browse more easily the teletext . For instance through uh through your remote control .\nMarketing:So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface:So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .\nProject Manager:The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh {disfmarker} o\nUser Interface:You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:so you can quickly just kind of {disfmarker} even without reading {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also .\nUser Interface:Well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . They may not have pictures , but maybe they do .\nIndustrial Designer:Are {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:There's {disfmarker} dependi it also depends on the country .\nProject Manager:Well because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for the same reason that we cannot uh {gap} informations on the T_V_ {gap} . We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there .\nUser Interface:No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well I I think if we're gonna {disfmarker} I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I dunno . We need to find that out .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} We need to close the meeting . Um {vocalsound} so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But {vocalsound} just a small thing ,\nProject Manager:Very quickly .\nIndustrial Designer:what kind of market we are targeting ? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or {disfmarker} because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:That is very important .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their {gap} ,\nUser Interface:If it's a really small T_V_ maybe {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Broke . Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:So this is {disfmarker} that we z that that we should target . So the com the um {vocalsound} the uh {vocalsound} the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It is up to you to go through this um {vocalsound} uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . So\nMarketing:I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the {disfmarker} than the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but not sure . Maybe it's cheaper , but we have no {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . You need a internet connection . You need m more things .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But\nUser Interface:Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop\nMarketing:for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . You just say channel fifty , and that's it .\nUser Interface:I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a {disfmarker} you know .\nMarketing:But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars ,\nIndustrial Designer:Means th yeah twenty five Euros is {disfmarker} yeah , that's right .\nUser Interface:Well this is what we need to find out .\nMarketing:it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 'Cause otherwise we need {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay this is {gap} {disfmarker} this is an open question for you . Yeah . This is uh up to you to tell us . But I'm definitely not keen on to to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:To move to another target ?\nProject Manager:no no no , I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . I'm not confident enough . I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work . I uh that work {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's real yeah . How to guarantee such performances is really hard .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:{gap} the expert uh said ninety five percent {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well this is still {disfmarker} is is very bad .\nUser Interface:Ninety five percent is not good enough though . {gap}\nProject Manager:So , this is the end of this discussion . Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . Um {vocalsound} so you have to work on the component uh concept .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . Okay . So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing . Um uh we {disfmarker} I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . Thanks . Bye .\nUser Interface:Yep .\n",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} Alright , yeah . {gap} crack on {gap} . Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . Um we were also going to use {gap} novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . Um that pretty much sums up the last one . So we'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh uh okay .\nProject Manager:Um uh the con today is the concep today .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um {disfmarker} Sorry about this . {gap} . And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , can we uh outsource these from elsewhere , um will we have to construct any items ourselves ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh I have a presentation {gap} I just saved it in the uh the folder .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then . Um {vocalsound} . Which one do y\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:Oh , interface concept ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's me .\nProject Manager:That's you . We've got trend watching , that's you .\nIndustrial Designer:It's uh {disfmarker} Components design .\nProject Manager:Components design .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh . The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . Uh but later on {gap} we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . So uh we decide what it's gonna be . Probably plastic . Uh we need the infra-red transmitter . Get that off the shelf . Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um {vocalsound} if you go on to the next slide . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you go on to f uh findings , it's like two or three slides down .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . So , this is what I found we can use . Uh three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one .\nProject Manager:Okay . Now ,\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nProject Manager:the kinetic one , we've {disfmarker} 'cause that's the ones where like you {disfmarker} the movement causes it .\nMarketing:Cost is {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?\nUser Interface:There's also a watch moves around a great deal more .\nProject Manager:Do you think ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:W\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I don't think it would . Um . And solar cells , I dunno about that .\nMarketing:{gap} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um , just like in usual remote controls .\nProject Manager:Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um . Yeah . Um . {vocalsound} And these are three different types of {disfmarker} or two different types {disfmarker} three different types of shapes you can have . Uh one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . Um {vocalsound} the materials are tha there as you can see , but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ?\nIndustrial Designer:uh which would be {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nMarketing:Is it not also it's expensive ?\nIndustrial Designer:and light . Uh , i think so as well , yeah .\nProject Manager:Um . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:They make mountain bikes out of that , don't they . So it's really light as well .\nProject Manager:Curious . Um , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um . {vocalsound} T yeah .\nProject Manager:Um could you maybe draw something ? I you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . Well for a curved , well I was thinking to {disfmarker} f for to sit in your {disfmarker} the palm of your hand . Uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe um an okay button around here , so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . Um I don't exactly {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Double curved . It probably means {disfmarker} this is probably double curved . Uh whereas a single curved would be like that . I guess . Or not necessarily .\nProject Manager:So it might literally just be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Two curves {gap} .\nProject Manager:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah like that . Whereas this is two curves . Um {vocalsound} so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Um which obviously {disfmarker} it looks better than the single curve , but uh you can't have it in titanium , which is uh a nice material . {vocalsound} Uh\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . So you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . Um {vocalsound} if you want the buttons to be {disfmarker} oh yeah , if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . But {vocalsound} you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . So um I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . Do you think ?\nProject Manager:Okay , that was definitely something we can talk about . Um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So , depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager:Um , do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ?\nMarketing:Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . Is that {disfmarker} did I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I think compared to say just pressing {gap} buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Advanced , like three eight six advance .\nProject Manager:{gap} if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay , sure .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:If I've not over-stepped . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah i\nProject Manager:Okay , um should I go on , or go back ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm , if we only have twelve Pounds fifty , twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ?\nProject Manager:Well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such . I assume .\nMarketing:Okay , that's good point .\nProject Manager:We have to look into the costs of those . So , sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . So that's just how the control works inside . Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Um . {gap} . So in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker} I think we can do it if {vocalsound} uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:Um I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . Um conventional battery would seem to make sense .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and I'm {disfmarker} I don't know about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? {gap} .\nUser Interface:Mm . Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:I also have a preference for rubber .\nProject Manager:Okay , well um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Based on my research .\nProject Manager:Yeah , well will we move on to user interface , and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:yeah ? Um sorry ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:as long as {disfmarker} were you ? Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep I'm finished .\nProject Manager:Um {gap} and d d d interface concept .\nUser Interface:Yep . Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh {vocalsound} and the white board\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time . Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if {vocalsound} so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . Um so uh next slide , if you please . Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um {vocalsound} v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f {vocalsound} and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um\nMarketing:{gap} digital .\nUser Interface:f f f {vocalsound} for di for digital or um or for {vocalsound} or for cable , whatever ,\nIndustrial Designer:Ah , okay .\nUser Interface:you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . And or um {gap} box . So it's not {vocalsound} I'm not really excessively concerned about that . You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right {vocalsound} left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . Um , so you\nProject Manager:Can I just jump in slightly there ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then .\nUser Interface:Yes , absolutely .\nProject Manager:{gap} okay .\nUser Interface:Um , basi {vocalsound} basically what I {vocalsound} basically what the {vocalsound} what {gap} be having um , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the L_C_ {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ and the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The joystick would be in the right place . And {vocalsound} also this is {gap} a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the {vocalsound} the um you know the whole thing you know {vocalsound} it should have sort of organic feel to it\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:that it should be , you know , soft to touch and can be moved around all nice . Um okay\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:on to {vocalsound} on to the next uh to the next slide .\nProject Manager:Um , yeah . Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , I guess .\nUser Interface:Yeah , 'kay basically um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I can add pretty pictures to this . The um {disfmarker} Assuming the hand {vocalsound} the hand to be in about sort of this position , um {gap} hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . Um and it would need t there would need to be a {disfmarker} it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . So . You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . You just have big {vocalsound} two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can {vocalsound} in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . Um , and that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Is this the joystick ?\nUser Interface:Th {vocalsound} this part here is the joystick . This would be the actual grip . Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:That would be probably the bulkiest part . And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . So it would fit just nicely in the hand . And again , this part could be rotated , so it can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . Um {disfmarker} So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . Um now programming it {vocalsound} actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . Programming them can be a right pain . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some {vocalsound} some fair iv {gap} fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you {disfmarker} on your {gap} computer just so that you could um pr {vocalsound} program it at a rather {vocalsound} in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . Um though you {disfmarker} i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a {vocalsound} ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . Um . But uh . Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:That's that's my idea .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Excellent , right . Um {vocalsound} uh .\nMarketing:Mm . 'Kay .\nProject Manager:File open .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We go .\nProject Manager:Trend watching .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} So uh to gather my research , two basic methods . We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , what's what's the new black ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:you know , as it goes . {vocalsound} Next slide please . Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know . {vocalsound} They want it to be {disfmarker} that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . Technology technical {disfmarker} technologically innovative . People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . So like the interface is really important . {vocalsound} And easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important {disfmarker} I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . People want it {disfmarker} I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , {gap} prefer it to have the newest features . And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . {vocalsound} The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . How that relates to a remote control I don't know .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But I I see {vocalsound} I come on to that in the next in the next slide . Spongy . I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . Well spongy's the new black as well . So we have the choice between rubber and plastic . If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then {disfmarker} can I skip the rest ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh yeah , I forgot to mention that . The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay , so\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Forgot to say that .\nMarketing:kinda spongy material .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So um so my personal opinion ? {vocalsound} Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , that's that's different , you know , that's {disfmarker} everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool . Like , titanium is cool but it's expensive . And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . Um {vocalsound} I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for {disfmarker} it's the up to the interface guy . So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . It could be something like , I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . So I think cool is the key . {vocalsound} Few questions about a spongy remote control . I've never seen one before . I've seen plastic remote controls . I think maybe they were {disfmarker} I don't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:sturdy , you know . For being strong and sturdy . So um if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know . I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . So how do things fit it ? And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus {gap} doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg . We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . People like spongy material . If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . And also , this was this year . So , things change all the time , every year you know they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . Well next year something else is gonna be the new black\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:'Kay . That's me .\nProject Manager:Well , um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . You always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . Um .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , so {disfmarker} I don't exactly what cost would be incurred . Um I can see your point about the number keypad , but I've {disfmarker} I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um {gap} boxes as well um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , actually {gap} if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau {vocalsound} {gap} it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . It's just irritating .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That's a good point .\nUser Interface:But if you h {vocalsound} but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:You can incorporate names into the menu . Okay .\nUser Interface:So you {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Even news , music . Like they do on uh sky digital kinda .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um {disfmarker} Looks like we {gap} going for a double curved design . Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . Though I'd have to say {vocalsound} depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I I would say definitely , I mean {vocalsound} I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? I can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ?\nUser Interface:Mm {gap} .\nProject Manager:That would be a worry of mine .\nIndustrial Designer:If you're going with the fruit and veg thing , {vocalsound} looks like a banana .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a {vocalsound} a structural weakness ,\nMarketing:{gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:F if you wanna design it that way . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , and I think would look rather co I mean {vocalsound} mi {vocalsound} rather cool . I mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice , it makes it {vocalsound} makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but uh .\nProject Manager:Yeah , we won't add that functionality .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . Course not .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:However , one interesting point is , I don't know how serious you were there , but we {disfmarker} if we take some of the ideas {gap} why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Sure , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:I dunno .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It's an {disfmarker} certainly a different colour from your average um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Make it harder to lose , as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's true . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sure .\nProject Manager:Was there anything in your research {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , {vocalsound} it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Y you know , you lose the monkey {disfmarker} the banana ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} monkey {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:y {vocalsound} you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana .\nUser Interface:I th uh I mean if it {disfmarker} I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default . Um .\nMarketing:S oh , I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know .\nUser Interface:Well basi {vocalsound} basically the um for {vocalsound} f for uh {disfmarker} I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic {vocalsound} will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:It's not simply a matter of frequency .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So um {vocalsound} usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi {vocalsound} you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and try the different codes that\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one .\nMarketing:That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's right .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .\nProject Manager:An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and then they maybe look up different names of um {vocalsound} different actual units that have been produced .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such .\nMarketing:Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ?\nUser Interface:Um booklet . {vocalsound} Some pages .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , so\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Doesn't have to be used very often\nMarketing:once every s\nProject Manager:that's right , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . But it's a but it's a nuisance .\nMarketing:and it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it , so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} If you {disfmarker} if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's {vocalsound} that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . Um mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay , this {disfmarker} {gap} just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . This is the conceptual one . Um . I think we've come up {disfmarker} I think we've covered everything we need to here . Um I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . Um {disfmarker} So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . Um looking from {vocalsound} {disfmarker} prototyping of some des description using clay . Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh {vocalsound} progress . Um {disfmarker} The user interface design , They're kind of {disfmarker} it looks they're {disfmarker} the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas {vocalsound} possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ?\nUser Interface:Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are {vocalsound} are made , I would say . Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , that's very true . {vocalsound} Um . Okay . Um got product evaluation as well . Um .\nMarketing:Yeah , you see I don't {disfmarker} some of these things kinda logically follow the others . How can {disfmarker} t product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I I think we'd be {disfmarker} yeah , no , it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with .\nMarketing:Oh , that's the {disfmarker} okay , sure sure sure .\nProject Manager:Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , sure . At this stage we still have no no target audience or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying\nMarketing:And it's stylish .\nProject Manager:if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Maybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device .\nMarketing:Yep . Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Think that's well within the normal bracket . Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . That one might have to be based on {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Programmable memory as well .\nIndustrial Designer:The U_S_B_ for which ?\nMarketing:For the remote control .\nProject Manager:The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right , okay .\nProject Manager:due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . Um .\nMarketing:We've w definitely talking some type of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , or are we gonna {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's just for T_V_ , but for\nMarketing:Different .\nProject Manager:programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:We don't know unless {disfmarker} it would make sense to .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nMarketing:But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something .\nUser Interface:I mean it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well something that doesn't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power .\nUser Interface:Yeah . The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha {vocalsound} it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um f {vocalsound} for one {vocalsound} for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be um o ought to be customisable and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Different languages , uh different skins and stuff like that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . W\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . That sort of thing .\nMarketing:Sure . {vocalsound} I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open {disfmarker} it is supposed to be international , right ? So .\nProject Manager:It would make sense to . I would say to .\nMarketing:It would make sense if you could {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well . We've already had the five minute warning ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:so . Um . I would say yeah . International would make sense . Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . {vocalsound} Uh we'll see how that goes . Um .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So um\nUser Interface:Where is the clay ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:do {disfmarker} I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .\nMarketing:The fruit and veg . This one .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Bu {vocalsound} but um but the spongy idea I like . I like it a lot .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I {gap} having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose .\nMarketing:Sure . I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , but we wanna keep the company brand as well ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:so .\nProject Manager:So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah . I was {vocalsound} like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button .\nProject Manager:Okay . And I think that says it all really .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think so too .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Sa\nProject Manager:See everybody in a half hour .\n",
        "summary": "After a brief review of the last meeting, Industrial Designer, User Interface and Marketing gave their presentations respectively on components, interface design and user requirements of the new remote control. Considering Marketing's advice and the budget, the team temporarily decided on a double-curved rubber remote control with an ergonomic joystick and an LCD screen menu display. Users could program their remote controls on the LCD screen as well as using software on the computer. Power would be supplied to the remote control by standard batteries. The beeping sound of the location function could be customized. Project Manager informed the team of the plan for the next meeting. Industrial Designer and User Interface would present a prototype of the remote control. The team would also make a product evaluation.",

So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So so so .\nUser Interface:Put on your mic .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So you forgot how this works again ?\nUser Interface:Boss .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Boss .\nMarketing:Maybe . Maybe maybe maybe .\nProject Manager:Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , 'kay ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:And here's the agenda for this meeting . Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . Looks cool . And then we're gonna evaluate it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Bra\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Then we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . And uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Hmm you knocked it up ?\nProject Manager:yep . And {vocalsound} we're gonna evaluate the product and close .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Got forty minutes to do this in . We should be fine . Let's try and keep this one on schedule .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Your thing is in {disfmarker} where is it ? Is it in {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Three , three .\nIndustrial Designer:Thi third third third . The end product thingy . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Who wants it ?\nUser Interface:Pedro can have it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nUser Interface:I'll help talk .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um yeah so what we ended up with . Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:someone forgot the {vocalsound} units there\nUser Interface:Unit price .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , uh unit price {disfmarker} unit production price cost thing . Um we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the {vocalsound} the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .\nProject Manager:Zapping your favourite channels , eh ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Scrolling through your favourites list .\nProject Manager:Oh okay okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Zapping you know zapping .\nProject Manager:Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing {vocalsound} . And um yeah that was the result .\nProject Manager:Ah 'kay . I like the the the the logo on there as well .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's very prominent {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:It is very prominent . So this is the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So {vocalsound} here I'll give you the {disfmarker} so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . Um so the scroll bar is {disfmarker} or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . This is the power button . Uh we have our um {vocalsound} we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? This is the teletext .\nIndustrial Designer:Start s the the start uh to to to\nUser Interface:The programme button ,\nIndustrial Designer:programme yeah .\nProject Manager:Ah , okay I see .\nUser Interface:yeah the programme button . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming {vocalsound} your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this {disfmarker} of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering .\nProject Manager:It's pretty cool .\nUser Interface:So you can see that when it lays like this or like this {disfmarker} and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is that {disfmarker} could that be easy to {disfmarker} for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Not helping {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it .\nUser Interface:Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . You can feel it .\nProject Manager:Mm . Feels good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah of course . Well this is clay {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah it's kinda cool . You have to reach a little bit don't you .\nUser Interface:Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit .\nProject Manager:Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} These {disfmarker} this is a bit larger than it would be , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's cool . I'm impressed .\nIndustrial Designer:Don't have no one to handle that .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And hold it so {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:wh what's the marketing perspective ?\nMarketing:oh that's {disfmarker} oh I like it . I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this . Yeah I think it's good . Good good good job .\nUser Interface:Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote .\nUser Interface:Beep beep beep .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh pla\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The locator function .\nMarketing:I'm ha\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:It's great . That's great . It's a great feature .\nUser Interface:Um beep beep beep {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm it's impressing .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Wicked isn't it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So let me get it ,\nUser Interface:so {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:if I press this button {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:beep beep beep {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I see . That's pretty cool . Hang on . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:beep beep beep {vocalsound} be shut up . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Beep beep beep {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I plan to do that as well .\nUser Interface:okay . Um no no no tha that's alri\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So the the two blue {disfmarker} are are those for the the it to charge off of {disfmarker} in ?\nUser Interface:Exactly that's exactly what those are for .\nProject Manager:Ah okay okay .\nUser Interface:And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um {disfmarker} you could\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:beep beep beep {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah {vocalsound} it's the right shape isn't it ?\nUser Interface:it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides {gap} .\nUser Interface:Right . So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh , I can see that .\nProject Manager:But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yep I like . Good job .\nProject Manager:So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No no .\nUser Interface:Oh no this is {vocalsound} just what we had to work with at the time .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .\nProject Manager:The {disfmarker} hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Careful .\nProject Manager:It came off . The scroll wheels , {gap} a problem with them not being sort of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore .\nMarketing:Well I mean of course , I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:You know some blend of silvers and blacks .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Beep beep beep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay enough of that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well i it's cool guys . 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ja .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Now now .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board .\nProject Manager:Have you ? Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ?\nMarketing:No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it .\nProject Manager:Oh I see I see .\nMarketing:I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and I think I've got this really strange cable . So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Nah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So what we had is we had the method . That's not how you spell method , is it ?\nUser Interface:No way .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No A_ {vocalsound} . {gap} . {vocalsound} So this doesn't go so fast this way . And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . And uh to me with this product we got uh {disfmarker} we got {vocalsound} basically three things to market . We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the {vocalsound} I I don't know what we would call the other part {disfmarker} what we call you know the the {vocalsound} the corp corporate {disfmarker} Help me . The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . So the features I think {vocalsound} we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability ,\nIndustrial Designer:It fell off .\nMarketing:we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um\nUser Interface:Beep beep beep .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . Uh and the corporation , we're talking about {disfmarker} we're we're a new we're a new company . We're wanting to make a name for ourself . We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of {disfmarker} the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? That was something I would be interested in . Um so {vocalsound} yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . Um w\nProject Manager:Do you {disfmarker} would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?\nMarketing:That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay .\nMarketing:But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh {disfmarker} there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c {vocalsound} one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my {disfmarker} but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back .\nProject Manager:And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s\nIndustrial Designer:We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . But uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . Uh to me the only additions {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less {disfmarker} b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm there's a risk of that .\nMarketing:Yep . But anyway that's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay so we can talk about finance now . So I have a little spreadsheet for us where {disfmarker} I I was wondering , you {disfmarker} when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ?\nUser Interface:Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . {vocalsound} Now\nUser Interface:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Very co very colf colourful .\nProject Manager:I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:Uh {vocalsound} and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:beep beep beep .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Can be made for {disfmarker} it sounded different that time {disfmarker} uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display ,\nUser Interface:Oh , sorry . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:uh an uh {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh do you think that's fair coming from a {disfmarker} m the manufacturing ?\nUser Interface:Yeah um I do think we that we we {vocalsound} uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print ,\nProject Manager:{gap} . Okay .\nUser Interface:so there may have been a m miscalculation in there .\nProject Manager:Yep . Okay . So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah .\nUser Interface:And we and we have a single-curved uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ?\nUser Interface:Uh I think that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . I don't know whether that {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:It's single-curved ,\nProject Manager:You think ? Okay\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:I'm {gap} convinced . But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? So we come {disfmarker} bring it down to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Fifteen point four .\nUser Interface:See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well hang on .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do don't speak so {disfmarker} it's in here , in that {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:w do we have any {disfmarker} we have special form don't we ?\nUser Interface:Yeah we do .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So that's {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Ah . What do you know {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:But the the the {disfmarker} we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh it's {vocalsound} a that's not very special , it's pretty {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} O okay so we're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} If th {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Push-button , scroll wheel , we're {disfmarker} basically we have uh th\nIndustrial Designer:We don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ?\nUser Interface:That's a scroll .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a scroll .\nProject Manager:Just a scroll ? It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ?\nUser Interface:Uh no we just use it as a scroll .\nMarketing:Ooh .\nProject Manager:Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros .\nUser Interface:It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It wasn't bad .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:We're wicked . Awesome .\nProject Manager:Okay so we're on to the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul {vocalsound} the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us {vocalsound} , and we can use that to tell {disfmarker} How's it going ? {vocalsound} Anyone got any thoughts ?\nUser Interface:What ?\nProject Manager:How how have we done today ?\nUser Interface:I think we did pretty well .\nProject Manager:I think we did pretty well too .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That looks pretty spectacular .\nMarketing:No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept .\nProject Manager:Any other chang uh thoughts ? Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Is it the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:That was mm-hmm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Sh I think there was plenty of room .\nProject Manager:I {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think we we ended up being quite creative there .\nUser Interface:We got a couple innovative i\nMarketing:Yeah\nUser Interface:Couple innovative ideas .\nMarketing:well we we we kinda broke {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us .\nProject Manager:Not every idea necessarily ,\nIndustrial Designer:Basically .\nProject Manager:it's still a remote control {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh no yeah but {disfmarker} we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but the uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But I like {disfmarker} I mean when I say we have we had {disfmarker} I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is {disfmarker} we did it .\nProject Manager:'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was\nProject Manager:I agree .\nIndustrial Designer:Teamwork .\nMarketing:Cohesive yeah .\nProject Manager:Synergy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} There was a lot of synergy .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yes synergistic yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Teamwork , yeah he is uh .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . Mm .\nUser Interface:These cables suck {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Yeah , this falls off\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and uh the white board worked really well without any pro\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:And that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:D you must have very long shirts . That's way far down lapel mic .\nProject Manager:Mm-mm , lapel . Wha okay , oh , alright {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Lapel lapel lapel {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Lapel .\nIndustrial Designer:That's almost a crotch {vocalsound} mi cr {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's it's down , it's quite close .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Keep it , keep it calm . {vocalsound} Oh dear {vocalsound} . No more pizza for me {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh dear oh dear {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause this is {disfmarker} you were using it o upside down . Still that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's our boss {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're {disfmarker} that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around ,\nIndustrial Designer:Use them like that .\nUser Interface:Pedro's right .\nProject Manager:but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down .\nUser Interface:Pedro's right .\nProject Manager:I don't care . Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . What new ideas have we found ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh wel\nMarketing:New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well let's do both then .\nMarketing:what are we ta\nProject Manager:Uh for the product ?\nUser Interface:Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature .\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:Yeah we came up with quite a bit .\nIndustrial Designer:Bunch of new ideas .\nProject Manager:And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice .\nProject Manager:Yeah less sore on the ears .\nMarketing:Well I I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , but {vocalsound} I don't think that's the that's avoidable .\nIndustrial Designer:Coulda been worse .\nProject Manager:Okay {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} Are the costs within the budget ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm n {vocalsound} no .\nProject Manager:Nope .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Oh hang on it really {disfmarker} that's something we {disfmarker} that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . No requirements are changed . We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . Is the project evaluated ? Mm I think so yeah , then celebration as it says .\nIndustrial Designer:Hooray .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Free coke provided at the cafeteria .\nProject Manager:Oh I don't know how that got there .\nUser Interface:All right .\nProject Manager:Uh anyway .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Who wrote that one ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Thank\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Thanks guys .\nMarketing:So we need to close this meeting ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:yeah bravo . Congratulations .\nUser Interface:Good job guys .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nMarketing:S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and {disfmarker} 'kay .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . Oh .\n",
        "summary": "The group mainly talked about the detailed design of the product at this meeting. First, the industrial designer introduced the function design of the product. It had not only some basic functions, but also the locator function and provided users with a revolutionary way of zapping. Later, the group went on to check the controller's paging ability and talked about more details on buttons. Next, the marketing expert mentioned three things making the product marketable and one possible drawback of the product. Besides, the marketing recommended making it upgradable but the project manager pointed out the risk of doing that. When evaluating the cost of the product, the group discussed some details of the components and made some adjustments. They finally got an estimate of fifteen point eight Euros, which was within the budget. In the end, they did some self-assessment and celebrated the completion of the project.",

        "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the\u00a0Children, Young People and Education committee this morning. We've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian and there is no substitute this morning. Can I ask if Members have got any declarations of interest they'd like to make, please? No? Okay. Thank you. Item 2 this morning, then, is a further session on our follow-up on our 'Mind over matter' report. I'm very pleased to welcome Carol Shillabeer, who is chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, and who manages the Together for Children and Young People programme. Thank you very much for attending, and thank you for the written update that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground that we want to cover this morning, so if it's okay we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start and ask you if you're satisfied with the progress that's been made since the programme was established in 2015.\nCarol Shillabeer:Thank you very much for that question, Chair. I've got to say 'yes', in many regards. So, the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services. We developed the windscreen model\u2014or we lifted the windscreen model. Other models that are very similar have been talked about as well, and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist CAMHS. It's some years ago now since this committee did the original report, and obviously Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Wales Audit Office had\u00a0done reports in the past, and I think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action. You'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas, and so therefore had to make a prioritisation. The prioritisation was at the specialist CAMHS end. We have provided the committee with a red, amber or green rating of where we feel that we were, and that was just before submission of the evidence. Overall I would say we have made progress. I recognise you recognise that in your 'Mind over matter' report, and that is pleasing. What I would say, though, is that there's a still a lot to be done. Certainly over the last nine months or so, we've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work, which we're not actually leading now as a programme, although we facilitated the workshop held in September. But that's got a real momentum, and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward, and I'm sure we will come on to that in more detail. But we know there is more community workforce in specialist CAMHS, we know we're seeing children in a shorter time frame, and we know we're accepting more referrals, so our indicators are telling us we are making progress.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. And you referred to the work on the whole-school approach, which is very welcome, and I recognise that the programme has been involved in driving that as well. But I'm sure you'll also recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health, and we feel very strongly that if any of the areas get out of balance, then it will jeopardise the progress in other parts of the programme. Are there any particular areas where you feel you haven't made enough progress that you'd like to draw the committee's attention to?\nCarol Shillabeer:This is maybe about what the programme's done, but really around the broader sense as well. I'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies. I'm disappointed that we haven't. I'm assured that we've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the Matrics Cymru framework developed for children and young people. I've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee, who have owned this, and we're working together more on this area. That's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas haven't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models, but that is an area we should have made, I think, earlier progress on. There's been a general reflection from myself and the Together for Children and Young People programme board over the phase of the programme. I think we started very strongly; I think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle, if I'm truthful about that\u2014we had a change of personnel, and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months, and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist CAMHS into that whole-school approach. But, if I could just agree with your comments about the whole system, it has to be the whole system and that's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical. If I can just say, in case I don't get a chance to say this later, I was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday, because what is clear is for that part, the early help and enhanced support, this isn't just about the NHS and it's not just about education, it's about every part of the system, really, which does make it more complex. But I just wanted to say that I think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it's needed and yesterday was a positive step.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on early help and enhanced support from Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. Good morning. In terms of local primary mental health support services, what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the Mental Health (Wales) Measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people, and how much of this is due to an increase in demand?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes, thanks very much. So, it's important to say, I think, at the outset, just by way of reminder, that the target, quite rightly, changed for children and young people. The target changed some years ago for adults, so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children. So, the services were working, a couple of years ago, with significant demand and then a change in the standard. I think you're absolutely right; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children, particularly within the 28 days. I would say\u2014. And we've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health Measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce, the staff, who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health, into a bit more of the secondary element, which is why the review being undertaken by the NHS delivery unit into primary care CAMHS is so critical, because, actually, if we don't have\u2014and I believe we don't have\u2014enough capacity in that part of the system, then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this. So, I think we will have seen, by the evidence submission, that demand has increased, not just in Wales but in the UK, and it has increased significantly. We are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand\u2014so, we have more contacts, more staff, shorter access times, so that is a good news story. We've not got it completely sustained at this stage, and therefore the focus of the delivery unit's primary care CAMHS report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. I know, from my own experience as a constituency AM, I have families who tell me that they can't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so\u2014they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's\u2014. And I don't like to put it in resource terms, but it's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family, but, obviously, in terms of cost as well. Do you find that that's a common theme across Wales?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes. I think that the thrust of that is absolutely right. So, we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that's why this is a whole system, not compartmentalised. I think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help\u2014hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist CAMHS, but can be supported, often by telephone, at that earlier stage. My sense of where we go next, in terms of, you know, you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle', as you referred to it in your report, is to make sure we've got a fully joined-up, multi-agency team approach to that. And I think that will need some resourcing to support that, yet to be fully determined. But yesterday's announcement about youth work, the Government's commitment to primary care, CAMHS, et cetera\u2014that's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist CAMHS. And just a final note on that, if I may\u2014at the beginning of the programme, we had a report from Hafal called 'Making Sense' and there were 10 key asks, if you like, of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service. They said, 'Please don't medicalise it'\u2014I'm paraphrasing now, of course\u2014'Please don't medicalise it; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then, when we really need help, please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level.' That's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme. So, that reflects the questions that you were asking, really.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. What are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support? And how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented? And also, given that the Together for Children and Young People programme comes to an end in October of this year, who, in your view, is best placed to forward this work stream, and what will be the biggest challenges? It's a bit of a long question, so, break it up however you like.\nCarol Shillabeer:That's absolutely fine.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:And what will be the biggest challenges that they will face?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes, I think that's helpfully laid out in three stages. So, you're absolutely right, there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support. It brought all of the agencies together, which was\u2014and actually had a bit of a waiting list, apparently, for places. So, there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this. In relation to the next steps, there is a planning group reflection in early July, in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop, and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage. One is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose. The second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area, and then, thirdly, to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps. So, that's the next stage of that. I'm pretty sure we'll come on shortly\u2014or hopefully\u2014to the potential of the regional partnership boards. There is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work. So, that will run alongside. But during the summer, then, we will be developing that framework approach, and we will be participating in the Association of Directors of Social Services conference in September, and then a follow-up workshop in October on this matter. On your question of 'Well, what happens after the programme?' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme. I'm pretty secure on the specialist CAMHS element. That will move, most likely, to the CAMHS network, which is part of the NHS mental health network. I actually chair the mental health network and that's one part of that. The whole-school approach element is already settled in Government and we've got a connection in to that. The question that's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go. I am currently in discussions with Welsh Government officials around that. I can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work. We cannot afford that we've come so far for this not now to proceed. I think there's a huge momentum behind this. I don't see there would be any obstacles\u2014I hope\u2014in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach, as we move forward. So, I'm not in a position to say, 'And the legacy arrangements will be\u2014', but I am in a position to say that I'm having those discussions with Welsh Government officials. They know my view that we've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward, and I believe that they are supportive of that.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Janet, I think those two questions have been touched on, the remaining questions. We are going to discuss in more detail the legacy arrangements, but if I could just ask on psychological therapies: you referred to the fact that you were a bit disappointed with progress in this area, and the area hasn't been directly led on by the Together for Children and Young People programme. Do you think that means now that there is more of a threat to progress in this area, because, you know, we've got different compartmentalising of actions, and this is absolutely key, isn't it, really?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes. I think there's\u2014. There is some refinement to be done, I think, in making sure the connections are there. So, I think, as we move to programme end, we'll want to be absolutely assured that there are no strands left hanging, so to speak. I am confident\u2014I mentioned the mental health network board that I chair\u2014that we have those strands nailed down, but recognising that the early help and enhanced support and the provision of psychological support is beyond the NHS. So, this will be an area that needs to be very much seen as a key part of that. My own sense is that\u2014. There's been quite a lot of other developments through the life of the programme. So, in the evidence that I've provided, you'll see the First 1000 days, all the adverse childhood experiences work, the Cymru Well Wales partnership, et cetera, et cetera. So, there is a bit of what I would call tidying up of the landscape to be done, and this is the ideal opportunity to do that.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on specialist CAMHS\u2014if I can just ask about the impact of the specialist CAMHS framework, and how effective you feel that has been in promoting a consistent delivery of care for young people.\nCarol Shillabeer:Thanks very much for that. Without wanting to go back too far in history, I remember coming into this area back in 2014 as I was asked to establish a CAMHS network. My observation was there wasn't really a strong and well-connected clinical community in this area. When we spin forward five years, I can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist CAMHS. The programme has helped; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour\u00a0to understand, actually, there is a good case for consistency in the main, with local variation. There has been a case for much greater learning between organisations. If I just give you an example\u2014you'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish. Some areas have them, but a lot of areas didn't. We do have inconsistency in that, but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across Wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes, which helps to prevent admissions and then, where there are admissions, helps to support people to be at home. They're all called slightly different things. So, I might have referred in my papers to CITT, CATT, COT and CITE. So, they've all got slightly different names and they've got slightly different opening hours. The key thrust of this is that there is a backbone, if you like, of a consistent approach with that local variation. We have to check. So, things like frameworks for improvement\u2014there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is. That then gets implemented, with some local variation. So, I think the process of moving in that way has been extremely helpful. There will be some variation. We want some variation, to some extent, as places try new things and evaluate new things. So, if I just refer to the previous question that I had, and I talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out; that's been tried in one area, been evaluated\u2014let's see the spread of that. So, you'll know my view on internet counselling, for example; I feel that is quite a strong offer for children\u2014not necessarily in the specialist end.\u00a0If that works in one area, why aren't we rolling that out to other areas? So, I think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together. It's in a stronger place\u2014a much stronger place\u2014than it was five years ago.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. You've referred to there being some inconsistencies in terms of crisis care, but are you able to assure the committee that all young people are now getting at least a consistent service, especially in terms of interventions in the instances of young people self-harming. Wherever you live in Wales, is that help there for you now?\nCarol Shillabeer:Well, in your work to produce the 'Mind over matter' report, I clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police. We've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist CAMHS umbrella, to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that. For example, is it that because the CIT, CAT, COT, CITE\u2014the community intensive service\u2014closes at 10 o'clock in a certain area, that actually it's after that that the network of support isn't as strong, and, if that is the case, what are we going to do about that? There's certainly potential in working more regionally or even working between adults' and children's in terms of the crisis resolution services that work beyond those hours. So, we are taking an extra look at this, because I could not be 100 per cent confident that, throughout the 24-hour period, we've got this fully settled. I continue to hear some stories from the police that they are picking up young people and feeling that they've not got that solid place to go, and we're following those through.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Hefin David on neurodevelopmental services.\nHefin David AM:I think, Chair, I should have declared an interest here, as my daughter has been diagnosed with autism and is currently going through the process of receiving neurodevelopmental speech and language support particularly. We're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, and that will increase further in the future. Can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children?\nCarol Shillabeer:Thank you. They're very big questions in terms of 'why'. I'm not sure that anyone really knows why, if I'm honest, although there is a lot of academic research going on. What we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through. So, in the information provided, I refer to the NHS digital prevalence report in England, which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder. Now, that sounds a bit shocking when we say that, but that's in the international classification scaling, and, of that, certainly, 2.5 per cent is around autism. I can just testify, in real life, that demand is absolutely growing. So, if I just take my own health board for a moment, we usually have about 75 referrals per year. Last year we had 300. So, that has felt very difficult to manage. If I can just give you a sense of what we've done so far and then what I think is next, I want to recognise the work of Dr Cath Norton and the steering group that's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme. They had a standing start. They've done a lot of very, very good work. We now have seven teams in place across Wales. We now have a national pathway. We now have a community-of-practice-type environment, and we're really getting into this. Good progress has been made. More people have been seen. More people have been assessed. So, we have made progress. But I've got a long list of considerations that I think respond to your question. One is that most referrals that come through, the clinicians tell me, are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support. So, that is often the reason why people come. Now, that is obviously going to be linked to\u00a0the whole-school approach and how we can support that. Demand is outstripping supply. So, our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up. So, if I just take my own example of 300 in the last year, we're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families, but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be. Because we've put these teams in, because we've got the new pathway, has that opened a gate and we've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern?\nHefin David AM:Can I just ask a question there?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes.\nHefin David AM:So, with regard to the 75 to 300 increase\u2014in the space of a year was that?\nCarol Shillabeer:In a year, yes.\nHefin David AM:Did you anticipate that or was that something that just came totally unexpected?\nCarol Shillabeer:I think we anticipated a few more, and just to say that in my\u2014\nHefin David AM:But not on that scale.\nCarol Shillabeer:No, not on that scale. And in my own health board\u2014I'm just referring to my own, and I'm happy to share the information on this\u2014we already had a service in place. So, it wasn't as if we had nothing in place previously. We had a NICE-compliant service already in place, but we knew we needed to expand that, which we have done, but we didn't anticipate 300. So, this is happening not just across Wales, actually, but across the UK\u2014so, this greater recognition, the desire for families coming forward to access that support and them seeing this as a route, which is really important. What I would also say, and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward, is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what I would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis\u2014so, a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support. So, we've got a lot of people who are under that threshold, but that's a lot of people who still need help and support. I'm trying to very fairly and, I hope, appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group\u2014the workstream under the programme. We've got to tackle all of that. It's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold, because there are needs elsewhere as well, and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support. Some of that overlaps with learning disability services. Can I just mention a few more things, as I'm on roll on neurodevelopmental?\nHefin David AM:It's up to the Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Yes, go on.\nCarol Shillabeer:Is that all right? Sorry, I know it's a very long answer. There is a concern from the neurodevelopmental group to get across that whilst there has been a lot of focus on autism\u2014and we recognise the private Member's Bill\u2014there are other neurodevelopmental presentations and there's a real\u2014. Having the broadest view would be advised by them, and I think they're particularly keen to understand what a future vision and what we call, say, a 'perfect world' would look like. That's the piece of work that we're wanting to do now. In terms of giving advice at the end of the programme and into legacy arrangements, about what the big, big things are, we are still needing to tackle.\nHefin David AM:I mean, I personally took a very personal decision when it came to the Member's Bill on autism you were talking about\u2014and that was the advice I received. You need to look at the wider symptoms that are presented beyond autism and other neurological conditions. So, I'm glad you said that, because it gives me\u2014. Because I didn't vote for that Bill, and I'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there. But what I do have concerns about is if the increase wasn't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the Together for Children and Young People programme has a duty to review capacity, after October who's going to make sure that that capacity's reviewed on a strategic basis?\nCarol Shillabeer:So, I should have probably added in that we've got a piece of work under way at the moment\u2014Welsh Government commissioned it\u2014by a person called Patrick Holton, and he is specifically looking at the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental. I think getting that slightly more independent view of what we think the trends are going to be over the long term will mean we can plan for the long term. We know that money's been put into this and it has had an important impact, but we now need to be planning for the next three, five, 10 and many years beyond that. There is the integrated autism service. I think there are some conversations, when I talk about the landscape being quite busy, about the sense of where this links as we support people through their lives with a neurodevelopmental issue. So, it's not just about a childhood thing; as people move through, we've got to get much better at that long-term planning. So, that piece of work is really important. We will get the report of that over the next couple of months in order for this sort of perfect-world picture that we want to try to describe to be informed by that. It also connects to the early help and enhanced support, because recognising if we just say half of the people who come for an assessment don't meet a threshold for a certain category, that's a lot of people who will need help and support to manage and cope with their condition and their situation.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. If we can just move on now to in-patient care, and if I can just ask you what the programme has been doing to address some of the challenges and opportunities we face in terms of CAMHS in-patient care, particularly in light of the restrictions that are in place in Abergele and T\u0177 Llidiard.\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes, thank you very much for that question. Again, quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients, and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units. I think, certainly, there is some recovery in the position in north Wales, and the programme did a peer review visit to north Wales, which I think was very helpful. In terms of where the programme has been on this issue, there is some work under way, at quite an advanced stage, around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services. This was quite a tricky thing to start off when you're in a position where, actually, there've been some restrictions, to then ask the service to think about going even further, but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce, get the right environment, et cetera, et cetera\u2014so, that piece of work, the review of the specification about what could be possible. Clearly, we work very closely with Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee as the commissioner, so we don't commission that. We neither performance manage those environments. But, if I can just say, probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children. We believe there would probably be about 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings. We haven't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams; we've got social care and we've got healthcare. There is a growing appetite to do something different. There is a meeting with the children's commissioner on 9 July to explore that. I've previously had conversations with the chief inspector of Care Inspectorate Wales, for example, and we have now got, I think, a consensus growing that we need to do something very different for children and young people who are in this sort of need for the future. We also know that there've been some high-profile legal cases as well. So, we've got to move to that step now. It has been largely successful, the work that has taken place over recent years, but not without its key challenges.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. And, just briefly on the new specification that WHSSC are developing, that will enable admissions at weekends and out of hours. How concerned should we be about that being a challenge, particularly in Abergele, where staffing has been a major issue?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes. I think we need to be very mindful of ensuring that the right workforce are in place before that gets implemented. The peer review highlighted the challenge of the physical environment, where the unit is, the challenge across north Wales of the workforce. These are issues well known by the health board, by the way, so it wasn't a surprise to them.\u00a0But that dialogue about how do we ensure that we've got the right workforce, because that unit, potentially, could\u2014you know, it's an isolated unit, and they\u2019ve been risk-managing. They've been managing the types of young people that they can take bearing in mind the workforce that they've got available, and that's been entirely the right thing to do. But the downside of that is it's not as accessible as we would want.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Hefin David has got some questions on workforce now.\nHefin David AM:Yes. With regard to the increased CAMHS posts that have been made available between 2016 and 2018\u2014a 62 per cent increase in CAMHS posts\u2014we know that there's likely to be labour market demand, high labour market demand, in those instances, so are the vacancy rates higher in Wales than elsewhere, given the increase in those posts to be filled?\nCarol Shillabeer:So, you're absolutely right. There's been quite a lot of investment, and there have been quite a lot of new recruits coming to the service. We had in the early days a situation where we were largely robbing Peter to pay Paul, to be quite frank. So, as new services were being developed, people would move from one part of the system to the other. So, in the early days there was little net gain. That has improved slightly, but we're in a national context, particularly around nursing and around some specialties in medicine, of a national shortage, so this is not a quick fix. We are starting to see a greater diversity of workforce. So, if I can mention psychology assistants, for example, my own health board is employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team, rather than going to where we might have been more traditionally based. We see some of that through the NHS benchmarking, particularly with England. They have more of that. We're perhaps a little bit\u2014\nHefin David AM:More of what?\nCarol Shillabeer:They have more skill mix in their workforce. We're catching up a bit more on that now.\nHefin David AM:Just to clarify there, what you're referring to\u2014there are more nursing and medical staff in the Wales system and more psychological staff, experts, in the UK picture. Is that\u2014?\nCarol Shillabeer:In the England picture. So, England had a programme called IAPT, which is about psychological therapies, and had therefore looked at the skill mix. Some of that was\u2014. We've chatted to colleagues in England, trying to learn\u2014we're all trying to make improvements in this area, of course; it's a UK and international issue\u2014what were their experiences of this psychological therapies approach. Because of their vacancies they had to skill mix, and because of the money that they had available\u2014they didn't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we've been able to secure. So, they skill mixed much earlier; we're skill mixing now. We're using different types of roles, for example. And if I can just make a plea, really, around recognising the input of the third sector\u2014so, it doesn't always have to be an NHS-employed person to work in service provision, direct front-line service provision, and the third sector are offering a significant contribution in a number of areas of our services. And that is one that we will need to cultivate, because, to be quite frank, our recruitment challenges won't be solved overnight. We've recognised that the commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals have gone up over recent times, but, with the training time, it's not a quick fix.\nHefin David AM:Does the workforce profile remain different, or are they starting to\u2014?\nCarol Shillabeer:They're starting to come together. There is a\u2014graph 13 in terms of the CAMHS profile. Each year we do the NHS benchmarking, and we can see where we are compared to others, and I would expect over the next year or two that we see a bit more narrowing.\nHefin David AM:So, if you compare a child in Wales with a child in England in the last two years who's been through this, would they have had a different experience as a result, and different clinical advice as a result, or is there consistency despite the difference in workforce profile?\nCarol Shillabeer:That's quite a big question. Hand on heart, could I tell you I absolutely know the detail of that? No, I couldn't.\u00a0The practice in this area is guided by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance, so it's pretty much guided. We would expect all of our practitioners to be able to work to NICE guidance. When you skill mix a team, you enable the right referrals to go to the right person, so you wouldn't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs\u2014well, you would match them to the right practitioner for their needs. So, it does\u2014. And we've seen some of that; if I just make reference to the panel approach in Gwent that's been developed, a multi-agency panel come together, a referral comes in, it's then about matching the right service and the right person to the needs that are being presented. So, we can be much more flexible in relation to that, and we have to be careful to use the right resource for the right person, because, if we've got a resource that is highly specialist, we want them to be dealing with those children and young people.\nHefin David AM:And one of the things you're able to do\u2014because there's a lot about the labour market you can't control, but one of the things you can control is workforce development and ongoing workforce development. You've mentioned communities of practice. What other things are being done in addition, and how do the communities of practice work might be a good question, but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that is presented to you?\nCarol Shillabeer:Thank you for that. So, there's a couple of things around\u2014. I think there's a huge focus on staff retention now, not just in Wales but across the UK. So, we've got recruitment but we've got retention. What are the factors that affect retention? Actually, well-being, well-being at work\u2014and you'll know that within 'A Healthier Wales' the focus on staff engagement, staff well-being, has been laid out\u2014the ability to work well in teams and the culture of organisations and services, and, then, as you rightly say, training and development and career opportunities. So, the developments over the last few years have brought training opportunities and career development opportunities as well. I think the community of practice\u2014it's something that has become a bit of a standard now across these areas\u2014actually brings people together doing collective audit, doing collective reflection on service improvement, and being very clear about learning from one another. And, if you're a clinician, that gives you a lot of motivation to keep driving forward. So, I think we have the fundamental building blocks in place, but there is more to do around the environment in which our practitioners and our staff operate.\nHefin David AM:What about the Welsh language in the health board?\nCarol Shillabeer:Thank you very much. There are two elements, if I may, just on that. In your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the Welsh language, and have we got enough Welsh language practitioners where we need them. We are doing that piece of work. I'm pleased to say that, over the last few years, I think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of Welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their Welsh-speaking communities are. We're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient CAMHS and community intensive services, because, particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable, they would choose the language they wish to choose. So, we know we need to respond to that. So, we will be in a position to, by the end of this programme, provide that position statement on what happens next. I would also say, of course, we've got the Welsh language standards that we are all working on at the moment, and we've got a very clear programme of when we have to be compliant with those standards. So, that element is very high on the priority list.\nHefin David AM:Okay.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Suzy Davies has a question about looked-after children.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes. Thank you, Chair. Obviously, everything you've been speaking about already, particularly about workforce development, applies to children in care as well, where there's other work also going on in terms of support. Can you give us some indication about how the programme intersects, then, with the outcomes for the children in care work programme?\nCarol Shillabeer:Thanks very much for that. So, we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group, which is good. So, we've got that cross-link. We also have a director of social services on our programme board and, obviously, they're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children. I just made reference to, under the question on specialist CAMHS in-patients, the need to bring those services together, and that, really, is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the Together for Children and Young People programme and the constituent parts. So, I'm confident that that has been pegged now. We've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that.\nSuzy Davies AM:Can you just perhaps give us an example of how that then looks on the ground? Because it's great that people are talking together, but how would that affect, I don't know, individual members of the workforce, or, indeed, the children we're talking about?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes. So, if I just give an example of a unit in south Wales that is a social care unit, we've been having discussions about, 'Well, actually, shouldn't you have a psychologist and good access to psychological therapies, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?' So, we haven't yet got an agreed position on how we're going to do this, but the position is that something needs to be done, and there is an appetite for and an understanding of the case for change, I believe. But what it will mean, I think, in practice, is that you get much more fluid roles moving across sectors, or we could be designing services that are fully integrated. Now, there may be challenges in that, but, you know, let's get them out on the table. So, in terms of this seamless health and social care system for Wales, this is one of the tests of that, I would say: can we, within the next five years, 10 years, really bring that together? That will take quite a lot of work and commitment.  On the looked-after children specifically, we have picked that up, particularly following your previous report, looking specifically at the assessment of young people who are care experienced who are in the system. Absolutely, part of the health assessment is emotional health and mental health. We are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be, particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances. That's a core piece of work under the early help and enhanced support work stream, and we'll be ensuring that that is complete by the end of the programme.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. And you're confident that that will reach children who are being fostered and perhaps don't have very frequent looked-after children reviews, because, from all other perspectives, things are going fairly well.\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes. And, of course, there's the edge-of-care work that the Government have been supporting, and, certainly in my own area, under the regional partnership board, we have a Start Well programme, which is the old Children and Young People's Partnership programme, where there's a significant investment in supporting children and young people, families, on the edge of care, which does pick up fostering.\nSuzy Davies AM:Ah, lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Dawn has a question on transition.\nDawn Bowden AM:Yes. Thank you, Chair. We've heard, not necessarily just in the context of this report, because we've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention, and I've in fact only recently\u2014well, just this week, actually\u2014met with community mental health teams in my constituency, and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services. Now, I know we had the\u2014. The transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now, and the programme was involved in developing that guidance. But what's your assessment of the impact that it's had? Because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps, aren't we?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes, thank you for that. You're absolutely right; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that. And, in particular, I know that the children's commissioner is very focused on transition, not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support, but children in paediatric wards, and there is a working group with Welsh Government looking at this.  The children's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say, 'Well, if this works, this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere'. But the big question there is 'if'. So, we do want to get evaluation. If I were just to give an estimate of where I think this will land, I think it will have made improvements, but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing, supporting, auditing that every child is supported in line with that guidance. So, I talked about community practice and clinical audit: is this something that we make, then, a mandatory audit, each year, that we do that double check?\u00a0Because it's one of those things where we know when a child is 14, 15, 16, 17, so what's stopping us? If indeed the evaluation says it's not happening everywhere, it's not happening early enough, what is stopping us? We really need to get underneath that. So, my sense will be it will show us, it will be better, but there's some further work to do, and following that up in terms of audit and making sure that we've got a systematic approach to dealing with those who haven't had the guidance fully implemented, because it can make a real difference.\nDawn Bowden AM:Yes, and it seems to me\u2014you've just talked about having a systematic approach, and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process, isn't it? So, it shouldn't be difficult. I know we're talking about in the health service things shouldn't be difficult and they are, and one of the gripes\u2014I had a meeting with the community health team\u2014was the problems of the new IT systems and so on\u2014let's not go there at the moment. But, really, this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services. It shouldn't be difficult. It's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult.\nCarol Shillabeer:Can I add one other dimension in, which I think is going to be quite interesting? We talk about transitions being an issue\u2014and we know it's not just in mental health, but it's elsewhere\u2014then you start to think, 'What if we could reduce transitions?', so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better. We are doing a piece of work with Government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be. We know that in different places they have approached that\u2014in Australia and places in the UK. There are probably some pros and cons, but should we be moving to a 0-25. That is moving the transition at the age of 25, but at least it's not at the eighteenth birthday. What's the argument around what adolescent, young people and young adults services are, for example? That piece of research and understanding\u2014\nDawn Bowden AM:You could probably have a gradual transition, then, couldn't you?\nCarol Shillabeer:Quite potentially. I've got some people who have joined my own health board who've worked in that 0-25-type service, and we're catching up\u2014'Tell me what was good about it? Tell me what was not so good about it? What did the young people themselves think about that?'. Because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions, there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right, then.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. We've got some really important questions now about legacy, because throughout the session this morning you've referred to ongoing work, really, and that is a major concern for the committee. Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, thank you, Chair, we are a little bit worried that this programme is coming to an end in a matter of months when perhaps its work's not been completed. Obviously, we've got the Welsh Government's strategy for mental health running until 2022, which is a few years longer. Can you tell me whether you think your programme needs to continue, perhaps even if it's just for the same length of time as Together for Mental Health, or is its work done and it needs to be picked up now by a different system?\nCarol Shillabeer:Thank you for that. Can I just say, I've given this so much thought over the time, because I think you might have asked me this question when I came previously? There are two ways to look at this. I'm absolutely sure that the issue of children's emotional and mental health will be one that will be with us for a very long time. We have made a lot of progress, I think, as a society, in talking about this now. We talk about mental health so much more than we ever used to. When I was a child, we never talked about it. I talk to my own children and say, 'What's going on in your lives at school?', and they talk about this. This is not an issue, if you like, that I believe you can pick up and solve literally in five years. This is one for the long term for us. So, on the one hand, I think my view last year was that, when you have a programme of work, you should have a start, a middle and end, really\u2014otherwise it's not a programme of work, it's almost forever\u2014and there is a moment to refresh and reflect on whether that mechanism has done all it should and it should move into a different mechanism. So, my position last year was, 'This will have been running for five years\u2014we've done a lot of work and made progress on specialist CAMHS, we have made progress on the whole-school approach and there is a different mechanism for this' et cetera. My position now is I want to just be really sure and secure that there is a strong arrangement going forward that takes this work, if this programme is going to close.\nSuzy Davies AM:Are you sure?\nCarol Shillabeer:Not yet. So, I think, in an earlier question I indicated dialogue going on between myself and Welsh Government officials. I don't think there's a barrier\u2014people aren't saying, 'No, it all needs to just stop; we've solved the issue', but the exact nature of the legacy arrangements, particularly for early help and enhanced support, are not yet fully determined, or for neurodevelopmental. If it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme, I would be supporting continuing the programme. I don't think we can stop now.\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, I don't think any of us would disagree with that, but I suppose there might be a level of concern that the Welsh Government's preferred route from now on would be through the regional partnership boards and public services boards. You mentioned that you've done that work in Gwent, down in the south-east of your patch there. It's quite difficult for us to try and get a picture of how that will work successfully for the whole of Wales. I know you've got your experience in Gwent, but have you thought a bit more about how it might look elsewhere, if that's the route that Government decides to pursue?\nCarol Shillabeer:Yes. I think the key question in my own mind is: are the regional partnership boards yet ready and mature enough to take this forward? I'm the chair of the Powys regional partnership board, so I should declare that. There's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards at the moment\u2014\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, we'll be asking them to go with the 'Mind over matter' report, to make sure that that's delivered upon.\nCarol Shillabeer:There's a lot, you know, 'A Healthier Wales'\u2014. Everyone does feel that the regional partnership boards are a route to really secure multi-agency working, so there is quite a high expectation. My understanding\u2014and this is a rather informal understanding\u2014is that different RPBs are in different places. So, some have retained what used to be the old children and young people partnerships, and perhaps where they have been retained, they may be in a more progressed position. Some are looking to have to re-establish those. So, my sense of this is that, I think, possibly the RPBs aren't yet in that position to be ready. Our piece of work on early help and enhanced support, in terms of your earlier question about what's the commitment\u2014that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months of development work, alongside the RPB development work, to get that ready, before we can then more confidently say where we can hand over.\nSuzy Davies AM:You may not feel able to say it, then, but would be wrong in saying that, actually, it would be quite a good idea to extend the current programme, just to make sure that anyone else who might be able to run on with component parts of it is in the position to do that to our satisfaction?\nCarol Shillabeer:I'm happy to respond to it. My sense is that, whether it's the programme or whether it's something else, something needs to be there. The next stage is really multi-agency, so it may well be that the programme currently has been NHS-led\u2014maybe it needs to be led elsewhere, maybe not. I think there's a view that this needs to continue. I'm less wedded to it having to be the Together for Children and Young People programme. It may be seen as a convenient mechanism\u2014it's already established, we've got a programme team et cetera, so it may be seen as a ready sort of solution. I'm not wedded to that. What I feel strongly about is that we've got to have the right mechanism to take it forward.\nSuzy Davies AM:Can I just push you on one thing there? You mentioned, perhaps, the NHS could lead on the work, for example. Is there a risk of fragmentation if we start looking\u2014? I'm just thinking\u2014I mean, we've got the elements here: we've got the NHS, there's the whole-school approach, early help and enhanced support and intervention, as you mentioned earlier. If that goes to one of the players in that multi-agency approach, is there a risk that they might become too dominant, inadvertently\u2014?\nCarol Shillabeer:If I can just clarify\u2014apologies if I wasn't clear. I said the current programme has been NHS-led, and that might be a reason to change.\nSuzy Davies AM:To mix it up a bit. Oh, right, okay. Anything else you want me to pursue on that\u2014?\nLynne Neagle AM:Can I just clarify for the record, Carol\u2014because we put this to the Minister last week\u2014are you looking at asking the regional partnership boards to take this work over from October 2019? Are you saying clearly to the committee that you do not feel that all regional partnership boards are ready for that challenge at this point?\nCarol Shillabeer:I'm saying that on a more, if you like it, uniformed and informal basis, we're doing some work with the children's commissioner now in terms of\u2014. I know the children's commissioner's very interested in how RPBs are managing, developing and dealing with the issues of children and young people's concerns. We're working with her to understand and to mirror alongside her the understanding of the RPBs. What I would say is that there has been some preparatory work by Government around supporting RPBs. So, for example, in the integrated care fund guidance last year, there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health, which I welcomed. I've also welcomed, literally last week, a letter to all RPB chairs giving an allocation of \u00a3200,000 per RPB to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element. So, all of these things are in the right direction. My sense, and I need to stress it's a sense because we haven't done that piece of work, is different RPBs are in different places. So, how confident can we be at the October date that we could hand over? My sense is, just to safeguard, having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable, and that's what I'm talking to officials about.\nLynne Neagle AM:And that would either be an extension of the Together for Children and Young People programme or something else. Okay, thank you.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you. Because I think there is a question, isn't there, about whether the RPBs will make this enough of a priority? I'm a bit nervous that it might get lost in that huge amount of work you said they might have. Just a final question from me: how are you establishing what the young people themselves think about the end of the programme? Are they bothered about the structure of this at all or are they just concerned that they're getting help? How's the stakeholder group feeding into this?\nCarol Shillabeer:I've not been blown over in the rush of people saying, 'Don't go anywhere.' [Laughter.] It's a really important matter for young people. I know that later on you're meeting with the Youth Parliament, you're having a joint session, which is fantastic. We've had contact with the Youth Parliament because we know it's one of their top three issues. So, it runs in the vein of that this is going to be a long-term matter for young people, I think. Whether they have a specific view on the programme, I don't know. I've not heard that. But I'm pretty sure they will be vocal in saying, 'We have to have these developments continue.'\u00a0It is a major issue, we're not there yet\u2014maybe some progress has been made but there's still a lot to do\u2014and I think we'll need to be able to respond to that.\nSuzy Davies AM:Anything particularly you want in addition to that?\nLynne Neagle AM:No, I think that's fine. And if I can just say that it was really great last week at the early help and enhanced day to see young people so central to the day all the way through. It was very, very important and very welcome.\nSuzy Davies AM:Carol, thank you for that. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. we have come to the end of our time. We had a lot of things that we wanted to cover with you. We might need to drop you a line about a couple of things that we haven't covered, but can I thank you for your attendance this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time.\nCarol Shillabeer:Thank you, all.\nLynne Neagle AM:Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Welsh Youth Parliament\u2014invitation to engagement events. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Education clarifying some issues around the Welsh network of healthy schools scheme, following the task and finish group. Paper to note 3: letter from the Minister for Education on the implementation of the Diamond reforms, and that's ahead of our session on 4 July. Papers to note 4 and 5 are a letter from me to the children's commissioner and the Minister for Education seeking the update we agreed on the issue of elective home education. And then paper to note 6, paper to note 7 and paper to note 8 are all letters regarding the concerns that we discussed about the expectation of a target being set for looked-after children, to the First Minister, Children's Commissioner for Wales and the Association of Directors of Social Services. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you very much. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Okay.\n",
        "summary": "This was the Children, Young People and Education committee, guided by Lynne Neagle. The whole meeting was in the quiz form, in which Carol Shillabeer, the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, answered questions about the Together for Children and Young People programme. To begin with, Shillabeer responded to the progress and shortages of the whole programme, followed by the theme of early help and enhanced support for children and young people. The next topic was the CAMHS framework and its effect in promoting a consistent delivery of care. Furthermore, Shillabeer answered questions about neurodevelopmental services, in-patient care, the workforce issue, looked-after children, and transitional arrangement. In the end, Shillabeer indicated the personal position of legacy that there would be something to handle those problems, no matter what it was.",

You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um {vocalsound} th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I wanna change that {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:I don't know if that's really {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I I gotta I gotta flashlight , and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:You shake it .\nMarketing:yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Like this {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy ,\nMarketing:And that's on the camera {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Uh we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night {vocalsound} which doesn't make a lot of sense .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea .\nProject Manager:Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ?\nUser Interface:M battery versus cradle I think is {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I like the kinetic .\nProject Manager:So we have battery versus cradle {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I g I I figured you would . Yes . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:It could be fun {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:you could {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well it is it is more uh {disfmarker} I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . So um\nProject Manager:Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface:our case design . We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh {disfmarker} Yeah pers\nProject Manager:Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it .\nUser Interface:I think wood i {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It it it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Nah .\nUser Interface:I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know .\nMarketing:Uh .\nProject Manager:Okay . Hmm .\nMarketing:Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever {disfmarker} whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some {disfmarker} a couple of these . Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a {disfmarker} to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Do you get a good grip on the rubber ? Yeah okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:You don't even need to lean down to get it .\nUser Interface:The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is {disfmarker} w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . So um {disfmarker} and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:But basically these are {vocalsound} curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their um {vocalsound} in their {vocalsound} message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . I have no idea exactly what they're talking about ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:but that's what they told me , {vocalsound} uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:or surfaces . I have no idea .\nProject Manager:I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm yeah that's {disfmarker} yeah that's what I see .\nProject Manager:yeah that's what {gap} .\nUser Interface:Oh okay oh like a wave , okay .\nMarketing:Yeah that's what I see also .\nUser Interface:Alright that makes sense okay . Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display ,\nMarketing:Ooh .\nUser Interface:or multiple scrolling wheels . Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh {disfmarker} has at his disposal to put together a user interface .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:For electronics , we have these very technical um {vocalsound} descriptions here . A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:a regular chip , which is {vocalsound} like the medium porridge {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} medium expense uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ?\nUser Interface:Yes the difference is , with a simple chip {disfmarker} a simple chip will operate {disfmarker} oh why doesn't this scroll up ? Previous previous , okay . A simple chip is required to operate push buttons .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So but yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah that makes sense . So presentation from {disfmarker} I guess design would go best . Next .\nUser Interface:That's the end of my presentation .\nProject Manager:Technical functions or interface concept ?\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh interface concept .\nProject Manager:Yeah that's it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Very long presentation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , but it has your name on it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . Um so , somehow that thing's too big , but um {disfmarker} okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so .\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No . It it it {disfmarker} you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:If the T_V_ is working , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's just {disfmarker} I mean it'll {disfmarker} if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore ,\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep .\nProject Manager:But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? So if you pressed it and went , up ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That kinda would r d\nUser Interface:Well then why don't you just press the up button ?\nProject Manager:Man yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . That would kind of lose it .\nProject Manager:But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go {disfmarker} Up .\nUser Interface:Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ .\nMarketing:That's right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:It might not be it might not be completely confusing , but I think you'll still y it's still {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I don't think it's practical at all . I think it's a bad idea frankly .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah so um taking that away , our uh {disfmarker} the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You guys know your stuff .\nIndustrial Designer:it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . Um as for the point that we making about losing it . Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost ,\nUser Interface:That I would believe .\nIndustrial Designer:about {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow . Um so {vocalsound} the the {disfmarker} what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without {disfmarker} with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext .\nProject Manager:So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?\nIndustrial Designer:Ye no it's not\nUser Interface:That's not a scroll wheel .\nIndustrial Designer:i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross ,\nProject Manager:Nah . Oh okay okay . I see .\nIndustrial Designer:so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that {gap} alone .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Uh , okay .\nUser Interface:Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and uh is not too prone to get lost . That be it .\nProject Manager:'Kay . So on to {disfmarker} Y functional requirements or trend watching ?\nMarketing:I dunno .\nUser Interface:Trend watching has a later date there .\nMarketing:Trend watching I guess . Trend watching I believe .\nProject Manager:{gap} forty six nineteen fifty seven . Yep .\nMarketing:See what it looks like . It's been so long .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing:Well {vocalsound} I don't know what to say . When I s when I see the {disfmarker} when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . I see so many of 'em out there . There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there .\nUser Interface:Are you talking about the picture ? That's not our that's not our b design ,\nMarketing:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:that's just a {disfmarker} that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay . Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . That's what I understand so ,\nProject Manager:Upper management said yes .\nMarketing:hello .\nProject Manager:Uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam .\nMarketing:And and so {disfmarker} yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin {vocalsound} there are so many people making these products at this price right now . What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ?\nUser Interface:What's special and unique about a scroll ?\nMarketing:Uh {vocalsound} well I don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's cool .\nMarketing:yeah it's {disfmarker} I I just see it as different . I don't say it's specially mm {disfmarker} I don't say it's special . Uh I say that it's different I {disfmarker} what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . I need something to market about this thing . We're we're a new firm .\nProject Manager:I'd I'd say though that we {disfmarker} if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well ,\nMarketing:What i {vocalsound} if when when we have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but wi with a similar {disfmarker}\nMarketing:yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's {disfmarker} as as a marketing standard {disfmarker} I need something to market , to make this product unique .\nUser Interface:Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the {disfmarker} having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior ,\nMarketing:Yep .\nUser Interface:having it look really nice um and also be really durable .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here .\nProject Manager:Mm . Course .\nUser Interface:Right yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase .\nProject Manager:Yeah 'cause that's {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:So I need a product .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:Well let's get a product then .\nMarketing:I need a product to market . And I just {disfmarker} whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . Tha that I'm not concerned with .\nProject Manager:So now {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If you if you give me {disfmarker} if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost .\nProject Manager:So our big {vocalsound} questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ? Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?\nUser Interface:Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? Function-wise , what does that do that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh but that was in your presentation {vocalsound} so wh what would you imagine it doing ?\nMarketing:Yeah wh wh what's the {vocalsound} wh\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm 'kay\nIndustrial Designer:But would we {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co {vocalsound} it's a very competitive market .\nProject Manager:What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So I d\nUser Interface:Th they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , I mean , it {disfmarker} I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know {disfmarker} if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use {disfmarker} if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . I don't think volume {disfmarker} or do you think volume would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno . I'll bet first in volume maybe . I dunno .\nUser Interface:No we can {disfmarker} we can do multiple scroll wheels but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the {vocalsound} uh dock to put it in {disfmarker} to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It s i m makes it easy to market ,\nMarketing:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so .\nMarketing:I think it's {disfmarker} that's right . I think so .\nProject Manager:And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yep . I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness .\nProject Manager:So our big decision then is like how do we do um like {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh {disfmarker} What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'm thinking {disfmarker} yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there's {disfmarker} you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused {disfmarker} the plastic with rubber on the outside .\nProject Manager:Okay . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . So then if we {vocalsound} {disfmarker} d d do we want to do anything more basic with the {disfmarker} uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for {vocalsound} um buttons , or do we want {disfmarker} if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? Do we want to give {disfmarker} do we want to have anything else on it ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's only a T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing {disfmarker} I mean it's {disfmarker} you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you {vocalsound} just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:It receives no information .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:So I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah right now there's {disfmarker} right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the {disfmarker} a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:I don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either . Don't see it .\nProject Manager:Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on {disfmarker} well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What what overall things have we not decided on ?\nUser Interface:Well we have to {disfmarker} I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? What do you guys like in the user interface ?\nProject Manager:I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Again . Well I think it's it's {disfmarker} the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . It's just another {disfmarker} it's just a an idea , and I don't know {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because {vocalsound} I think , as far as durability th it's not a big {disfmarker} well maybe when it's closed .\nMarketing:I mean what I see {disfmarker} one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , {vocalsound} their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:This {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:And what I keep throwing out there {disfmarker} I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost .\nProject Manager:Yeah and I guess th th the question th {vocalsound} th that you're being asked right now is whether {disfmarker} is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ?\nMarketing:Oh okay\nProject Manager:Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost .\nMarketing:phew .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features ,\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost .\nUser Interface:The {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ?\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine .\nIndustrial Designer:No it's just different .\nUser Interface:But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna .\nMarketing:Integrated , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it's just uh I I think that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It should be a really simple signal though so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control .\nProject Manager:And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep .\nUser Interface:That's true yeah .\nProject Manager:But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh yeah yeah . It'll be really cheap .\nMarketing:Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe not {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Makes your living room more fresh as you watch {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay we're doing well for time here .\nIndustrial Designer:S\nProject Manager:Um we've got about another ten minutes . I think that uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So the scroll wheel , in or out ?\nProject Manager:Mm pr my personal preference is out . I don't think the cost is justified {vocalsound} for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah I think we have {disfmarker} like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause it's it it breaks down easier .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that .\nProject Manager:But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_\nMarketing:W\nProject Manager:because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Sure .\nProject Manager:if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh I see I see . That's where you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Ah I see I see what you're talking about now . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's just {disfmarker} it's basically {disfmarker} it it's just a f look and feel thing . It has the same exact functionality as two buttons .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I I think there's {disfmarker} you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing {disfmarker} are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing .\nProject Manager:Yeah if you're just sitting there going {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Instead of going button-to-bu you just {vocalsound} j you'd j j j j j j .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:That's kinda cool actually .\nMarketing:I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing .\nProject Manager:I like that .\nUser Interface:Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip .\nMarketing:Well there's ano\nProject Manager:Well not n necessarily .\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You could basically make it so that it'll {disfmarker} I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:That's right .\nProject Manager:If you do that .\nUser Interface:Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want ,\nProject Manager:Other than click click click . Yeah .\nUser Interface:but I think once people get used to it {disfmarker} I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though .\nProject Manager:And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Primarily .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah I think so . I I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Now the the only thing I I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} on the interface side of it , is that {vocalsound} I I I see the dilemma . {vocalsound} But if we have the option of of scrolling {vocalsound} at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So I can go uh {vocalsound} presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . {vocalsound} I know what {disfmarker} because it's on the television . The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . So {vocalsound} I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? You understand what I'm saying ?\nUser Interface:I think I know what you might be getting at , or or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh I see so if {disfmarker} maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? And then it {disfmarker} that basically {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh no we could read it from the television .\nUser Interface:Well , what about this {disfmarker} what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels ,\nProject Manager:Mm . Well that's quite cool .\nUser Interface:and it c it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You'd need a display on the th the thing .\nUser Interface:Why ? It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ .\nMarketing:Yeah the the television can tell you .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Can .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about . Yeah that's kinda cool . How would you program it though ?\nUser Interface:Well you just {disfmarker} it's one extra button . You say programme start , and then type in {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Put {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually .\nProject Manager:Okay okay .\nUser Interface:So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , {vocalsound} thirty eight , enter , programme end .\nProject Manager:Okay and yeah\nMarketing:And then .\nProject Manager:and that just basically flips between it and it'll go {disfmarker} it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah that's kinda cool . I like that .\nMarketing:And again we have another another great marketing tool .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:We have about three {disfmarker} we have three or four things here .\nProject Manager:That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be {disfmarker} you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . You could basically {vocalsound} come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . This may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services .\nProject Manager:Might be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . The problem we're gonna have is making it robust . Making it last .\nUser Interface:Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two .\nMarketing:Or we go directional up {vocalsound} we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other .\nProject Manager:So if there's a button {vocalsound} for each type .\nUser Interface:No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels .\nProject Manager:Yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Ah-ha okay . Okay , okay ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah the mode switch .\nUser Interface:I think we'll need a {vocalsound} we'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator\nProject Manager:Just the lights behind the buttons .\nUser Interface:to which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You could have back-lit buttons maybe .\nUser Interface:okay .\nProject Manager:Would that work ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Is that {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:okay we have five minutes . So right details th {vocalsound} that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We want {vocalsound} a mode indicator . We want {vocalsound} back-lit buttons . And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . I've seen some remotes do that .\nUser Interface:Okay . Just so you know I think {disfmarker} I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range .\nProject Manager:I think we are yeah .\nUser Interface:I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah . Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this .\nProject Manager:Yeah well we don't have {vocalsound} it's not that we have more money ,\nMarketing:Didn't you say so ?\nProject Manager:we can push up the the price .\nMarketing:That's what I mean .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:We can increase the cost .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:So I don't know I don't know whether having {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ?\nMarketing:Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit .\nProject Manager:Yeah no I I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . We're entering a new market here ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay I'm I'm okay with that . I guess what I just want {disfmarker} to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level .\nProject Manager:But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ?\nUser Interface:Well y yeah . Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for\nMarketing:We have to find cost .\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} with all these features {disfmarker} how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ?\nProject Manager:But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market .\nUser Interface:I'm just asking you .\nProject Manager:I'm a student , but on the other hand I would think , mm with my Project Manager salary , I would think {disfmarker} yeah I could probably afford this {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:If {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Then you could probably afford this {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:uh would I buy it ? Maybe . If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . Then maybe you know . I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly , that would be way too much ,\nUser Interface:Oh no no .\nProject Manager:but the {disfmarker} I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I would say thirty five to forty .\nMarketing:Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . So the question is what we ca we make it for .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:It's one of the marketing features in this .\nProject Manager:That's why the scroll needs to be really robust .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator .\nUser Interface:With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And it's gonna look sexy {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Or not {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Or not . It might look like clay {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so you can market pe depending on that ?\nMarketing:Yeah yeah . Bas th that's that's easy . That's that's not a , it's a {gap} . 'Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nMarketing:Under the title of uniquenesses .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . The next meeting starts in thirty {vocalsound} minutes , although does it ? It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . So we've got more than a thirty minutes . Um {vocalsound} we've got more like fifty .\nMarketing:Well I have {disfmarker} Is my {disfmarker} three twenty one is the next meeting ?\nProject Manager:The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah .\nMarketing:That's that's almost uh fifty minutes .\nProject Manager:Yeah that is . Uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You guys can {disfmarker} You guys you guys can uh create a {disfmarker} All kinds of things .\nUser Interface:Probably . We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier .\nMarketing:{gap} Thanks , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ?\nUser Interface:I don't think so . If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think it {disfmarker} pretty much everything's covered .\nProject Manager:Okay . This one was quite easy .\nIndustrial Designer:Coulda been worse .\nProject Manager:Always the optimist .\nMarketing:Still .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes I am .\nProject Manager:'Kay thanks guys .\nMarketing:Thank you . I don't have any emails . This means I can go home . Oh , we all leave . {gap}\n",
        "summary": "This was a conceptual design meeting, at which some decisions on product components, functional design, and pricing were made. The group spent a lot of time discussing the components of the device, especially the scroll wheel and power source. The main topics in the discussion about functional design were speech recognition and the function of rolling through the user's favourite channels. The former was abandoned while the latter was adopted by the group for its novelty and feasibility. After discussing the functions, the group thought they were approaching the high-end market, so they could push up the price. In spite of that, the project manager supposed the profit expectation might not be so important as opening up a new market and promoting their brand. In the end, they agreed to price the product at thirty-five to fifty Euros.",

        "conversations": "Marketing:It's Play-Doh .\nProject Manager:Play-Doh's edible . Did you know that ? It's definitely {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Because kids {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I used to eat it .\nUser Interface:I've , I've definitely eaten it before . I didn't know was edible . {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It's it's chew proof . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah . It's made edible 'cause kids eat it ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and if it's wasn't edible then {disfmarker} Well , normal babies . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the {gap} colouring and make some sort of sort of dough .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Everybody everybody ready ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , let's have your um {disfmarker} let's get {gap} have the uh presentation ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:We've got some {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:We've got a cool prototype .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So , everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use ,\nIndustrial Designer:Double curved .\nProject Manager:Nice .\nUser Interface:yeah , double curved ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That is cool .\nUser Interface:So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , {vocalsound} the thumb button is the power button .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down .\nMarketing:What's the big blue thing ?\nUser Interface:That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it\nMarketing:Oh cool .\nUser Interface:and then the M_ is a mute button . And then it also has digit\nProject Manager:{gap} what button ? Um . Oh mute .\nUser Interface:For muting the uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And mute .\nUser Interface:Um and then then you can also {disfmarker} there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .\nProject Manager:That certainly does .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ .\nUser Interface:So you don't you {disfmarker} Yeah . It should be .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know\nProject Manager:Yeah . 'S great .\nUser Interface:change that . So d does that uh what {disfmarker} mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh it's so cute .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right , yeah .\nUser Interface:Ah , that's good thinking , yeah .\nProject Manager:But , that's I don't see why that's not possible .\nUser Interface:Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {gap} They make left-handed scissors , you know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd {disfmarker} yeah , {gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?\nProject Manager:Yes s\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer {vocalsound} for the whole {disfmarker} the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .\nProject Manager:Mm . Sure . Sure .\nMarketing:Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Imagine d are you right handed ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , it's not {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But we can have both uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Have them in stock .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Make 'em more appealing as well .\nProject Manager:But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea .\nUser Interface:Do you think it says {vocalsound} R_R_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} I think it does . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable .\nUser Interface:Fashion to electronics . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} There you go .\nUser Interface:So that's that's {vocalsound} our end of things wha uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , very good , yeah .\nUser Interface:That's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've {disfmarker} what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , {gap} all seems to be there .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well done .\nMarketing:And all the playing around is uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um before we move on {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , I'm just {disfmarker} do you wanna plug in ?\nProject Manager:I need that cable .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Thank you . Yeah . Um . One thing I do need to do {disfmarker} we need to look at , is the costs .\nUser Interface:The costs , was that what you said ?\nIndustrial Designer:Play-Doh is very cheap . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{gap} um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But it's edible .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Chew proof .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , {gap} .\nUser Interface:That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Uh right . {vocalsound} Okay , now I think we'll do this {disfmarker} I could do {disfmarker} you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh ho-ho .\nProject Manager:but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . Ooh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} the case , we've gone for the double curved . Um and it's made out of rubber . {vocalsound} The interface is push-buttons . And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So {gap} special colours .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's better for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I mean , {vocalsound} these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And special material .\nProject Manager:Yep . Yeah . Um . Are they made out of any special material ?\nIndustrial Designer:Rubber .\nProject Manager:No they're not . They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:The buttons are rubber .\nMarketing:Well they're rubber , aren't they ?\nProject Manager:Okay . Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . That is gonna cost uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:We're under budget .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty .\nUser Interface:That's cool . Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So ,\nUser Interface:And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected .\nProject Manager:this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Save it in {gap} save it in the uh {vocalsound} my documents .\nMarketing:It's already saved , I think .\nProject Manager:Splendid . Okay . So uh , that's {gap} done with this with this um doodah , so you're {gap} . Gonna do {disfmarker} what you were gonna do ,\nMarketing:Thank you . Mm .\nProject Manager:your evaluation .\nMarketing:Oh , yeah . This is where we all get to {vocalsound} I get to write on the , oops , on the board . Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh . 'S function {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:F_ eight .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap} I love the smell of that Play-Doh .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I cou {gap} . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:have some have some .\nMarketing:Okay . So , {vocalsound} evaluation . We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . I've got the criterias . And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's {disfmarker} fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so we have a box {disfmarker} {gap} . And this is false , this is just like to keep you informed . So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . {vocalsound} So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it {disfmarker} is it colour-wise and is it spongy ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:So what mark should we give for that ?\nProject Manager:I would give it a seven .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:As in it's not .\nProject Manager:Oh sorry , one , d yeah .\nUser Interface:Oh , sorry , one . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:A one .\nMarketing:A one a one . So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . Second criteria , new technology . Have we implemented new technology ? As in the new high-tech {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nMarketing:So it's {gap} . So we'll give it a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well so the um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's ergonomic ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but that's not {disfmarker} that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . True .\nProject Manager:So on the technical side of it it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . I'd say it's about a a twoish ?\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nUser Interface:It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere ,\nMarketing:Two .\nUser Interface:maybe , yeah , I dunno .\nMarketing:Three .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Maybe three , yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} three . So criteria three is is it easy to use ?\nProject Manager:Easy to use .\nMarketing:I think it's a one , I think .\nProject Manager:I'd say it's I wouldn't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:not if you're left-handed it's not . I would give it a I would give it a two ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Two ,\nProject Manager:'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:so it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ?\nUser Interface:If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Give it a t give it a two .\nMarketing:Yeah , okay . {vocalsound} 'Kay , criteria four is costs . {gap}\nProject Manager:Cost . It's come in under budget .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} 's great .\nProject Manager:So that's a definite one .\nUser Interface:Yeah . That was great .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Amount of buttons .\nMarketing:Like the amount of buttons ,\nProject Manager:Contains only the necessary buttons .\nMarketing:'cause people like a lot le like {disfmarker} So it's a one ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yes s yeah .\nMarketing:Yes . Very good .\nProject Manager:So it's anti-R_S_I_ .\nMarketing:It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's yellow .\nMarketing:Is it easy to get lost ?\nProject Manager:I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It is very bright , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No ? But it is smallish .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nUser Interface:It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . Maybe it will . Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:T\nMarketing:Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost .\nUser Interface:You think it could lost {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} two .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:I mean it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean it's not fully it's not fully {disfmarker} like you can't say {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No , I mean\nMarketing:I mean , it's not a one , definitely .\nProject Manager:I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But , yeah , it can get lost .\nMarketing:The mobiles get lost all the time .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay , yeah , two is fine .\nMarketing:But then you ring 'em and you find them . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah . So , that's that . So that's the evaluation , so I'd say {disfmarker} Yay .\nProject Manager:Alright it's all all systems go .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We've , we've done well .\nMarketing:It's like {vocalsound} {gap} like a number one . Um .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Number one product .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We can't fail .\nMarketing:All done , thanks . We fitted all the criterias . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well done , Reissa .\nMarketing:So that's that one .\nProject Manager:Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's all , you know , gone very very well\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and and and be you know , has been good communication going on . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but we we kept {disfmarker} we tried to keep it cool and and\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:just just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Fantastic .\nIndustrial Designer:It is {gap} .\nUser Interface:Now you guys have been a a great team . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , {gap} .\nMarketing:{gap} been cool .\nProject Manager:I think {disfmarker} So\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't {disfmarker} we're not just rehashing an old design .\nMarketing:In four diff in in four meetings .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick .\nProject Manager:You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually {disfmarker} so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , {gap} they get {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:They're using our ideas .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , {gap} two years' time this will be on the market .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ex exactly that product\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um thum {disfmarker} we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:No ,\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Y Oh really ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Or six , uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Just start summarising now . {vocalsound} You can reply to the same message .\nProject Manager:I haven't got message .\nMarketing:See summary , there . If you just reply to that one .\nUser Interface:So there's no way to like predict what our {disfmarker} 'Cause we had a {disfmarker} we originally had a {vocalsound} {disfmarker} As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . It was fifty mil fifty million {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Was it was it fifty or five ?\nUser Interface:I don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?\nProject Manager:It gets handed over to another department .\nMarketing:Depends how much we sell .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:{gap} the for the {disfmarker} and just basically is it it come {disfmarker} can {disfmarker} is it within budget . When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments {disfmarker} it's another team that actually work out the mai the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But we have a vested interest {gap}\nProject Manager:oh yeah , the {disfmarker} all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah .\nUser Interface:prof profit sharing {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um . Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made\nMarketing:We finished an hour earlier . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's {disfmarker} does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um something that uh {vocalsound} that isn't out there already .\nUser Interface:I think actually {disfmarker} and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that ,\nMarketing:Definitely .\nProject Manager:it's {disfmarker} that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's {disfmarker} whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know ,\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm .\nProject Manager:so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new .\nUser Interface:Mm . It make watching T_V_ healthy .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's fine , it's kid proof .\nMarketing:Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that .\nMarketing:No {gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yep .\nProject Manager:Well done everybody .\nUser Interface:Right , you too .\nMarketing:Yay .\nProject Manager:Um . Drinks are on the company .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Glad to hear that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . That's it .\nUser Interface:That's it .\nProject Manager:Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um .\nMarketing:Yep . We haven't got the five minute left thing yet .\nProject Manager:No . Anyone wanna play I spy ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . Should we call the day then ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I guess . I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire .\nUser Interface:Uh , right .\nProject Manager:Um . It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:But I'm not the authority to say that it is .\nMarketing:In {gap} project .\nProject Manager:Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?\nMarketing:I love it . {vocalsound} I love it . {vocalsound} I think it's cool .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and {disfmarker} it's cool .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Being watched . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Your moment to shine .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Wow .\nProject Manager:I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not {disfmarker} never seen that before . {gap} something that t the whiteboard\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:thingy , {vocalsound} that's great . Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Logitech .\nUser Interface:I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic . So . Shall we {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Meeting adjourned .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\n",
        "summary": "The meeting began with a presentation on the prototype by Industrial Designer and User Interface and a double curved rubber prototype with anti-RSI buttons was displayed. Next, they discussed the cost of the remote which only cost ten seventy euros a unit and well under the budget of twelve fifty. Then, the team evaluated the remote according to seven criteria and it passed with flying colours as three criteria scored a one and others no more than three. Finally, the meeting ended with team building and a wrap-up, which Project Marketing concluded that the novel remote fit all criteria and the team did a great job.",

And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Alright . Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:so first let's go through this PowerPoint . I wonder what button I press ?\nUser Interface:Just do it on the {gap} arrow .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah , or how about I just click ? Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . {vocalsound} We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . Okay , here is our project . We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um {disfmarker} We're gonna have {disfmarker} discuss the functional design first , {vocalsound} how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here .\nIndustrial Designer:I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing .\nMarketing:We could {disfmarker} Yeah , we could on here .\nProject Manager:Alright , let's go forward then .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . Even if you are not a good drawer like me .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Artistic skills , nil .\nUser Interface:Fine .\nProject Manager:Um .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh , thanks . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Bless you .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I draw like I'm in grade five .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh do I .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay , about one more minute . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . And who would like to start us off ?\nMarketing:I'll go .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um this is my picture . I drew fish {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's pretty cool , and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Only if they're piranhas .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , they they're easy , you know .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Who wants to go next ?\nIndustrial Designer:I'll go .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I drew a kitty . It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats .\nMarketing:No I I see it .\nProject Manager:No , it looks like a cat .\nUser Interface:No , I kne I knew .\nMarketing:Yeah , it does look like a cat .\nIndustrial Designer:I love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I love cats , too . I'm a cat person .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I'm allergic to cats .\nProject Manager:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm allergic to cats , too . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Ah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh , okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:If you're around one {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:In my next life .\nProject Manager:I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know ,\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:it's weird . Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I still can't sleep with them in my room .\nMarketing:Oh , yeah , this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . It was crazy .\nProject Manager:Okay , Fenella ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um , I drew a badger . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Badger . Good choice .\nIndustrial Designer:Yay .\nMarketing:Cool . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well , yeah .\nProject Manager:Why a badger ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh I dunno , they're grumpy and nocturnal and {vocalsound} {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Are you trying to suggest something ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well , a little bit like the {disfmarker} Yes . Um . {vocalsound} And then , if you know Wind in the Willows {gap} badger .\nMarketing:Oh , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian {gap} . He's Liverpudlian writer .\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:Um {gap} , that kind of books . Badgers are cool in that one too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . And I'm last . 'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe .\nMarketing:No , that's good .\nProject Manager:No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . They're just such odd creatures , you know . I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . Only seen a couple in zoos .\nMarketing:You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . Okay . Alright . Guess we're getting straight back into business here .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . Okay . So we're gonna talk for a little while . Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . So .\nUser Interface:Now ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . You wanna start us off ? Anybody have anything to offer ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ?\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:One remote for everything .\nUser Interface:And everything being {disfmarker} Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ?\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Um . I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly .\nMarketing:Yeah , TiVo .\nProject Manager:TiVo .\nUser Interface:But it's still there , so\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:if po if we're gonna do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal .\nProject Manager:They're never universal . That's right . Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a {disfmarker} I don't know .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . Something from Sam's club .\nIndustrial Designer:So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways .\nProject Manager:Yeah . 'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't {disfmarker} Nobody wants to buy those any more . They want the ergonomic ones .\nMarketing:They want like the flashy lights .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Oh like this came from Las Vegas .\nProject Manager:Ones that ones that look high-tech , too .\nUser Interface:But at the same time are simple .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Mm yeah .\nProject Manager:So that people like my mother can use it .\nIndustrial Designer:What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'Kay . Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Just bad ones . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah {gap} . {vocalsound} That's true .\nUser Interface:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:What kinda battery would we want to use ? Because battery changing is usually {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:D Double A_ .\nMarketing:Double A_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Do some of them use triple A_s though ?\nMarketing:Yeah some use triple A_s .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Some but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So double or triple ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I guess then it's {disfmarker} If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah . But that has to do with the size of it too . Well , w as long as we know that issue is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Here we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ .\nProject Manager:Triple A . But\nIndustrial Designer:Can you {gap} with a small lithium battery ?\nProject Manager:it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hey . Anything else ? Alright . Moving along . Oh , we're closing the meeting . Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . Here's what we're going to do . Um the I_D_ , which is who ? Okay , you're going to think about the working design . What do you think that means ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . Okay . And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . Right ? I would think so . Okay .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? Okay . This meeting is officially over .\n",
        "summary": "This is the first of a series of meetings devoted to the design of a remote control, and it aims only at the proposition of general first ideas on the project. Project Manager started off the meeting by introducing the team and their plan for the project. The team got to know each other better by drawing out their favourite animals and justifying their choice. Project Manager then invited everyone to raise ideas about the remote. Their discussion included its multifunctional nature, ergonomic design and battery type, but there was no final decision on these matters. The work was split among the team members, as each took up the task of the working design, the technical functions design, or marketing.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} So um nice to see you again . Uh . So , uh . Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . Uh so we will see our three presentations . Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .\nMarketing:Okay , can I have the laptop over here , or ?\nProject Manager:Yep . Oh , I don't think so . I think you have to come here .\nMarketing:Okay . Have to get up . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I dunno . I think it should stay .\nMarketing:Excuse me .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's it .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Should stay in the square here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Oh , maybe .\nMarketing:Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control .\nProject Manager:Oh , you can put it here . Oh that's okay , it's jus\nMarketing:Um so first of all we {disfmarker} what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . Completely ugly . Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most {disfmarker} by far the most used buttons on the remote control . Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came {disfmarker} they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . Um and the audio and picture settings had a very {disfmarker} that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . {vocalsound} So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . Um {vocalsound} they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . Um and then thirdly , they {disfmarker} some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the {disfmarker} on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . They want these features , they want these high technology features .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . Whereas um {vocalsound} the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:That's my dic that's my presentation . Thank you .\nProject Manager:Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So , um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , okay , yeah . Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager .\nProject Manager:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Sorry , I'm {disfmarker} Sorry . Sorry .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:If I could go there with this cable .\nIndustrial Designer:You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think ,\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .\nIndustrial Designer:At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Sh okay . {gap}\nMarketing:It is true .\nUser Interface:Where's delete button ? Okay . Oh I'm sorry . {vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:{gap} Okay .\nMarketing:That's the wrong one , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's still Bob Morris .\nUser Interface:Oh . Presentation three ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah you should have put yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Because you cancelled it . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Click on yes .\nUser Interface:Oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nUser Interface:Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . Okay , {vocalsound} uh about {disfmarker} what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to {disfmarker} for designing a remote control . They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves .\nIndustrial Designer:You still want me the presentation .\nUser Interface:There are two different uh uh solutions I mean . This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . And uh also as uh I understood , and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with {disfmarker} uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Okay . That was my presentation .\nMarketing:Okay . I have a question .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?\nUser Interface:Uh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the {vocalsound} with other devices inside the home .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So can we use any any frequency ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it should be okay {gap} .\nProject Manager:We have the right to use any frequency ?\nUser Interface:Uh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission .\nProject Manager:Okay . And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same {disfmarker} have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ?\nUser Interface:Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it\nProject Manager:Okay . A kind of identification {gap} ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , identification code inside the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah f {vocalsound} uh I know about this , since it's my {disfmarker} it's exactly my field , so .\nProject Manager:okay . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to {disfmarker} uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:The password may simply {disfmarker} uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . A specific uh remote control has a specific f\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . It's worth to buy .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And they have these problems solved so . So we don't have to think about these .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So , maybe you can talk about the function , and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . I have only a couple of things because I had {disfmarker} I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . I was used to use Linux before , so . But I tried to tried to break through this {gap} too , I guess .\nProject Manager:Open .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Ah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound} How to make it big ?\nProject Manager:Slide show .\nUser Interface:Five . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Slide show . Okay , thanks . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It should work , so you can {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Oh so I will speak about working design . That's the first slide . Uh what uh I have to do ? A look at what the other company {disfmarker} Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication {disfmarker} for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them .\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So , you know . Uh , okay findings , that's {gap} the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave {disfmarker} radio frequency circuits are available now ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but the prices I read are high . So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . Uh . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:because the speech rec Yeah ?\nMarketing:Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?\nIndustrial Designer:No no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves .\nMarketing:Okay s So we just buy a circuit board and {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Exactly .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . This I prefer that we should make ourselves .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . Same thing . It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . So , speech recognition {disfmarker} well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the {disfmarker} what does it offer , you know .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I'm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or it would be maybe feasible ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . I was not thinking too much about the price . But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not {disfmarker} Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:We will discuss it afterwards . Oh , this is nothing . This is just my notes on what to use . And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . That's my opinion . Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency .\nProject Manager:Why ? Because it's simpler ?\nIndustrial Designer:Because because the the range where you can use it is fair .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:It's okay I think . And the price is fairly cheap for this .\nProject Manager:Okay . It's a a price matter .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , depends .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Jus just the price .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So I I I think it's o y o {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:What how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ?\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , three to three to five .\nMarketing:Or ten times more expensive ? Or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:N not ten times ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but it depends what what we {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah . That's still a lot . I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money ,\nProject Manager:Hmm . Yeah .\nMarketing:because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it's not worth spending the extra money .\nProject Manager:Well I {gap} , oh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know .\nProject Manager:On the other side , we want to have something new .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You know , where\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . But maybe {gap} .\nMarketing:But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are {disfmarker} prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} You the user interface , and management man , uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay , that's it for me .\nProject Manager:Okay , thank you Peter .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . Uh apparently it becomes from {disfmarker} according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . And uh {disfmarker} Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . Um . So I think we can avoid the teletext . Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it {disfmarker} it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the {disfmarker} only specific T_V_ remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:I agree . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The third {vocalsound} the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh {disfmarker} The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh It's {disfmarker} That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of {disfmarker} in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . So , um {disfmarker} So now we we should take the decision what we are going to {disfmarker} what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? Uh .\nMarketing:Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And then we can move on to the more advanced features .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yes .\nProject Manager:Maybe , maybe .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . Uh radio frequency depends . And , well the recognition it depends on you guys .\nProject Manager:Yeah but first maybe what is {disfmarker} what are the usual function of a standard remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer:You should probably speak .\nProject Manager:I mean\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:what do {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . Do we {disfmarker} will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? I mean those nine plus one or two ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I think it would be a b {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm . {gap}\nProject Manager:On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons .\nProject Manager:Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button .\nProject Manager:uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Maybe something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Or using the names and the keyboard {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} Ah yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno .\nUser Interface:Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Or something {gap} .\nProject Manager:Oh I don't know . Oh . Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You mean like hierarchical structure .\nProject Manager:And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Okay . Like categorising channels .\nProject Manager:If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so s\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh sorry .\nProject Manager:I It just an idea .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:I don't know what you think about that but .\nIndustrial Designer:So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:To have some feedback . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ .\nMarketing:We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:So we c you could quickly just {vocalsound} {vocalsound} through many channels .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Like roller for the {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} For the channels , perhaps .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Anything else ?\nMarketing:So we've got channel and volume . Um .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So we are still s speaking about the common devices\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:or we are inviting the new one ?\nMarketing:I think so .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones .\nProject Manager:What about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's {disfmarker} we need it anyway . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:On the screen , you mean ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah b {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Not on the control , but on the screen .\nUser Interface:Not on the control , on the screen , on the T_V_ screen .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then .\nUser Interface:And then {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones . I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price .\nUser Interface:{gap} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings {disfmarker} if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Two T_V_s .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I mean there's always {disfmarker} we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of {disfmarker} under a slide or some\nProject Manager:Yeah . Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like ma\nProject Manager:Oh , the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Or I dunno .\nUser Interface:{gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or like children and grandfather's mode ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and the , well the the user\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:not the user , the man mana T_V_ manager mode {vocalsound} . Ah , I dunno .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay . So we have five minutes left . Um .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nMarketing:So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing {disfmarker} are agreed that they're required .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:It's just how to a\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We should hide them somewhere .\nIndustrial Designer:Hide them , okay .\nProject Manager:In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Uh , okay , what else ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um . {gap} Yes .\nMarketing:I mean a power button's obviously\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ?\nMarketing:uh required .\nIndustrial Designer:Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's it's a kind of setting , I think . It should fit in those settings functions .\nUser Interface:Mm . Settings .\nProject Manager:Because it's not a very current useful function .\nMarketing:Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off .\nProject Manager:No , I think it's after after five minutes or something {gap} a timer {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Well I I uh\nProject Manager:I I think , no ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You don't need to {disfmarker} every five minutes to keep it alive .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh probably . Okay , so we should keep this button .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I mean based on our usability studies again , um {vocalsound} pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button .\nProject Manager:Oh okay , yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um , you know , it was nine out of ten\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff ,\nMarketing:re relevance .\nIndustrial Designer:we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are {disfmarker} you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:turn off the T_V_ .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:If if you like this , {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . B Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Because , well {gap} {disfmarker} it's maybe question for you t\nMarketing:I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So s yeah .\nMarketing:Um and all the other f functionality is\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this .\nMarketing:not used very often .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Like covering cu .\nProject Manager:On the back , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I mean like the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , like mobile phone covering .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:For what ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh power button .\nMarketing:I think a button .\nUser Interface:A button is better .\nProject Manager:Ah oh yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:I think it should be a bu\nIndustrial Designer:If it if it's a button or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah a button , yeah I guess so .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Its own button on the front .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , one nice big button .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So , any other suggestions or functions ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:S What about things like the clock and um timers ?\nIndustrial Designer:Do we still have the time ? I I just wonder .\nProject Manager:Yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Oh . Well what w what was the question ?\nUser Interface:Clock or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:no ? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:This is the question .\nMarketing:Probably not .\nProject Manager:Is it useful ?\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off .\nProject Manager:W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want {disfmarker} The simpler it's is better .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah , yeah .\nMarketing:Okay simple .\nIndustrial Designer:Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:well {disfmarker} And based on your {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Very , yeah okay , very occasionally .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah that's okay , that's true . Okay , so no time button {gap} . Okay .\nProject Manager:No time on {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes yes .\nProject Manager:I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . It doesn't take that much place and also that much {disfmarker} It doesn't cost that much .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . If we use the speech recognition .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So maybe we think {disfmarker} we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time {disfmarker} next time .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . Somebody booked the meeting room just for {disfmarker} at one P_M_ , and so we should leave . Uh . So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch . It's uh funded by the company . And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . And uh I will do the minutes . And uh you are going to work on your individual works . And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on .\nMarketing:Okay ,\nProject Manager:Thank you everybody .\nMarketing:cool . Okay\nUser Interface:Thanks .\nMarketing:Thank you .\n",
        "summary": "This meeting included three presentations from marketing, user interface and industrial design and discussion about core function of remote control. At first, marketing introduced the conclusion of experiment and questionnaire. Users thought remote controls were ugly and only used a few buttons. Since young users might prefer high technology features like speech recognition. After that, the user interface introduced how electric circuits, keyboard and transmitter reacted together. And group members discussed solutions of wave interference. Then industrial designer talked about working design and how LCD display or speech recognition might influence the design of circuits. And whether adding these functions would make the price out of range was discussed. After discussing new requirements for remote control from management, the group members started with core and basic functions, such as necessary buttons. Finally, they mentioned something about speech recognition and speech commands and their influence on battery life.",

I didn't\nProfessor D:Um , I got this from you\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:and then I sent a note to Sunil about the {disfmarker} cuz he has been running some other systems\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:other than the {disfmarker} the ICSI OGI one .\nPhD A:Oh yeah .\nProfessor D:So {pause} um , I wan wanna {disfmarker} wanna see what that is . But , uh , you know , so we 'll see what it is comparatively later . But {pause} it looks like , um\nPhD A:M yeah .\nProfessor D:You know most of the time , even {disfmarker} I mean even though it 's true that the overall number for Danish {disfmarker} we didn't improve it If you look at it individually , what it really says is that there 's , um , uh Looks like out of the six cases , between the different kinds of , uh , matching conditions {pause} out of the six cases , there 's basically , um , a couple where it stays about the same , uh , three where it gets better , and one where it gets worse .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:Uh , go ahead .\nPhD A:Y Actually , uh , um , for the Danish , there 's still some kind of mystery because , um , um , when we use the straight features , we are not able to get these nice number with the ICSI OGI one , I mean . We don't have this ninety - three seventy - eight , we have eight\nPhD E:Eighty - nine forty - four .\nPhD A:yeah . Uh , so , uh , that 's probably something wrong with the features that we get from OGI . Uh , and Sunil is working on {disfmarker} on trying to {disfmarker} to check everything .\nProfessor D:Oh , and {disfmarker} and we have a little time on that {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} actually so\nPhD A:Hmm ?\nProfessor D:We have a little bit of time on that , actually .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:We have a day or so , so When {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when do you folks leave ?\nPhD A:Uh , Sunday .\nProfessor D:Sunday ? So So , uh Yeah , until Saturday midnight , or something , we have W we {disfmarker} we have time , yeah . Well , that would be good . That 'd be good .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:Yeah . Uh , and , you know , i u when whenever anybody figures it out they should also , for sure , email Hynek because Hynek will be over there {vocalsound} telling people {vocalsound} what we did , so he should know .\nPhD A:Mmm . Yeah .\nProfessor D:Good , OK . So , um So , we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll hold off on that a little bit . I mean , even with these results as they are , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not that bad . But {disfmarker} but , uh , um And it looks like the overall result as they are now , even without , you know , any {disfmarker} any bugs being fixed is that , uh , on the {disfmarker} the other tasks , we had this average of , uh , forty uh {disfmarker} nine percent , or so , improvement . And here we have somewhat better than that than the Danish , and somewhat worse than that on the German , but I mean , it sounds like , uh , one way or another , the methods that we 're doing can reduce the error rate from {disfmarker} from mel ceptrum {pause} down by , you know {pause} a fourth of them to , uh , a half of them . Somewhere in there , depending on the {pause} exact case . So So that 's good . I mean , I think that , uh , one of the things that Hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals and {disfmarker} and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some , uh , combination of things . Um , if , uh {disfmarker} Cuz there 's things that they are doing {pause} there that we certainly are not doing . And there 's things that we 're doing that {pause} they 're not doing . And {disfmarker} and they all seem like good things .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:So\nPhD E:Mmm , yeah .\nPhD C:How much {disfmarker} how much better was the best system than ours ?\nProfessor D:So Well , we don't know yet .\nPhD C:Mmm .\nProfessor D:Uh , I mean , first place , there 's still this thing to {disfmarker} to work out , and second place {disfmarker} second thing is that the only results that we have so far from before were really development set results .\nPhD C:Oh , OK .\nProfessor D:So , I think in this community that 's of interest . It 's not like everything is being pinned on the evaluation set . But , um , for the development set , our best result was a little bit short of fifty percent . And the best result of any system was about fifty - four , where these numbers are the , uh , relative , uh , reduction in , uh , word error rate .\nPhD C:Oh , OK .\nProfessor D:And , um , the other systems were , uh , somewhat lower than that . There was actually {disfmarker} there was much less of a huge range than there was in Aurora one . In Aurora one there were {disfmarker} there were systems that ba basically didn't improve things .\nPhD C:Hmm .\nProfessor D:And here the {disfmarker} the worst system {pause} still reduced the error rate by thirty - three percent , or something , in development set .\nPhD C:Oh , wow .\nProfessor D:So {disfmarker} so , you know , sort of everybody is doing things between , well , roughly a third of the errors , and half the errors being eliminated , {vocalsound} uh , and varying on different test sets and so forth .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:So I think Um {pause} It 's probably a good time to look at what 's really going on and seeing if there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a way to combine the best ideas while at the same time not blowing up the amount of , uh , resources used , cuz that 's {disfmarker} that 's critical for this {disfmarker} this test .\nPhD C:Do we know anything about {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who 's was it that had the lowest on the dev set ?\nProfessor D:Um , uh , the , uh , the there were two systems that were put forth by a combination of {disfmarker} of , uh , French Telecom and Alcatel . And , um they {disfmarker} they differed in some respects , but they e em one was called the French Telecom Alcatel System the other was called the Alcatel French Telecom System , {vocalsound} uh , which is the biggest difference , I think . But {disfmarker} but there 're {disfmarker} there 're {disfmarker} there 're some other differences , too . Uh , and {disfmarker} and , uh , they both did very well ,\nPhD C:Uh - huh .\nProfessor D:you know ? So , {vocalsound} um , my impression is they also did very well on {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} the , uh , evaluation set , but , um , I {disfmarker} I we haven't seen {disfmarker} you 've - you haven't seen any final results for that\nPhD C:And they used {disfmarker} the main thing that {disfmarker} that they used was spectral subtraction ?\nProfessor D:yeah .\nPhD C:Or\nProfessor D:There is a couple pieces to it . There 's a spectral subtraction style piece {disfmarker} it was basically , you know , Wiener filtering . And then {disfmarker} then there was some p some modification of the cepstral parameters , where they {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Yeah , actually , something that 's close to cepstral mean subtraction . But , uh , the way the mean is adapted {disfmarker} um , it 's signal dependent . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm , uh So , basically , the mean is adapted during speech and not during silence .\nProfessor D:Yeah .\nPhD A:But it 's very close to {disfmarker} to cepstral mean subtraction .\nProfessor D:But some people have done {vocalsound} {pause} exactly that sort of thing , of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} I mean it 's not {disfmarker} To {disfmarker} to look in {pause} speech only , to try to m to measure these things during speech ,\nPhD A:Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor D:that 's p that 's not that uncommon . But i it it {disfmarker} so it looks like they did some {disfmarker} some , uh , reasonable things , uh , and they 're not things that we did , precisely . We did unreasonable things , {vocalsound} which {disfmarker} because we like to try strange things , and {disfmarker} and , uh , and our things worked too .\nPhD C:Hmm .\nProfessor D:And so , um , uh , it 's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do . But the only caveat to that is that everybody 's being real conscious of how much memory and how much CPU they 're using\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:because these , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , standards are supposed to go on cell phones with m moderate resources in both respects .\nPhD C:Did anybody , uh , do anything with the models as a {disfmarker} an experiment ? Or\nProfessor D:Uh , they didn't report it , if they did .\nPhD C:N nobody reported it ?\nProfessor D:Yeah . I think everybody was focused elsewhere . Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a {disfmarker} a , uh {disfmarker} a filtering , which leads to a {disfmarker} a , uh {disfmarker} a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample . So , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:That was misreported the first time out . It {disfmarker} it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested , uh , they were repeating the packets . So it was {disfmarker} they were s they {disfmarker} they had twenty - four hundred bits per second , but they were literally creating forty - eight hundred bits per second , {vocalsound} um , even though y it was just repeated .\nPhD C:Oh . Mm - hmm . Right .\nProfessor D:So , uh , in practice\nPhD C:So you could 've had a repeat count in there or something .\nProfessor D:Well , n I mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to {disfmarker} to fit into the {disfmarker} the software that was testing the errors {disfmarker} channel errors and so on .\nPhD C:Oh . Oh .\nProfessor D:So {disfmarker} so in reality , if you put this {disfmarker} this system in into , uh , the field , it would be twenty - four hundred bits per second , not forty - eight hundred . So , um , so that 's a nice feature of what {disfmarker} what we did . Um , but , um , well , we still have to see how it all comes out .\nPhD C:Hmm .\nProfessor D:Um , and then there 's the whole standards process , which is another thing altogether .\nPhD C:When is the development set {disfmarker} I mean , the , uh , uh , test set results due ? Like the day before you leave or something ?\nProfessor D:Uh , probably the day after they leave , but we 'll have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we 'll have to stop it the day before {comment} we leave .\nPhD A:Yeah , yeah . So\nPhD C:Huh .\nProfessor D:I think tha I think the {disfmarker} the meeting is on the thirteenth or something .\nPhD A:Yeah , this Tuesday , yeah .\nProfessor D:And , uh , they , uh Right . And the {disfmarker} the , uh , results are due like the day before the meeting or something . So\nPhD A:Yeah , probably , well\nProfessor D:I th I think {disfmarker} I I think they are ,\nPhD A:Yeah , well\nProfessor D:yeah . So {pause} {vocalsound} um , since we have a bit farther to travel than {vocalsound} some of the others , {vocalsound} uh , we 'll have to get done a little quicker . But , um , I mean , it 's just tracing down these bugs . I mean , just exactly this sort of thing of , you know , why {disfmarker} why these features seem to be behaving differently , uh , in California than in Oregon .\nPhD C: Hmm .\nProfessor D:Might have something to do with electricity shortage . Uh , we didn't {disfmarker} we didn't have enough electrons here and Uh , but , um Uh , I think , you know , the main reason for having {disfmarker} I mean , it only takes w to run the {disfmarker} the two test sets in {disfmarker} just in computer time is just a day or so , right ?\nPhD A:Yeah ,\nProfessor D:So\nPhD A:it 's very short interval .\nProfessor D:yeah . So , I think the who the whole reason for having as long as we have , which was {pause} like a week and a half , is {disfmarker} is because of bugs like that . So Huh So , we 're gonna end up with these same kind of sheets that have the {pause} the percentages and so on just for the {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Yeah , so there are two more columns in the sheets ,\nProfessor D:Oh , I guess it 's the same sheets ,\nPhD A:two . Yeah , it 's the same sheets ,\nProfessor D:yeah , yeah {disfmarker}\nPhD A:yeah .\nProfessor D:just with the missing columns filled in .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:Yeah . Well , that 'll be good . So , I 'll dis I 'll disregard these numbers . That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's good .\nPhD A:So , Hynek will try to push for trying to combine , uh , different things ? Or Hmm ?\nProfessor D:Uh , well that 's {pause} um yeah I mean , I think the question is \" Is there {disfmarker} is there some advantage ? \" I mean , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard . But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do Now for instance , uh , it 's , I think , very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal 's side and then for the server 's side say , \" Here 's a number of things that could be done . \" So , um , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did , and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too . So , um , uh , that 's one {disfmarker} one aspect of it . And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and {disfmarker} and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering {pause} Uh , I mean , the VAD stuff they both had , right ? And , um , so {disfmarker} and they both had some kind of on - line normalization , right ?\nPhD A:Uh , yeah .\nProfessor D:Of sorts , yeah ? So {disfmarker} so , it seems like the main different there is the {disfmarker} is the , uh , filtering . And the filtering {disfmarker} I think if you can {disfmarker} shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that Uh , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , uh , would be much either for that part . So , if you can {disfmarker} if you can add those in {pause} um {pause} then , uh , you can cut the data rate in half .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:So it seems like the right thing to do is to {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} on the terminal 's side , take what they did , if it {disfmarker} if it does seem to generalize well to German and Danish , uh , take what they did add in a filter , and add in some stuff on the server 's side and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and that 's probably a reasonable standard . Um {pause} Uh\nPhD A:They are working on this already ? Because {disfmarker} yeah , Su - Sunil told me that he was trying already to put some kind of , uh , filtering in the {vocalsound} {pause} France Telecom .\nProfessor D:Yeah , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's what That would be ideal {disfmarker} would be is that they could , you know , they could actually show that , in fact , a combination of some sort , {vocalsound} uh , would work even better than what {disfmarker} what any of the systems had . And , um , then it would {disfmarker} it would , uh {pause} be something to {disfmarker} to discuss in the meeting . But , uh , not clear what will go on . Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there . I mean , you can always have another standard after that , but {vocalsound} this process has gone on for a while on {disfmarker} already and {disfmarker} and people might just wanna pick something and say , \" OK , this is it . \" And then , that 's a standard . Uh , standards are always optional . It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , or {pause} {vocalsound} Uh {pause} um And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on . So it 's not final even if they declared a standard . The other hand , they might just say they just don't know enough yet to {disfmarker} to declare a standard . So you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you will be {disfmarker} you will become experts on this and know more {disfmarker} far more than me about the tha this particular standards process once you {disfmarker} you go to this meeting . So , be interested in hearing . So , uh , I 'd be , uh , interested in hearing , uh , your thoughts now I mean you 're almost done . I mean , you 're done in the sense that , um , you may be able to get some new features from Sunil , and we 'll re - run it . Uh , but other than that , you 're {disfmarker} you 're basically done , right ? So , uh , I 'm interested in hearing {disfmarker} hearing your thoughts about {pause} where you think we should go from this .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:I mean , we tried a lot of things in a hurry , and , uh , if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something , and not have doing things quickly be quite so much the constraint , what {disfmarker} what you think would be the best thing to do .\nPhD A:Uh , well Hmm Well , first , uh , to really have a look at {disfmarker} at the speech {pause} {vocalsound} from these databases because , well , we tried several thing , but we did not really look {vocalsound} at what what 's happening , and {vocalsound} where is the noise , and\nProfessor D:OK .\nPhD A:Eh\nProfessor D:It 's a novel idea . Look at the data . OK .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:Or more generally , I guess , what {disfmarker} what is causing the degradation .\nPhD A:Yeah , yeah . Actually , there is one thing that {disfmarker} well {pause} Um , generally we {disfmarker} we think that {vocalsound} most of the errors are within phoneme classes , and so I think it could be interesting to {disfmarker} to see if it {disfmarker} I don't think it 's still true when we add noise , and {vocalsound} so we have {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when {disfmarker} when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech . And probably , there is much more {pause} between classes errors for noisy speech .\nProfessor D:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:And {vocalsound} so , um Yeah , so perhaps we could have a {disfmarker} a large gain , eh , just by looking at improving the , uh , recognition , not of phonemes , but of phoneme classes , simply .\nProfessor D:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:And {vocalsound} which is a s a s a simpler problem , perhaps , but {disfmarker} which is perhaps important for noisy speech .\nProfessor D:The other thing that strikes me , just looking at these numbers is , just taking the best cases , I mean , some of these , of course , even with all of our {disfmarker} our wonderful processing , still are horrible kinds of numbers . But just take the best case , the well - matched {pause} uh , German case after {disfmarker} er well - matched Danish after we {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:the kind of numbers we 're getting are about eight or nine {pause} uh {pause} p percent {pause} error {pause} per digit .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor D:This is obviously not usable ,\nPhD A:No .\nProfessor D:right ?\nPhD A:Sure .\nProfessor D:I mean , if you have ten digits for a phone number {comment} I mean , every now and then you 'll get it right . I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh , {vocalsound} um So , I mean , the other thing is that , uh {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} a and {disfmarker} and also , um {pause} part of what 's nice about this is that this is , uh , {vocalsound} um {pause} a realistic {disfmarker} almost realistic database . I mean , it 's still not people who are really trying to accomplish something , but {disfmarker} but , uh , within the artificial setup , it isn't noise artificially added , you know , simulated , uh , additive noise .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:It 's real noise condition . And , um , {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the training {disfmarker} the training , I guess , is always done on the close talking\nPhD A:No , actually {disfmarker} actually the well - matched condition {pause} is {pause} still quite di still quite difficult .\nProfessor D:No ?\nPhD A:I mean , it 's {disfmarker} they have all these data from the close mike and from the distant mike , {vocalsound} from different driving condition , open window , closed window ,\nProfessor D:Yeah .\nPhD A:and they take all of this and they take seventy percent , I think , for training and thirty percent for testing .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:So , training is done {vocalsound} on different conditions and different microphones , and testing also is done {pause} on different microphone and conditions . So , probably if we only take the close microphones , {vocalsound} I guess the results should be much much better than this .\nProfessor D:I see .\nPhD A:Mmm .\nProfessor D:Oh , OK ,\nPhD A:Uh\nProfessor D:that explains it partially . Wha - what about i in {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nPhD A:Yeah , so {disfmarker} there is this , the mismatched is , um {pause} the same kind of thing ,\nProfessor D:go ahead .\nPhD A:but {pause} the driving conditions , I mean the speed and the kind of road , is different for training and testing , is that right ?\nPhD E:Yeah .\nPhD A:And the last condition is close microphone for training and distant for testing . Yeah .\nProfessor D:Uh , OK ,\nPhD A:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s so {disfmarker}\nProfessor D:so I see . So , yeah , so the high {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} right {disfmarker} so the highly mismatched {vocalsound} case {pause} is in some sense a good model for what we 've been , you know , typically talking about when we talk about additive noise in {disfmarker} And so {disfmarker} and i i k it does correspond to a realistic situation in the sense that , {vocalsound} um , people might really be trying to , uh , call out telephone numbers or some or something like that , in {disfmarker} in their cars\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:and they 're trying to connect to something .\nPhD A:Mmm .\nProfessor D:Um\nPhD A:Actually , yeah , it 's very close to clean speech training because , well , because the close microphone {vocalsound} and noisy speech testing ,\nProfessor D:Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A:yeah . Mmm .\nProfessor D:Yeah . And the well - matched condition {pause} is what you might imagine that you might be able to approach , if you know that this is the application . You 're gonna record a bunch on people in cars and so forth , and do these training . And then , uh , when y you sell it to somebody , they will be a different person with a different car , and so on . So it 's {disfmarker} this is a an optim somewhat optimistic view on it , uh , so , you know , the real thing is somewhere in between the two .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:Uh , uh , but\nPhD A:But the {disfmarker} I mean , the {pause} th th\nProfessor D:Even the optimistic one is\nPhD A:it doesn't work .\nProfessor D:Yeah ,\nPhD A:It {disfmarker}\nProfessor D:right . Right , it doesn't work . So , in a way , that 's , you know , that 's sort of the dominant thing is that even , say on the development set stuff that we saw , the , uh , the numbers that , uh , that Alcatel was getting when choosing out the best single numbers , {vocalsound} it was just {disfmarker} you know , it wasn't good enough for {disfmarker} for {pause} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} for a real system .\nPhD A:Mmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , {vocalsound} um So , uh , we still have stuff to do .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:Uh , and , uh I don't know So , looking at the data , where , you know {disfmarker} what 's the {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's th what 's characteristic i e yeah , I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good thing . Does a any you have any thoughts about what else {vocalsound} y you 're thinking that you didn't get to that you would like to do if you had more time ? Uh\nPhD E:Oh , f a lot of thing . Because we trying a lot of s {pause} thing , and we doesn't work , {vocalsound} we remove these . Maybe {vocalsound} we trying again with the articulatory feature . I don't know exactly because we tried {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} one experiment that doesn't work . Um , forgot it , something {pause} I don't know exactly\nProfessor D:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:because , tsk {comment} {vocalsound} maybe do better some step the general , {vocalsound} eh , diagram .\nProfessor D:Mm - hmm .\nPhD E:I don't know exactly s to think what we can improve .\nProfessor D:Yeah , cuz a lot of time it 's true , there were a lot of times when we 've tried something and it didn't work right away , even though we had an intuition that there should be something there . And so then we would just stop it . Um And , uh , one of the things {disfmarker} I don't remember the details on , but I remember at some point , when you were working with a second stream , and you tried a low - pass filtering to cepstrum , in some case you got {disfmarker}\nPhD E:MSG Yeah .\nProfessor D:Well , but it was {comment} an MSG - like thing , but it wasn't MSG , right ? Uh , you {disfmarker} y I think in some case you got some little improvement , but it was , you know , sort of a small improvement , and it was a {disfmarker} a big added complication , so you dropped it . But , um , that was just sort of one try , right ? You just took one filter , threw it there ,\nPhD A:Yeah ,\nProfessor D:right ? And it seems to me that , um , if that is an important idea , which , you know , might be , that one could work at it for a while , as you 're saying .\nPhD A:Hmm .\nProfessor D:And , uh Uh , and you had , you know , you had the multi - band things also , and , you know , there was issue of that .\nPhD A:Yeah ,\nProfessor D:Um , Barry 's going to be , uh , continuing working on multi - band things as well .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:We were just talking about , um , {vocalsound} some , uh , some work that we 're interested in . Kind of inspired by the stuff by Larry Saul with the , uh {pause} uh , learning articulatory feature in {disfmarker} I think , in the case of his paper {disfmarker} with sonorance based on , uh , multi - band information where you have a {disfmarker} a combination of gradient learning an and , uh , EM .\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:Um , and {pause} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um , so , I think that , you know , this is a , uh {disfmarker} this is a neat data set . Um , and then , uh , as we mentioned before , we also have the {disfmarker} the new , uh , digit set coming up from recordings in this room . So , there 's a lot of things to work with . Um and , uh what I like about it , in a way , is that , uh , the results are still so terrible . Uh {pause} {vocalsound} Uh {pause} {vocalsound} I mean , they 're much better than they were , you know . We 're talking about thirty to sixty percent , uh , error rate reduction . That 's {disfmarker} that 's really great stuff to {disfmarker} to do that in relatively short time . But even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that {disfmarker} that , uh , no one could really use it . So , um I think that 's great that {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} and y also because again , it 's not something {disfmarker} sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something {disfmarker} we take a very {disfmarker} Uh , at one point , uh , Brian and I went downstairs into the {disfmarker} the basement where it was {disfmarker} it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant and we {disfmarker} we made some recordings there . And then we {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we , uh {disfmarker} uh , made a simulation of the {disfmarker} of the room acoustics there and {disfmarker} and applied it to other things ,\nPhD A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D:and uh But it was all pretty artificial , and {disfmarker} and , you know , how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversations in this very reverberant hallway ? Um {pause} So , uh {pause} This is what 's nice about the Aurora data and the data here , is that {disfmarker} is that it 's sort of a realistic room situation {pause} uh , acoustics {disfmarker} acoustic situation , both terms in noise and reflections , and so on and n n And , uh , uh , with something that 's still relatively realistic , it 's still very very hard to do very well . So Yeah .\nPhD A:Yeah , so d well Actually , this is {disfmarker} tha that 's why we {disfmarker} well , it 's a different kind of data . We 're not {disfmarker} we 're not used to work with this kind of data . That 's why we should have a loo more closer look at what 's going on .\nProfessor D:Yeah .\nPhD E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:Um Yeah . So this would be the first thing , and then , of course , try to {disfmarker} well , {vocalsound} kind of debug what was wrong , eh , when we do Aurora test on the MSG {pause} particularly , and on the multi - band .\nProfessor D:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD A:Uh\nProfessor D:Yeah . Yeah . No , I {disfmarker} I think there 's lots of {disfmarker} lots of good things to do with this . So Um So let 's {disfmarker} I guess {pause} You were gonna say something else ? Oh , OK . What do you think ?\nPhD C:About\nProfessor D:Anything\nPhD C:About other experiments ? Uh , now , I 'm interested in , um , uh {pause} looking at the experiments where you use , um {pause} uh , data from multiple languages to train the neural net . And I don't know how far , or if you guys even had a chance to try that , but {pause} that would be some it 'd be interesting to me .\nPhD A:Yeah , but\nProfessor D:S b\nPhD A:Again , it 's the kind of {disfmarker} of thing that , uh , we were thin thinking {disfmarker} thinking that it would work , but it didn't work . And , eh , so there is kind of {disfmarker} of {pause} not a bug , but something wrong in what we are doing , perhaps .\nProfessor D:Yeah .\nPhD C:Right . Right .\nPhD A:Uh , something wrong , perhaps in the {disfmarker} just in the {disfmarker} the fact that the labels are {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Right .\nPhD A:well\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:What worked best is the hand - labeled data .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nPhD A:Um Uh , so , yeah . I don't know if we can get some hand - labeled data from other languages .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD A:It 's not so easy to find .\nPhD C:Right .\nPhD A:But {pause} that would be something interesting t to {disfmarker} to see .\nPhD C:Yeah , yeah .\nProfessor D:Yeah . Also , uh , {vocalsound} I mean , there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data . So one form of different data was {disfmarker} is from different languages , but the other Well , i in fact , uh , m in those experiments it wasn't so much combining multiple nets , it was a single net that had different\nPhD A:Yeah .\nProfessor D:So , first thing is would it be better if they were multiple nets , for some reason ? Second thing is , never mind the different languages , just having acoustic conditions rather than training them all up in one , would it be helpful to have different ones ? So , um That was a question that was kind of raised by Mike Shire 's thesis , and on {disfmarker} in that case in terms of reverberation . Right ? That {disfmarker} that sometimes it might be better to do that . But , um , {vocalsound} I don't think we know for sure . So , um Right . So , next week , we , uh , won't meet because you 'll be in Europe . Whe - when are you two getting back ?\nPhD E:Um , I 'm\nPhD A:You on Friday or S on Saturday or {pause} ?\nPhD E:Sunday\nPhD A:S oh yeah , Sunday , yeah .\nPhD E:because it 's {disfmarker} it 's less expensive , the price {disfmarker} the price the ticket .\nPhD C:\nProfessor D:Yeah , that 's right . You 've gotta S have a Saturday overnight , right ?\nPhD A:I 'll be back on Tuesday .\nProfessor D:Tuesday .\nPhD C:Where {disfmarker} where 's the meeting ?\nProfessor D:Uh , Amsterdam , I think , yeah ?\nPhD A:Yeah , Amsterdam .\nPhD C:Uh - huh .\nProfessor D:Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yep . Um {pause} So , we 'll skip next week , and we 'll meet two weeks from now . And , uh , I guess the main topic will be , uh , you telling us what happened .\nPhD A:Yeah .\nPhD E:Yeah .\nProfessor D:Uh , so Yeah , well , if we don't have an anything else to discuss , we should , uh , turn off the machine and then say the real nasty things .\nPhD C:Should we do digits first ?\nPhD A:Yeah .\nGrad B:Oh , yeah , digits .\nProfessor D:Oh yeah , digits ! Yeah . Good point . Yeah , good thinking . Why don't you go ahead .\nPhD C:OK . OK .\n",
        "summary": "The project was finally coming to a conclusion and the team was getting ready to share their results. They achieved an error rate reduction for the task, but the error rate in itself was still significant. The team also had to think about how they could make their model efficient for it to be deployed as they continue with future research. They discussed some new directions and were reminded that while the initial phase was over, much work lied ahead of them.",

        "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , however , um there are some changes that I've got from on high\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that um are a bit uh {disfmarker} well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh {vocalsound} this is for a specific television .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So the all in one idea goes out the window . And {vocalsound} they require that the uh\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:actually I'll get to that at the end {gap} point number four , um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . So um , presentations , were you {disfmarker} anybody got , raring to go ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Raring to go ? Okay . Good stuff . Mm .\nMarketing:Um . So how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh I need to plug you in . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:S {gap}\nProject Manager:Just about .\nUser Interface:Wow . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's a inspired design .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sh do you want me to hold it ?\nProject Manager:Uh there we go , just screw 'em on in . Gonna have to swap them round so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So , after that ?\nProject Manager:now , it was function F_ eight .\nMarketing:F_ eight . {vocalsound} f oh sorry F_ eight .\nProject Manager:That's the wee blue one . Blue one F_ eight .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Should do it , good one .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah . Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure .\nProject Manager:Hold on , sorry . {gap} and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah . Uh actually , sorry I have to see the other {gap} , sorry .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Sorry , uh .\nMarketing:Yeah , thank you .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? Then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:P press F_ five to start it first .\nMarketing:Sorry . Okay . Yeah , I can , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Jesus .\nMarketing:Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . And what we got was , we found that {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . They are not so good looking . So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available {disfmarker} uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls .\nProject Manager:Excellent .\nMarketing:Then {disfmarker} {gap} And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . So we have to take care of this fact also . Then . Uh it was function I want to go to .\nProject Manager:Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape .\nMarketing:Uh , escape , okay thank you . Then if we look at this slide ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:uh these are in your shared documents , you can see ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:like {disfmarker} Uh , sorry .\nUser Interface:So , sorry {disfmarker} I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? Or is {disfmarker} are you coming on to that ?\nMarketing:Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales .\nUser Interface:Okay . So these percentages are are what ?\nMarketing:Yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , I can open it in another way .\nProject Manager:Okay . Speech recognition .\nMarketing:Uh , yes . If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five ,\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . So we should look {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm . We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . {gap}\nMarketing:Yeah . We can look at that that factor also , so yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm , mm .\nMarketing:So , and {disfmarker} {gap}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Fifteen to twe\nMarketing:Yes . I think so . Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people {disfmarker} consumers could easily learn . They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . So um this is all about\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:uh market potential by me .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Uh , yes , th thank you .\nProject Manager:Okay , thank you . Um , {vocalsound} follow on with Helen ? Yeah please .\nUser Interface:Yep , sure , that's cool , um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah we have to take that {gap} out .\nProject Manager:Oh , so we do yeah .\nMarketing:Sorry .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Fun and games .\nMarketing:Sorry .\nProject Manager:Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough .\nMarketing:Uh sorry , I have {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well .\nMarketing:Brian , this one also I {gap} . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Thank you very much Brian .\nUser Interface:I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay .\nMarketing:If you want me to help , yeah .\nUser Interface:Um , yep .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ?\nMarketing:Uh F_ eight . Function F_ eight .\nProject Manager:Function F_ eight .\nUser Interface:Oh right .\nMarketing:Mm s .\nUser Interface:Okay , cool .\nMarketing:It's not coming . Function F_ eight , okay .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . No signal . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Computer .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Computer adjusting , yeah .\nProject Manager:There you go .\nUser Interface:Okay . Cool .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh F_ five .\nUser Interface:F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ?\nMarketing:Escape .\nProject Manager:Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing .\nUser Interface:Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also {disfmarker} I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ?\nProject Manager:Uh just a left uh\nUser Interface:The arrow ? Okay .\nProject Manager:left mouse button .\nUser Interface:So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . Um and what people {disfmarker} fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface:So um what they like and what they find fashionable .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And ergonomics , we said um , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but um maybe that comes up , I don't know .\nProject Manager:That can come under Arlo as well .\nUser Interface:And the findings , well the basic {disfmarker} that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .\nProject Manager:Uh .\nUser Interface:That's what people want to do . Um , so they need to be included , um , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . I don't know how to get to them ,\nProject Manager:Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} do I press F_ five is it ? {gap} escape ? Oh okay , cool . I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh okay .\nUser Interface:These are two leading um remote controls at the moment .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:You know they're grey , they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do ,\nProject Manager:{gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and they don't look very exciting at all . Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:um , but there you go , that's what we're up against ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and I think we can do much better than that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We hope so .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Of course . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um hang on . F_ five ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:okay , sorry . Personal preferences . Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um\nProject Manager:{gap} Yeah , particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh . And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more um {vocalsound} not as uh computery and\nProject Manager:Organic {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think . {vocalsound} Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent {disfmarker} fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons ,\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks .\nProject Manager:Sales , {gap} . Okay .\nUser Interface:Um , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah it's like a , yeah . {vocalsound} It's {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that ,\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time .\nUser Interface:so maybe we forget about that . It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Exactly . Yeah .\nUser Interface:um which {vocalsound} does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Easy finder with the a whistle function or something ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And I think that , yep , that's it .\nProject Manager:That's cool .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling ,\nUser Interface:Okay ? Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? Um , or if {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:is that a function we want in the remote ?\nProject Manager:Um , do you have trouble whistling ?\nUser Interface:Um , I haven't been able to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Really ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it just\nProject Manager:Ooh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I suppose that's true .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , yeah\nProject Manager:Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the\nUser Interface:or some sort of voice {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's costly though .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ?\nProject Manager:Sounds good .\nUser Interface:Yeah , something .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , uh let me set this up . So I plug it in , press F_ five ? Function F_ five ?\nProject Manager:Function F_ eight for the um the uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Or function F_ eight ? Okay .\nUser Interface:Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . I think it's {vocalsound} uh just to lock it in . It's got it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um . {vocalsound} So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:um so it's good you went first ,\nProject Manager:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Let's remember that .\nIndustrial Designer:Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and uh {vocalsound} he mentioned that they're not fun to use . And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote ,\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , yeah , that's true .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well maybe you could have a um hmm {vocalsound} tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . Um .\nProject Manager:Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um {vocalsound} and not computery ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:right , so more low tech and not too many buttons .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right um , and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains {disfmarker} Or uh or a high speed train .\nProject Manager:Ah is that what that is ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well that's cool . If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . So ,\nUser Interface:Yeah sure .\nIndustrial Designer:I figured , just put 'em all together .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and and it's a {disfmarker} you know , for the the cowboy in all of us {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well I like that design . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Right . So I think I I missed the budget thing ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it was fifty million Euros ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? Right . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , not a problem .\nMarketing:Fifty million was uh prof\nProject Manager:Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g {vocalsound}\nMarketing:As a profit .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers .\nProject Manager:gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:um , we don't wanna have it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:Or a little base station or something , {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . Um , I hadn't thought of that . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's {disfmarker} that's cheaper to just provide batteries .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it ,\nUser Interface:A battery in it , kinda .\nProject Manager:so I don't think it'd up up the price that much .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , so so {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:the unirs the user interface\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:behind our product .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um {vocalsound} you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . {vocalsound} And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so {disfmarker} uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .\nUser Interface:Mm . Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options .\nMarketing:Yeah , me too .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh okay . And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:Mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's all I got .\nProject Manager:'Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh that's tight .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is {disfmarker} let's see , I'll find it myself , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Ta\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in .\nProject Manager:nah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Just push it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . Um , {vocalsound} dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .\nUser Interface:Corporate colour .\nProject Manager:Yellow .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yellow . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I presume . Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh {disfmarker} I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh , where am I ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Uh , {vocalsound} now , we had as listed options we had\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:We'll use the the basic functions for a television . No teletext . Um {vocalsound} okay hold on .\nUser Interface:Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap .\nProject Manager:Not enough buttons you mean ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or it looks like we're just cutting on the um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm . On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff .\nProject Manager:I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , okay . Okay , cool .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send\nMarketing:About cost .\nProject Manager:some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote {disfmarker} teletext option in a remote control .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap} {vocalsound} Okay um {gap} . So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the {disfmarker} a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um {vocalsound} said people didn't like . Although I guess if there's a sort of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um {vocalsound} it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ?\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh .\nUser Interface:Glow in the dark material I was thinking .\nProject Manager:Okay . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think .\nMarketing:Uh may I say something about {gap} ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Often lost s was that ,\nMarketing:yeah are lost\nProject Manager:Lost , yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control ,\nProject Manager:That's cool .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm ,\nMarketing:and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales ,\nProject Manager:That's cool .\nUser Interface:mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so we should take it into consideration also .\nProject Manager:Okay , cool .\nIndustrial Designer:Well hmm .\nProject Manager:Um speech recognition I take it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I don't , I've {disfmarker} I know of no products um that use speech recognition well .\nIndustrial Designer:They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a {disfmarker} some basic speech recognition on it . You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel .\nProject Manager:Really ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one {gap} .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but if you can work around that that noise problem {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:Well what about {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or {vocalsound} something\nProject Manager:Ah , that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:If you find if y\nIndustrial Designer:Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:What you could do then would be you have uh {vocalsound} a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s .\nUser Interface:Mm . Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker\nProject Manager:That we should just stick on , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:which {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That comes with our remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , right .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , right . Um . {vocalsound} Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It might do us out of a job .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . Um so I think rather than {disfmarker} and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:so I th\nUser Interface:And the expense .\nProject Manager:yeah and expense and the time .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So I think if we're going to go {disfmarker} well I mean like the thing about the {disfmarker} there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um , but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? Is that {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nUser Interface:Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Contrast contra well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So if it's dow it's d uh yeah . Or if it's down under the couch cushions\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:um which is where I usually find mine .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Okay , well we can use {disfmarker} we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially ,\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:um if we're gonna have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:'cause what I thought , main {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um slogan .\nUser Interface:Slogan , yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .\nUser Interface:Right . Mm-hmm . 'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um {vocalsound} uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .\nUser Interface:That was more of a a gimmick .\nProject Manager:Do you think ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then .\nUser Interface:Yeah , unnecessary . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um , okay so scratch that . Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the {disfmarker} is that far too expensive ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:They're pretty fragile .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ?\nProject Manager:Um no , I mean {gap} that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . Um . {gap} So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} you were finding out about teletext .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:If you could find out that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she {disfmarker} they wi\nProject Manager:Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:um expensive ,\nUser Interface:Yeah you think so ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits .\nProject Manager:no ? Oh right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system ,\nProject Manager:Is it not the circuits that cost {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:like a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ {vocalsound} the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} Five minutes . Okay . Decisions . Uh , votes , let's vote . Who wants T_F_T_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No-one does .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , that's cool .\nProject Manager:Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head ,\nUser Interface:Um\nProject Manager:programmability .\nMarketing:Glow in dark .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh o okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {gap}\nProject Manager:And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , so . Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . So , it just helps me summarize them .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:Here ? Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And um I'll put any {disfmarker} {gap} I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And where is it sorry ?\nProject Manager:Uh pro uh project documents .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So it should be when you save\nProject Manager:On A_M_I_ scenario controller .\nIndustrial Designer:on your desktop , so it goes save as , or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh {gap} .\nMarketing:Uh it is in shared documents ?\nIndustrial Designer:And then uh hit that little folder up thing again .\nProject Manager:Where am I ?\nMarketing:Projoct uh projector .\nIndustrial Designer:Again .\nProject Manager:Project documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well .\nIndustrial Designer:All the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . Right and then project documents .\nUser Interface:Okay , cool .\nMarketing:Hmm . It is not giving anything .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Shared documents .\nProject Manager:And I will tr {gap} getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Did you get my email ? Okay .\nProject Manager:I did {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Just making sure .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . Um , a bit more {vocalsound} durable and that can also be ergonomic\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The rubber rather than {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Wow .\nMarketing:Um but we have to take care like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But we have to take care of our children also if they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . So , whatever material we use it should be {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh no , ethics , {vocalsound} that's gonna cost us money . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So {vocalsound} we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , safety .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as {disfmarker} it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I dunno , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We could go comp yeah .\nProject Manager:It sme {vocalsound} smells good for children . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it's got the thing on the inside .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That sounds ,\nUser Interface:That's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:And then ch children will love it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yellow , yellow ball . Right .\nUser Interface:Yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ?\nProject Manager:Please God no . Um . Well , I wouldn't th I mean ,\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so I think just having it\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow {gap} with the logo in it .\nProject Manager:surrounding the logo .\nUser Interface:Having a little bit . Okay cool . Mm mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , okay .\nProject Manager:And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Cool .\nProject Manager:what was it ? We put {vocalsound} we put fashion into {disfmarker} Whoops , it's not working . Can't believe I've forgotten it {gap} . We put the fashion in electronics . {vocalsound} I bet that'll catch on well .\nUser Interface:Oh yeah , that's a good one that . Yeah so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , any last\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Twelve thirty .\nProject Manager:worries , queries ? Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} S s {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:I know what you're thinking .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay then , lunchtime , yay .\nMarketing:That's good .\nProject Manager:Okay , that felt a bit more like a {disfmarker} something with order and and reason to it than the last one .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This is quite fun actually .\nUser Interface:Wow .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Has anybo oh .\nProject Manager:I really don't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Has anybody pressed okay , it vibrates . It's pretty cool .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Check here .\nProject Manager:Wow you've {gap} your first page .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah I've been using up the pages .\nProject Manager:I was just writing really big . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , got small writing . I don't wanna waste it .\nProject Manager:I've finished the meeting now .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Another questionnaire .\nProject Manager:Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\n",
        "summary": "This meeting took up the discussion from the last one. They specified the ideas brought up last time and adapted them according to the market potentials and budget limits. Marketing first reported their findings of market potentials. Altogether, they summarized four conclusions: (1) consumers were willing to spend more for fancy products (2) the current products didn't always match users' operating behaviours (3) a lot of buttons weren't used (4) they were not fun to use. Then, the team came up with a novel feature of automatic speech recognition to retrieve the remotes. In the latter half of the meeting, the team decided that the following functions would be for the new remotes: speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design, programmability, glowing in dark, and integrating the logo and slogan.",

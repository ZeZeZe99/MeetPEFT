{"id": 1, "conversations": "Marketing:{vocalsound} That went well , thank you .\nProject Manager:That's great .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing:Perfect .\nProject Manager:Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it {disfmarker} 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . {vocalsound} And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll go first .\nProject Manager:Alright Nathan ,\nMarketing:Go ahead .\nProject Manager:take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nIndustrial Designer:No Nathan's fine .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Good .\nIndustrial Designer:It's either Nathan or participant two .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mister participant two that is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um ,\nProject Manager:Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker} Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look {disfmarker} if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um {disfmarker} the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So we'll have to look into that .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nProject Manager:What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and just a little note there ,\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Right . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record {disfmarker} if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part {disfmarker} use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nMarketing:Interesting .\nIndustrial Designer:Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} M Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Good call .\nProject Manager:is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Choose it .\nIndustrial Designer:I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nUser Interface:Interesting question .\nIndustrial Designer:'S a bit of a challenge question .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is {disfmarker} I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about {disfmarker} I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some {disfmarker} you know , say our {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind {disfmarker} before we launch {disfmarker} can we see how they're received ?\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker} It's an option , uh but actually there's {disfmarker} I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:which actually might even come into play beforehand ,\nProject Manager:Okay , perfect .\nMarketing:it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .\nProject Manager:Great , thank you very much Nathan .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , you're welcome .\nProject Manager:That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Did you ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:You waiting for me ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Fascinating , compelling even .\nMarketing:I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . {vocalsound} Right . So\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now {disfmarker} basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting {disfmarker} they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um {disfmarker} that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Tomatoes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:a different shape\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:or {vocalsound} okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of {disfmarker} and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I like it , I like it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:uh not something I I've come up with a {gap} though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use {disfmarker} we can use a rubber as part of the case ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:it has a consistency of those stress balls .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Slick , slick .\nUser Interface:Fabulous .\nMarketing:Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new {disfmarker} I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager:Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I like the idea of of rubber too because it's {disfmarker} tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause so many {disfmarker}\nMarketing:True .\nIndustrial Designer:you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .\nMarketing:Very true . Very true .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's like , yep {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Taped with duck tape and what have you ,\nMarketing:Very much so {vocalsound} . Um\nIndustrial Designer:you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .\nProject Manager:it's ubiquitous isn't it ?\nUser Interface:We can have a duck tape casing .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:We could .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It could go with the granola crowd .\nMarketing:but worth a shot .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ah , it could be , it could be ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Great ,\nMarketing:um . Yeah that's what I know .\nProject Manager:thanks for that Sarah .\nMarketing:No problem .\nProject Manager:Ron ?\nUser Interface:Phew . Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look .\nProject Manager:Yeah\nUser Interface:Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um {disfmarker} with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} On the remote control\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:at the {gap} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:right .\nMarketing:Yeah . Very true , very true .\nUser Interface:Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:which I am sure most of you know about .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern {gap} a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your {disfmarker} for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I {disfmarker} again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I can see . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um , again probably not what we're going for\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so I {disfmarker} I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh {disfmarker} our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nMarketing:Mm , right .\nUser Interface:and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:has jokes when it's ready .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager:Great .\nUser Interface:And uh that is about it .\nProject Manager:Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . {vocalsound} Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um {vocalsound} various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?\nMarketing:I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .\nProject Manager:'Kay . 'Kay .\nMarketing:But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:right ?\nIndustrial Designer:My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,\nProject Manager:To produce each one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Per ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah that's just an estimate though .\nMarketing:Piece .\nUser Interface:Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I know\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:You industrial designers . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I know .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:It's fun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?\nProject Manager:Well .\nMarketing:Do we remember ?\nIndustrial Designer:I thought there was some flexibility with that .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:There is , it's just , it is a question of {disfmarker} and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\nMarketing:Can we justify it ?\nProject Manager:Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin {vocalsound} um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's just off the top of my head ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} From the board ,\nIndustrial Designer:it is pending further emails . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager:um , well {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Though I think that's what people would pay for ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's true , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It is the new {disfmarker} it would be in a class of its own .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And that's {disfmarker} to be fair the um the per cent of the market {disfmarker} we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make {disfmarker} I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros ,\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?\nUser Interface:I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh {disfmarker} on the third floor suggested that uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:See if we can cut some corners .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:It's true .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right . It's a starting point anyway , so .\nProject Manager:No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we {disfmarker} yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} our main selling point here .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah 'cause with voice recognition {disfmarker} I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} The voice rec thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean , {vocalsound} if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think we might have to drop the voice rec .\nMarketing:I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,\nMarketing:Price-wise .\nUser Interface:I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice {disfmarker}\nMarketing:True .\nUser Interface:we're using it for our coffee machines already .\nMarketing:We've already got it .\nUser Interface:I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh {disfmarker} guy down the hall . Sounds good .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think if we {disfmarker} we do both the {disfmarker} obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into {disfmarker} it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .\nMarketing:Pretty much .\nUser Interface:I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .\nMarketing:Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Does having both really up our costs ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , 'cause you {disfmarker} you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .\nProject Manager:It's just impossible .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just {disfmarker} it just becomes cost prohibitive . What {disfmarker} which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?\nMarketing:Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .\nIndustrial Designer:I would have to side with that ,\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the {disfmarker} all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well my p {vocalsound} is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Nathan ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would {disfmarker} they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer:and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .\nMarketing:And we're still not {disfmarker} then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:we can stick with what we've already got . In a lot other ways too .\nProject Manager:Okay . So I'm getting {disfmarker} alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay .\nMarketing:I think it's our lower risk option\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:which for right now {disfmarker} we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .\nProject Manager:Okay . Sorted .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\nUser Interface:It's you and me outside a little here . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's {disfmarker} you guys's next step right ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it {disfmarker} what {vocalsound} f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?\nProject Manager:Yes . We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement ,\nProject Manager:Mm . Yep .\nMarketing:like what if {disfmarker} wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,\nUser Interface:Calculator .\nMarketing:Yeah . True . True .\nIndustrial Designer:um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:What do you think Ron ?\nUser Interface:I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Interesting .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\nUser Interface:Just a thought .\nIndustrial Designer:What's the uh idea ?\nUser Interface:Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .\nMarketing:I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Do you think people that are {disfmarker} people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .\nMarketing:True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,\nProject Manager:Well we have to have buttons on it too as well .\nMarketing:right .\nProject Manager:But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have {disfmarker} or like um {vocalsound} who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .\nMarketing:With the bu yeah .\nProject Manager:And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .\nIndustrial Designer:I think , I think you're on to something\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is {disfmarker} would be good , even though {disfmarker} and hand-held the same time .\nMarketing:True . Way to go .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .\nMarketing:Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:you know like that little pod looking thing ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , those are nice .\nUser Interface:Exactly .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I mean a nice {disfmarker} although we do um wh uh is {disfmarker} I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:and get back to it\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh {disfmarker} using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:um you know\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit {disfmarker} gives just a bit . You know\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Just kind of the squishy feel .\nMarketing:Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it {disfmarker} literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good .\nMarketing:Handy .\nProject Manager:Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , {vocalsound} um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We'll have more of an idea when the prototype {disfmarker} have more of a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and I'm just having to guess .\nProject Manager:we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . {vocalsound} Um , so\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we {disfmarker} wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um {vocalsound} a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .\nMarketing:Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Like maybe have menu things .\nMarketing:Take precedence ,\nIndustrial Designer:If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\nMarketing:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .\nMarketing:And they slide .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah\nMarketing:True ,\nProject Manager:we've also got the the me the thing of ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:we're still not making it easier then .\nProject Manager:if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:True .\nProject Manager:B But no I mean\nMarketing:Fair enough .\nProject Manager:we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it {disfmarker} say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um {disfmarker} like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Yeah it's just a scroll .\nProject Manager:and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So are we gonna {disfmarker} are we talking {disfmarker} we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well it seems like {vocalsound} I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um {disfmarker} stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um {vocalsound} rubber for the outside case\nMarketing:Yeah . Probably .\nProject Manager:we might as well stick with that um .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nMarketing:Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are {disfmarker} that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay , um . {vocalsound} We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling {vocalsound} um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Right , particularly in technological fields ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so that's exactly where we're headed .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nUser Interface:Well what are we actually doing ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right .\nUser Interface:What were {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but {disfmarker} yeah , whatever .\nProject Manager:I wasn't ? Oh , my bad {vocalsound} um sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No , don't worry about it .\nProject Manager:The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nUser Interface:Sure .\nProject Manager:any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} cool ?\nIndustrial Designer:So\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer:Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a tough situation ,\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:but obviously having more cases also costs more so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\nIndustrial Designer:There's an idea .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the {gap} thing .\nUser Interface:And again copying iMac's kind of {disfmarker} for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .\nMarketing:Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on {vocalsound} uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda {disfmarker} yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh {disfmarker} I'd like {disfmarker} Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} using um {vocalsound} prototype building materials um {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh excellent yeah .\nProject Manager:So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?\nMarketing:Cool .\nIndustrial Designer:That sounds good .\nUser Interface:Fabulous .\nProject Manager:Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .\nMarketing:Cool .\n", "summary": "The whole meeting was about a detailed prototype of the remote control. As before, this meeting also began with personal presentations. The Industrial Design focused on the components of the remote control, including the energy source, the buttons and the materials, while the User Interface suggested to use voice recognition technique and add secured or hidden programming onto the touch screen. Then the problem came that if they would like to make it so complex, they would go beyond the budget and have to raise the cost. Thus they decided to simplify some functions and buttons. Before the meeting ended, they also discussed the shape of the remote control.", "length": 11996}
{"id": 2, "conversations": "Industrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Are you sure I got it all {disfmarker} head's kinda small .\nUser Interface:How're we placed in terms of the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . {gap}\nUser Interface:alright .\nMarketing:We're okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Guess I should probably try to sit up straight .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Like that ? Okay , cool .\nMarketing:We're good ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , I think mine's fallen off .\nUser Interface:It fell {disfmarker} That's why .\nMarketing:I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh okay .\nUser Interface:Ah .\nProject Manager:Okay ? {vocalsound} Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint .\nIndustrial Designer:Wow .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Very official .\nProject Manager:Yeah , well , you know , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it {vocalsound} right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um {vocalsound} We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I {gap} guess you know game or something um {vocalsound} in real life um so yeah basically I want to {disfmarker} I'm just gonna {disfmarker} you got {disfmarker} of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um {vocalsound} uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . {vocalsound} Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um {vocalsound} y is\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You're just gonna believe me ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:we'll go from there .\nProject Manager:Exactly . Um I mean\nMarketing:Fair enough .\nProject Manager:obvi if if you guys {disfmarker} if if at the same time if you {disfmarker} like logically if something doesn't {disfmarker} like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like\nMarketing:Prove it\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} yeah yeah exactly\nMarketing:yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:so , 'cause we're {disfmarker} what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well {vocalsound} um . And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um {vocalsound} uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you can {disfmarker} this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , that's fine .\nUser Interface:Sure .\nMarketing:Works for me .\nProject Manager:Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that {vocalsound} we're totally {disfmarker} we're making a remote control which is thrilling\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the {disfmarker} in real life I dunno if you guys uh {vocalsound} checked the um {vocalsound} uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . {vocalsound} Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um {vocalsound} um the other designer that I can't remember ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um {vocalsound} the Industrial Designer\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:hey right on alright ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:getting into it um\nMarketing:There you go .\nProject Manager:to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be {disfmarker} you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um {vocalsound} I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down {disfmarker} I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you {disfmarker} if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . Oh , we skipped introductions . Nice . I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I'm Marty ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . Um yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . Marketing ,\nProject Manager:Expert {vocalsound}\nMarketing:yeah Expert . Expert .\nProject Manager:Don't play yourself down . Expert {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Fine . That's me .\nUser Interface:I'm Ron . I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm Nathan , I'm from California , and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology .\nProject Manager:Where did you go to uni Nathan ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} U_C_L_A_ .\nProject Manager:Oh brilliant . Cool . My little brother goes there .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Right so desert island discs .\nMarketing:So .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ?\nProject Manager:Well I'll t i\nMarketing:I'm waiting to know .\nProject Manager:no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut\nMarketing:Fair enough .\nProject Manager:like I am like Smallville terrible television show\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but I happen to love it ,\nMarketing:Oh , Smallville .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it's rubbish but I love it .\nMarketing:I went to high school with Tom Willing actually .\nProject Manager:T the the main c the main character ?\nMarketing:The guy . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Wow . Is he a wanker ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} Very much so . Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless .\nProject Manager:He looks really tall , like he's gotta be like six six .\nMarketing:Yeah . He is a big guy . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Um okay so {vocalsound} I really like Jeff Buckley . You guys heard of Jeff Buckley ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have . Um {vocalsound} and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's a r\nMarketing:Good call .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think . It's kinda weird . Anyway\nMarketing:Interesting .\nProject Manager:yeah . Yeah , you're like press and it's {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Kinda cool .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You'll see . Alright so um\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want .\nMarketing:I guess I'll go next then .\nProject Manager:Right on .\nUser Interface:Go for it .\nMarketing:Okay . Don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . Okay . This is basically just pen practice huh ?\nProject Manager:W\nMarketing:Okay . Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here . Um . Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:local Michigan folk singer ,\nProject Manager:Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:Wow .\nMarketing:really lame\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and uh uh what else did I bring with me ? Probably classical , to totally geek it out ,\nProject Manager:Okay yeah yeah .\nMarketing:yeah I think . And my family guy D_V_D_s\nProject Manager:Well yeah .\nMarketing:but we don't need to write that one down .\nProject Manager:Oh , family guy . Isn't h has h\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:do you watch the new season ?\nMarketing:No . Are you getting it online ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think I'm gonna start downloading it\nMarketing:or is it on sky ?\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , that'd be nice .\nUser Interface:Alright . Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_ . Anybody ?\nProject Manager:Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nUser Interface:No ? {gap} no ?\nMarketing:'Fraid not .\nUser Interface:Afro beat orchestra , very cool .\nProject Manager:Afro beat orchestra ? Very cool . Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Sounds nice .\nUser Interface:Fift S\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:they like fifteen members from Brooklyn . Um and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium , in Brussels in April first .\nProject Manager:Wow .\nMarketing:Exciting .\nUser Interface:Yeah . It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways .\nMarketing:That'd be {gap} .\nUser Interface:Um thing I love about Edinburgh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh . I didn't even read those . Oops . I shouldn't admit that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for . It's they're designed specifically to ignore . I {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} th brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , wow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's the five by five , I can't read that much .\nProject Manager:Ah yes yes yes okay I see that .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah\nProject Manager:Vomit . Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:oh it's so horrible .\nProject Manager:Street pizza .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Love um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's so brilliant . {vocalsound} I've seen more urine in this city than ever before ,\nMarketing:Oh my God .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I just came from Glasgow\nProject Manager:I mean {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Seriously ?\nUser Interface:and I'm um happy to say that there's the {disfmarker} there's the same quantity approximately .\nIndustrial Designer:There's more vomit there .\nUser Interface:Um .\nProject Manager:It's so minging .\nUser Interface:I w\nMarketing:It really is {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh .\nUser Interface:Does uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright . Yep .\nUser Interface:Ready ? Minging ? Nice .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I'm going local . Going local .\nMarketing:Slide it in there . Yeah .\nProject Manager:I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right .\nMarketing:Yeah fair enough . I've already got more than I can keep track of . And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people ,\nProject Manager:Oh , have you been home yet ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:They'll be like , say something British ,\nMarketing:no .\nProject Manager:and you're like oh shut up family . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I know . I know .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh it should be interesting .\nIndustrial Designer:Let's see .\nMarketing:Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:They're gonna love that one .\nProject Manager:you s you're gonna stay here ?\nMarketing:Probably .\nProject Manager:Wow .\nMarketing:Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager:Bad religion ?\nMarketing:'Cause {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's the music I grew up listening to .\nMarketing:nice .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Of course .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And so there {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh , now I can think of so many other ones .\nProject Manager:Well yeah that's why {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's how it works .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Something I miss about my hometown .\nProject Manager:I miss coffee .\nIndustrial Designer:Burritos\nMarketing:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Burritos .\nUser Interface:Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:that cost less than eight Pounds . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh yeah two two bucks .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Any thing that are like free .\nProject Manager:Where are you from in California by the way ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I grew up in San Diego ,\nProject Manager:Did you really ? What part ?\nIndustrial Designer:but yeah um La Jolla , P_B_ {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah I'm from San Diego as well . Yeah oh man .\nMarketing:Nice . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But really uh I last lived in San Francisco , I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen .\nProject Manager:Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego .\nIndustrial Designer:It's different . 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them .\nMarketing:It must make all the difference . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it really does .\nProject Manager:Well it's it's {vocalsound} i there's other things too there's {disfmarker} you just can't place it\nMarketing:Ah .\nProject Manager:like I {disfmarker} when I went to school in the U_ {disfmarker} in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:like literally two bucks for this massive {disfmarker} I miss\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:yeah good call on that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Where you from in San Diego ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo . So\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:North Park actually if you want to get real specific .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , my grandparents lived on um thirty second .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is ,\nProject Manager:Yes . On university ,\nIndustrial Designer:and\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Cafe Forte {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nProject Manager:Yeah , pretty cool . Small world as we were discussing before .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Especially when we're all from the same general region . Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . You can harness the awesome power\nMarketing:There you go .\nProject Manager:a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s\nIndustrial Designer:Wow .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um right so {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:moving on to not fun stuff {vocalsound} uh project finance .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . {vocalsound} This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . Um so\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . Eur internationally . So {vocalsound} um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . Um so\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s\nMarketing:Makes sense .\nProject Manager:but um you know\nMarketing:Uh .\nProject Manager:I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing . {vocalsound} Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . {vocalsound} Um s right so um just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . Um . {vocalsound} Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um {vocalsound} and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . Um {vocalsound} U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from {disfmarker} in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} what the user's gonna want .\nMarketing:What they're looking for .\nProject Manager:So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like uh so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And negotiate that . Uh .\nProject Manager:yeah well it is {vocalsound} and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . Um any questions , before we get started ?\nUser Interface:I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You mean to like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:For instance like a mobile phone or something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Sounds interesting .\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?\nProject Manager:Well , have a think about it .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I mean\nUser Interface:Yep . Okay .\nProject Manager:I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able\nMarketing:W yeah .\nProject Manager:isn't it . I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of {vocalsound} useful function .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:The clapper . No I mean {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:no , good idea , good idea . We'll see what {disfmarker} see what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Nice . Hot . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I like the little cover thingies .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh y I like that {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um {disfmarker} I don't really have any . Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . Uh project announcement . Ts ts ts {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Not so much .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:All right we'll find them , we're on our own .\nUser Interface:Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ?\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do .\nUser Interface:S does anybody have any initial ideas ?\nProject Manager:I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Good idea . Start your minutes . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah I mean oh yeah right . {vocalsound} So initial ideas . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:or like to have everything on one thing ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:S smaller's better .\nMarketing:you can't tell what they do .\nIndustrial Designer:Simple .\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker} I'm thinking {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design\nMarketing:Yeah . Specific .\nUser Interface:so touch screen design rather than button\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right . That'd be different .\nUser Interface:so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things .\nMarketing:Interesting .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah that's slick\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:isn't it . I mean like {vocalsound} stylist {vocalsound} yeah like a just a\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:True .\nProject Manager:yeah . Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um {vocalsound} uh size and functionality .\nMarketing:Mm . Mm .\nProject Manager:Um and we also {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right . We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Too confusing .\nIndustrial Designer:It's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things .\nProject Manager:I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:of um {vocalsound} so you {disfmarker} like {disfmarker} maybe like an L_ {disfmarker} like a touch screen type of remote ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Possibly .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I don't think one exists .\nMarketing:An interesting option .\nProject Manager:Be a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Needs {disfmarker} it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes .\nMarketing:Yeah . Definitely .\nProject Manager:Yeah all the other universal remotes . Um {vocalsound} I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:I'm pretty sure there is .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:that he just points at his telev any television he wants\nMarketing:That {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:and it'll figure out the {vocalsound} the specifications of it\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and will control it\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Interesting . Okay .\nUser Interface:um so\nMarketing:Awesome .\nUser Interface:I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um all right . So . I li I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . Um .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Um . {vocalsound} Let's see .\nIndustrial Designer:I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah . Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . And {disfmarker} I don't know , like , there's such a problem with losing them ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:so we're gonna have to be careful with what like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh let's see . Um .\nUser Interface:I like the idea of the uh multi plate .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} In in\nMarketing:Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ?\nProject Manager:Think they're just called face plates ?\nMarketing:Isn't there a name for them ?\nProject Manager:I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} something ,\nMarketing:Are they ? I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:uh we'll have to come up with a name ,\nUser Interface:I like .\nIndustrial Designer:patent it .\nUser Interface:We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well .\nMarketing:Yeah . Something really cool .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Leopard print or something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} For those cold winter days . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Leopard print . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .\nMarketing:True .\nProject Manager:Mm . But if we're bundling it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} unless we're selling their telly with the remote .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it .\nIndustrial Designer:True .\nUser Interface:If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either {disfmarker}\nMarketing:True .\nUser Interface:well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um {vocalsound} uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes {vocalsound} ,\nUser Interface:Th\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:could we do something like that ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think so .\nUser Interface:That's cool .\nMarketing:Probably .\nUser Interface:I think we could design into that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Good .\nProject Manager:Um yeah {vocalsound} I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Curves .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty {disfmarker} you know it's pretty expensive\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager:that's black and you know m massive ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .\nMarketing:Mm . Definitely .\nProject Manager:But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Or if you our users in mind , like these {disfmarker} grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's {disfmarker} they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'S true .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?\nProject Manager:Twenty five Euros .\nMarketing:Euros .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Slight difference I guess .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} They're all weaker than {disfmarker} they're all stronger than the Dollar . Although , computer parts , all {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ?\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:Mm-mm .\nProject Manager:They serve um {disfmarker} right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um {vocalsound} project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into .\nMarketing:With half an hour ?\nProject Manager:Um . Yes .\nMarketing:'Kay . Perfect .\nProject Manager:Thanks guys .\nMarketing:Cool .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nUser Interface:Thank you .\n", "summary": "The meeting was about a preliminary idea of new remote control, covering the price, the functions, the appearance and the name. After a brief self-introduction, Project Manager assigned the task. One of the most important issues of the meeting was about the price. Project Manager supposed the product should be sold at 25 euros with a one hundred percent profit. As it would be a multifunctional remote control, the members were confident that it would stand alone. Moving on to the issue of the appearance, the group analyzed the problems of the existing remotes and briefly talked about the user interface as well as came up with a name of the product.", "length": 9772}
{"id": 3, "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay . So welcome back .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation .\nProject Manager:Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But where ?\nProject Manager:What's the name ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What's the name of it ?\nIndustrial Designer:It was about the working of the remote control .\nProject Manager:It's the technical function or the functional requirements .\nIndustrial Designer:Nope .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it .\nProject Manager:Working design .\nIndustrial Designer:But now I don't know where it is . Hmm .\nProject Manager:Working design . What is this ? Product documents .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up .\nIndustrial Designer:One more .\nProject Manager:Up .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . My Documents . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer:What the fuck is this ?\nProject Manager:Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:PowerPoint . Working design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's the empty one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I had one .\nProject Manager:Presentation of working design .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is .\nProject Manager:Save as {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Desktop .\nProject Manager:Project {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Project .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay . Well .\nProject Manager:Save .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Very good .\nIndustrial Designer:A little later but here it is .\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and {vocalsound} I don't get it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Make it .\nProject Manager:Now have ten minutes to tell it .\nIndustrial Designer:Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh oh . Two questions .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ?\nIndustrial Designer:If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .\nProject Manager:Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting .\nProject Manager:Okay so it's the size of the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Just {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've {disfmarker} you need the television , wh which can use it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . But uh I think this {disfmarker} our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ?\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Or is it also for other company {disfmarker} uh for other televisions ?\nProject Manager:I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .\nIndustrial Designer:Then this is an option . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the\nProject Manager:Yeah but I don't {disfmarker} I think it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But {disfmarker} Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And also different things .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Will this will this add to the cost ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh then it won't be {disfmarker} uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers .\nMarketing:Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Not much . 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones .\nProject Manager:Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones .\nIndustrial Designer:Just one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it .\nProject Manager:Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh a p a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah but there are also design cost . I don't think {disfmarker} When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Would you change the cover ?\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe . I wi I won't .\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:N yeah but {disfmarker} I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah it's a good idea . But {disfmarker} If if it {disfmarker} Yeah , I don't {disfmarker} I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it .\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:You're the Project Manager . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . That's it .\nProject Manager:That's clear . {vocalsound} Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer .\nUser Interface:Oh . That's me . Uh {disfmarker} Come on . {gap} . Ah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh {disfmarker} for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh {disfmarker} and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh {disfmarker} We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . {vocalsound} Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ?\nProject Manager:We'll got back on that later .\nUser Interface:Okay yeah . Yeah well the {disfmarker} that was just on my mind .\nMarketing:Yes .\nUser Interface:So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:'Kay , thank you . Then it's your turn , the marketing expert .\nMarketing:Okay . Uh um m Yeah . {vocalsound} Um yeah okay . This bit too far . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I {vocalsound} I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the {gap} we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say {gap} . I will {disfmarker} that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change {vocalsound} I think .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two {disfmarker} several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh {disfmarker} also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um well th uh that's my second point .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um {disfmarker} You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . That were my findings .\nProject Manager:Okay thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I have uh one question .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I think we don't have that in our budget .\nMarketing:Yes .\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Do you think ?\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Like {disfmarker} No . No .\nUser Interface:So it's {disfmarker} Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Just the L_C_D_ ?\nProject Manager:Yes . Only the L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} But we'll come back on that .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Now {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh , go on . What d d d um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .\nMarketing:Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nMarketing:The the requirements you just said ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:maybe we should first have a discussion about that .\nProject Manager:Yes , it's okay .\nMarketing:I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .\nProject Manager:Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , it's not my requirement .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay , we'll just have to do that .\nProject Manager:We have to do this .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . No discussion about it .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay sorry .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:Then uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So what controls do we need ? Who first ?\nUser Interface:Well a power button ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh power .\nUser Interface:Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh mm channel .\nUser Interface:But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .\nProject Manager:Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine .\nUser Interface:Uh volume .\nProject Manager:Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno\nMarketing:Mine ? It's the functional requirements .\nProject Manager:Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh mine .\nProject Manager:Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface:Technical .\nProject Manager:technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .\nIndustrial Designer:To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .\nProject Manager:Yeah that's the channel .\nMarketing:D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?\nProject Manager:Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .\nUser Interface:Mm yes .\nProject Manager:And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .\nProject Manager:On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?\nMarketing:Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .\nProject Manager:Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:we need {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But then we come to the costs .\nProject Manager:N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .\nProject Manager:So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?\nUser Interface:Mute .\nProject Manager:Mute . Maybe in the menu ?\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .\nProject Manager:Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But now we have only the buttons .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No that's for the next phase .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . Good idea .\nProject Manager:Thanks for coming .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\n", "summary": "The team introduced their findings in turns and gradually came to some agreements. First, Industrial Designer introduced the structure of the device and suggested one battery and small size. Meanwhile, Project Manager questioned the cover design since it would not be cheap. Then, User Interface left a question whether the technical function should be basic or multi-functional. After that, Marketing concluded that less important functions should be discarded and the device should be user friendly. Lastly, Project Manager suggested discarding the teletext and asked for ideas about button design.", "length": 7094}
{"id": 4, "conversations": "Project Manager:All hooked up . {vocalsound} Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um {vocalsound} hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Did anyone ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .\nUser Interface:Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there .\nUser Interface:Oh okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?\nUser Interface:Yes , I think so .\nProject Manager:Yep . I'll do that next time . Um {vocalsound} I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent\nUser Interface:Yeah , the last minute , yeah ,\nProject Manager:at the last minute , I'm sorry about that ,\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control {disfmarker} that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You said uh targ target groups ,\nProject Manager:yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:what does that mean ?\nProject Manager:As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay , 'kay .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So we need to {disfmarker} yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?\nIndustrial Designer:Alright . {vocalsound} I can go first ,\nProject Manager:You wanna go first ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . Hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I assume we just pull it out ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Um {vocalsound} so f from the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we {disfmarker} you don't have to do it now but when {disfmarker} once you go back ,\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Right sure .\nProject Manager:just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So n uh with uh with regard to the {vocalsound} uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um {vocalsound} a few basic uh components of the remote and uh {vocalsound} se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um {vocalsound} in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then {disfmarker} so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated {vocalsound} to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Um so {vocalsound} i in my personal preferences um {vocalsound} I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um {vocalsound} uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . {vocalsound} That's about it . {vocalsound} So anything that you would like to know or {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager:Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Br\nIndustrial Designer:Um yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah , {vocalsound} we definitely need to operate within our constraints ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but um {vocalsound} unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that .\nProject Manager:That's fine . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think that will do . Okay , so do you want to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes , shall shall we pull this up ?\nUser Interface:okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:I think that has to come out of there .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh i {vocalsound} Okay , I hope {disfmarker} wait . Should it just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I it'll take some time .\nProject Manager:It ta takes a little {disfmarker} Oh , and have you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:There's just nothing .\nProject Manager:you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight ,\nUser Interface:Oh right , right , right , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight .\nUser Interface:Okay . Nothin\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , there it is , yeah .\nUser Interface:okay , something is coming up .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Now it's coming ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It'll come up , it {disfmarker} um uh no signal .\nProject Manager:computer no signal .\nUser Interface:No signal ? Why ?\nProject Manager:Maybe again ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah , it says something now ,\nUser Interface:Oh . My my computer went blank now .\nIndustrial Designer:adjusting {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , adjusting .\nUser Interface:Adjusting . But {vocalsound} I don't see anything\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:There we go , there we go .\nUser Interface:I don't see anything on my computer now .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , that's strange .\nProject Manager:Oh , if you press if you press function and that again\nUser Interface:This is the problem , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:And one more time .\nProject Manager:Okay , so one more time .\nUser Interface:Uh now it's {disfmarker} okay . No ? No .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Should {disfmarker} yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting .\nUser Interface:Oh okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay , that's fine , that's good . Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some {vocalsound} some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um {vocalsound} all the project but it's just at th at this very moment .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um uh my method was um to look at um other {vocalsound} um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . {vocalsound} And yeah , and then just to um {vocalsound} put the main function of the remote control in in words .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um so the findings uh were {vocalsound} um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm {vocalsound} uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I als\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ?\nUser Interface:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , {vocalsound} okay , that's great .\nUser Interface:'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm {vocalsound} functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then {vocalsound} there are {disfmarker} surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then {vocalsound} the channel numbers and then um {vocalsound} the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um {vocalsound} could be just {disfmarker} uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um {vocalsound} done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So at the {disfmarker} for the time being that's uh that's all .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:If you have questions {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:If {disfmarker} I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for {disfmarker} that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and also it's it's um {disfmarker} other question is uh because there are so many different {disfmarker} And there are so many different things that could possibly be included\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um {vocalsound} so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or {disfmarker} I mean in {disfmarker} we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ?\nUser Interface:Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and it'll make the costs {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh with um {disfmarker} because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Yep .\nProject Manager:Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one .\nMarketing:Cool . Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?\nProject Manager:Do you want to {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh am I going in the right direction ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wait .\nProject Manager:Oh , I'm getting hungry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , here it comes . Okay , here you are .\nMarketing:Cool . Ah , that's why it won't meet . {vocalsound} Okay , cool .\nProject Manager:You set ?\nMarketing:Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements .\nProject Manager:Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .\nMarketing:Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager:Hello .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} try to press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is it plugged in prop\nIndustrial Designer:oh , okay ,\nMarketing:It's working .\nProject Manager:it's working ?\nIndustrial Designer:yep .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Cool , okay .\nProject Manager:Excellent .\nMarketing:So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um okay , so . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . {vocalsound} Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .\nMarketing:Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:they just make it look ugly .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing .\nProject Manager:Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see .\nMarketing:Mm k\nProject Manager:If you explain it to us it'll be fine .\nMarketing:Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . What it is is um it's cones ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . Um but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I liked the , I liked the litt\nMarketing:ooh where's it go ?\nProject Manager:ooh come back .\nMarketing:Back . Oh .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:Oh yes , cool . Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . {vocalsound} Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then {vocalsound} that's the least of your problems ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} The remote control . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:but you know , {vocalsound} it's up there .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Um that {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again .\nProject Manager:That's alright .\nMarketing:Um okay , but that shows how people {disfmarker} whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite {disfmarker} are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Um okay ? Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . {vocalsound} So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Mm .\nMarketing:Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:not a mobile phone {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Some kind of a ring ,\nProject Manager:Keys and things like that ,\nIndustrial Designer:some {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , that's it , you know .\nProject Manager:yeah . Whistle and it {vocalsound} screams at you , yeah .\nMarketing:I know , it's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something {vocalsound} {disfmarker} a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:So okay ? Cool . That's me . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , that's great ,\nProject Manager:That's you , excellent .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um that's very good ,\nIndustrial Designer:thanks .\nProject Manager:Um .\nUser Interface:very interesting .\nProject Manager:I'm just gonna tick yes . So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound} I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um {vocalsound} uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um {vocalsound} uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people .\nMarketing:Cat's . Ca {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:So if we need to have a target group um then uh {vocalsound} I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:but I'm assuming , you know , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket\nIndustrial Designer:Right , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and the {disfmarker} I don't know how often they're buying televisions .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right . Mm .\nMarketing:Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah ,\nProject Manager:I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:you share a television or something that {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ?\nProject Manager:O oh it's on {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh , I've unplugged it .\nProject Manager:sorry , we unplugged it .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , oh , okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Do you want me to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Here , let me {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Seventy six point three percent .\nIndustrial Designer:so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them .\nUser Interface:It was seventy something , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like {disfmarker} I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , they've got no commitments and\nMarketing:but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy ,\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:you don't normally have a car ,\nProject Manager:usually not a car and all of those things .\nMarketing:yeah , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:You're still learning to drive actually ,\nProject Manager:Kids . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So you're more likely to b\nMarketing:so that just costs more than a car ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} but yeah . Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people .\nMarketing:No , I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah this this is not {vocalsound} unaffordable ,\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ {vocalsound} to use its full {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . We didn't have a T_V_ last year ,\nProject Manager:But do they {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know .\nProject Manager:But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah\nUser Interface:Common , the students {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . The s the stu\nProject Manager:and be a bit strange to have a fancy {vocalsound} rome remote .\nUser Interface:yeah , and the remote control might not {disfmarker} yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm\nUser Interface:it might not even function with the old T_V_ .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:So mm uh are are are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:we're still {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and {disfmarker} I don't think it's something to ignore , you know .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:because actually I mean they're all still re young people .\nMarketing:Is not a massive difference , you know . No , do totally .\nProject Manager:Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Is that gonna have a {disfmarker} an implication for the technical specs ?\nIndustrial Designer:I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? Uh and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like {disfmarker} I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and um uh h ho how good is it ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't know .\nProject Manager:Yeah . With um {disfmarker} but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five ,\nUser Interface:An\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:S so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:louder ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Okay .\nProject Manager:tha that should be relatively simple .\nIndustrial Designer:O {vocalsound}\nMarketing:y you'd maybe need a code word . Do you know what I mean ?\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:So like when you say change , except that's {vocalsound} being said quite a lot on T_V_ ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:so maybe like , you know , remote . I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Although I only watch Charmed , so really {vocalsound} I wouldn't know\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check .\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money ,\nUser Interface:Yeah but uh um {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls .\nUser Interface:Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . W\nProject Manager:I think we need both .\nIndustrial Designer:What uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:What wh uh {vocalsound} what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with {disfmarker} away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , that would be another way to do it .\nProject Manager:So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great .\nIndustrial Designer:some kind of {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because {disfmarker} I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:so then it would be {disfmarker} you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Watch Sky and {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:and that would be really annoying . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . But that's definitely a possibility .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't {vocalsound} as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .\nMarketing:Yeah . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So that you can yell at it ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it {vocalsound} and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but then the remote control I think {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} um the idea is kind of {disfmarker} it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:being cl I mean it'll it'll {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface:No , but I I I was just defending the {vocalsound} the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . So uh {vocalsound} wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so we we can probably come to know where it is .\nProject Manager:That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but then if you're buying the remote separately ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:but y {vocalsound} you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something ,\nUser Interface:Oh yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:some {disfmarker} like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .\nProject Manager:The l\nIndustrial Designer:Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager:Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .\nMarketing:Yeah , definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um {vocalsound} specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option\nUser Interface:The major ones , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .\nIndustrial Designer:So where exactly is this i\nProject Manager:It should be on your desktop , so on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Ah , okay .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So I'll put it {disfmarker} I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Did you find it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah in that one ,\nUser Interface:It's just {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:right yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and email them round .\nMarketing:Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , that would be great .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Oh so so we'll just put them i there ,\nProject Manager:Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah ,\nUser Interface:we we {disfmarker} yeah , w we won't even {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing:There you go .\nProject Manager:then you don't have to email them .\nMarketing:But is everyone's called functional requirements ?\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , so that's good .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:That's me done .\nProject Manager:So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .\nMarketing:Okay , cool .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Yeah ? Whatever that means .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I guess I'll find out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You'll be looking {vocalsound} you'll be looking at the user interface concept ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh something conceptual , yeah .\nProject Manager:on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer:Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .\nProject Manager:Components ,\nUser Interface:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or {vocalsound} shall we prepare our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No , we have we have {disfmarker} after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare ,\nUser Interface:To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager:so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay ? Right on time .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , {vocalsound} so you can {disfmarker} I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , see you .\n", "summary": "This meeting was about functional design. Firstly, the group had three presentations on working design, technical functions and functional requirements. They suggested basic components of the remote control including the size, the colour, the ease of using and main buttons. Then group mates had a discussion on general requirements. They agreed to target disposable income groups between 15 to 35 years of age group. Also, they decided to have a simple, small-sized remote with key buttons and a menu button. Lastly, they agreed to integrate the voice recognition technology because the group mates thought they should not only focus on the target age group from 15 to 25, but also the age group from 25 to 35.", "length": 12912}
{"id": 5, "conversations": "Project Manager:So\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\nMarketing:Of course . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} yeah . So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Who starts ? {vocalsound} Oh . Ha . okay .\nProject Manager:So wait a minute . Mm .\nMarketing:So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . Do you want {disfmarker} yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So , um\nUser Interface:Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh .\nMarketing:yeah , this is my name . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We met before .\nMarketing:So as you know , you {disfmarker} I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm {vocalsound} uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it is put F_ five {gap} .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:The full page presentation , yep .\nMarketing:Yeah maybe in the full page\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:F_ F_ five .\nMarketing:because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yep .\nProject Manager:F_ five .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh-huh hmm okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nMarketing:So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Agree .\nMarketing:Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} .\nProject Manager:Why not ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:But why not ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\nMarketing:Oh , okay ,\nUser Interface:No , I don't think so .\nMarketing:I think it's a technical thing\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nMarketing:which our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and those waves have high {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nUser Interface:Twenty five . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nMarketing:but we have to take this into account .\nUser Interface:Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:So anyway\nUser Interface:One of us {disfmarker}\nMarketing:that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So we've listed a couple of uh\nUser Interface:Functions .\nMarketing:s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nMarketing:I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nProject Manager:I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nMarketing:I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now\nProject Manager:Mm-mm . Okay .\nMarketing:this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?\nProject Manager:Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .\nUser Interface:I got one question ,\nMarketing:I can go back .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nMarketing:Yeah one question ,\nUser Interface:uh you are a Market Expert\nMarketing:yeah ?\nUser Interface:so\nMarketing:I am . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:should we aim at the young people or not ?\nMarketing:I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay , then teletext is used less .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:That's good point .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , yep .\nUser Interface:Mm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:'Kay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Of the technical function , so {vocalsound} uh\nMarketing:So I think it's you , huh ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's\nMarketing:No ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's me .\nProject Manager:what effect {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:techni function of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No , user requiremen\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Wait a second .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Argh .\nIndustrial Designer:I have to do working design so uh\nProject Manager:So you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That's {disfmarker} but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I'm a more an artist\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nProject Manager:Okay . Let's go .\nUser Interface:So next slide please . And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nMarketing:Makes sense . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:which one would you prefer ? I guess this .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\nUser Interface:Sure , sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like , between those two\nUser Interface:Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple\nIndustrial Designer:li\nProject Manager:Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:simple desires into simple actions .\nMarketing:Nice . Nice sentence .\nUser Interface:Findings .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh sorry .\nUser Interface:Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Concept .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's a really good style , it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So {disfmarker} Press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager:It's off .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:It's on .\nUser Interface:the T_V_ turns on .\nMarketing:And when does it turn off ?\nUser Interface:When you don't touch the control but you go out of the {disfmarker} For for enough time\nMarketing:Oh so you have a\nUser Interface:like uh you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:sensing {disfmarker} sensor machine that uh knows {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's a question to our technical design , our {vocalsound} two engineers .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Tech {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\nProject Manager:Or you want to go to the kitchen . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's easy to do ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:you just control the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:According to your distance to {disfmarker} and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\nIndustrial Designer:Distance .\nUser Interface:According to the distance . {gap} Yeah yeah yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\nUser Interface:I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . {gap}\nUser Interface:So , its main purpose in fact is a back light ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:which change colours ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:which makes it easier to find , and each can {disfmarker} it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:So basically that's it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\nUser Interface:Can be easily done ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Just few actions , a few actions for everything .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Hmm . S\nUser Interface:All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nProject Manager:Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah and it {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface:Okay , but it's quite universal you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:We can just extend it to any device .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:So for instance if I want to go to {disfmarker} directly to channel twenty five , how would I do {disfmarker} can I do that with this ?\nUser Interface:Uh twenty five .\nMarketing:Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} In fact I would propose another solution .\nMarketing:Or is it ?\nUser Interface:Basically you use just four or five channels , right ?\nMarketing:Most people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah .\nUser Interface:So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\nMarketing:In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button .\nProject Manager:Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .\nMarketing:I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:B yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number\nMarketing:Go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer:and then it go\nMarketing:One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\nIndustrial Designer:t because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:But still {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .\nProject Manager:Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And it's only next .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah\nUser Interface:Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\nMarketing:so {disfmarker} but you have to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah. .\nUser Interface:Or say this can be back .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press {disfmarker} suppose two five they just press two and five\nMarketing:So it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and then {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and you can change mode {disfmarker} zapping mode or\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Alright .\nProject Manager:uh current chan\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Listening more .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so we can have more functions for T_V_\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nMarketing:Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Although I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Alright ? Thanks for your attention .\nProject Manager:Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry .\nProject Manager:You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .\nProject Manager:Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nProject Manager:On {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , so that we just use simple recog\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Too complex .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:no but but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\nMarketing:Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And what about the price of this component ?\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\nProject Manager:It mm {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing:Hmm . Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer:because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,\nMarketing:Millions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so we can make really simp\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and we want to make really simple device\nMarketing:Cheap .\nIndustrial Designer:because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .\nMarketing:The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nIndustrial Designer:Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nMarketing:Couple of words .\nIndustrial Designer:then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nMarketing:Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface:No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nProject Manager:No , in no not only speech , yeah .\nMarketing:It's on top of using the button .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I it's an option .\nUser Interface:Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .\nMarketing:Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key .\nUser Interface:Okay. .\nIndustrial Designer:So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nMarketing:T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Sho to to train , okay .\nUser Interface:Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:roll 'em up\nIndustrial Designer:Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nUser Interface:or roll 'em down .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Very expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer:because it's it's very expensive\nMarketing:no ?\nIndustrial Designer:because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nProject Manager:And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm why ?\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nMarketing:And volume control .\nIndustrial Designer:even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nMarketing:So but uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Wouldn't that make uh {vocalsound} arguments ?\nIndustrial Designer:They can make {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , of course .\nProject Manager:I want uh {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah we can have {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} That's no problem , we will sell more . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And we can increase this {vocalsound} the strength\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We got a really good Market Expert .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah exactly .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Let's send more , let's sell more .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , not very much ,\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:like {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Thanks .\nProject Manager:Okay , thanks .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you . Yep . Thank you .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So\nIndustrial Designer:Can you just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:mm\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .\nMarketing:Mm great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um {vocalsound} we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um {disfmarker} on the components so {vocalsound} uh you will focus on the component concept um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nIndustrial Designer:Mark will {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So {vocalsound} um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . And we have um maybe we have to {disfmarker} we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's in current price , yeah .\nMarketing:Difficult .\nProject Manager:Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible .\nProject Manager:Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And um do you see something else ?\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Speakers in the remote cont\nUser Interface:Like , you want to find it , you shout\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh yeah\nUser Interface:control ,\nProject Manager:that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:and it answers is I'm here ? Or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It just beeps .\nUser Interface:Just beeps ?\nMarketing:That would be enough .\nProject Manager:Or maybe you want to phone him .\nMarketing:Something very cheap .\nProject Manager:Since now all {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah yeah .\nMarketing:But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\nProject Manager:yeah ? Think\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:because it should be all the time on and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And it's answered .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .\nMarketing:You can't whistle . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ?\nProject Manager:Clap clap clap it's a good {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Clap is good .\nProject Manager:I I think it's universal .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Tak\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} What about people without hand ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Just a {vocalsound} suggestion .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah I think it's good .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} With only one hand ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} These are not our target people . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm uh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface:Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nMarketing:Oh that's e that already exists\nUser Interface:Yeah , I got it at my home , like {gap} {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:okay okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Oh yeah , you do have .\nUser Interface:Oops .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Wow . You're trendy . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , so {vocalsound} let's to think s so that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Think about it .\nProject Manager:yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .\nMarketing:Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . Good\nProject Manager:So ,\nMarketing:we're done ?\nProject Manager:yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:let's go to lunch .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you , thank you very much .\nMarketing:Right , thanks .\nProject Manager:{gap}\n", "summary": "The meeting was basically on functional design. First, the marketing talked about the user requirements based on a market survey and suggested making their new product good-looking and equipped with less buttons and a speech recognition system. Then the user interface designer stressed that they should design nothing but a remote control because their principle was to make users' simple desires into simple actions. Therefore, the proposed concept for design included just a few buttons, a screen with a back light and titanium, which was accepted by the group. Finally, when it came to the working design of the remote control, the industrial designer described the product as a portable device with some energy source, an interface, a processor, some infrared source, different encryption codes for different TVs, and speech recogniser. All these components would be within budget. At the end of the meeting, the group also talked about how to enable the users to find the controller.", "length": 11943}
{"id": 7, "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:is the penultim meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:How was lunch ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Don't be sarcastic . {vocalsound} Mark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .\nMarketing:Uh Rama .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ramaro .\nProject Manager:Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing:What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:Why ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing:The cost .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager:Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm like this ?\nProject Manager:Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:rubber is expensive\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And this push buttons\nProject Manager:Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager:Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer:for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing:Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ?\nMarketing:L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh l\nMarketing:Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh\nUser Interface:No ,\nIndustrial Designer:it's like a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .\nMarketing:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay , so let's try it , let's t\nIndustrial Designer:because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or {gap} or something so we want to reduce the cost on display\nMarketing:{gap} The L_C_D_ would {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:or this inter\nMarketing:The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .\nMarketing:Just uh for output , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:because like it won't take much money I guess ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yep .\nProject Manager:{gap} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:You have any further questions or ?\nMarketing:I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:for really light batteries and with uh good price .\nMarketing:So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be {disfmarker} ask .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's {disfmarker} then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it {disfmarker} m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:and so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:for the location . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , if if everybody in the house n {gap} to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . So let's now go to the {disfmarker} you don't have more question ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:No , it's okay .\nProject Manager:Um mm thank you mm .\nUser Interface:No more questions .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep . Thank you .\nMarketing:Puts less of constraint on what we can do\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:but\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:it's always like that . We have dreams and the {disfmarker} in the end we find out that it's not feasible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . We have uh some limitations {gap} . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Anyway . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice ,\nMarketing:L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:L_C_ {vocalsound}\nMarketing:L_S_D_ is something else ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:and it's quite nice as well . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I'm an artist , sorry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:So ,\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} yeah .\nUser Interface:So uh , that's not {disfmarker}\nMarketing:go on uh artist . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I hope that's not too much .\nProject Manager:Now let's talk about uh interface .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound} Uh participant number three .\nProject Manager:Three .\nIndustrial Designer:Three .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh\nProject Manager:Which one ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:mm mm uh have a look at this {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:no it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{gap} Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and uh we got explanation for every button\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no {gap} ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Let's change millenniums . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:maybe you can use {gap} in the end and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} doesn't make sense . This is very {vocalsound} ugly .\nUser Interface:Really ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I thought you like it . Ah okay\nMarketing:Oh no ,\nUser Interface:just press the button , please uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:too much concept .\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:Ah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But instead of this I will devise {disfmarker} That's our concept .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ah , back today . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . 'Kay .\nUser Interface:And uh what will people say ? They'll say it's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{gap} Do you think it can come in several colours ?\nUser Interface:And everyone's gonna be satisfied .\nMarketing:Or did the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .\nMarketing:Um but not the case .\nUser Interface:Not the case .\nMarketing:Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .\nMarketing:Mm yeah , okay ,\nUser Interface:Do you like it ?\nMarketing:so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} But it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:but I don't use that but again , uh I might {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That's why you don't have it . That's why ,\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:'cause it's nasty . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:bu but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we can just {disfmarker} if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .\nUser Interface:Um , I am here .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So users have different {disfmarker} I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So we can just {disfmarker} if they want they can just pay another two Euro .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh , okay , so\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we {disfmarker} if you want o more colours {vocalsound} on L_C_D_ ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh {disfmarker} so that we can {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Kind of upgradable uh {vocalsound} remote control .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Wow , wow .\nIndustrial Designer:Just they'll get few more things and few more colours .\nUser Interface:Okay , what uh {disfmarker} there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um {vocalsound} 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,\nIndustrial Designer:Lights , yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Like a chameleon .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:We can make it in fact .\nProject Manager:Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .\nUser Interface:If if if the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:okay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:But uh it can be in uh maybe in an {disfmarker} a gradable version ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but {disfmarker} and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And that makes me special .\nProject Manager:Okay\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of {vocalsound} uh o or this is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .\nProject Manager:Okay , so\nMarketing:Those who wanted to have it pink .\nProject Manager:so {vocalsound} i it's not uh a s base service\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No mm no .\nProject Manager:it's a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:{gap} be an option ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:It might be optional , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can {gap} those {disfmarker}\nMarketing:The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah .\nMarketing:Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So m so\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:maybe that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And you'll be different .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And it makes you different ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:you know ?\nMarketing:You always have your remote .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . {vocalsound} Want to change my neighbour .\nUser Interface:Anyone has their remote controls here ?\nMarketing:Oh , you don't ? {vocalsound} Yeah . You don't have your remo {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . {vocalsound} Uh it's white\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:It has this distinctive look and feel and look {gap} which people seems to like {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:just because it's {vocalsound} a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?\nMarketing:Seems important .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light ,\nMarketing:Mm {gap} glow in the dark ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nMarketing:so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so that like {disfmarker} at least um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Iradium ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ah sorry . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . So mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . S well ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:let's go on maybe with the presentation .\nMarketing:Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And um the remote control's going to be smart\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nUser Interface:but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I dunno\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:that's a question to you and to mm to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .\nUser Interface:Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I dunno . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm , that's a nice world . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So just just just just think about it um .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} Thank you .\nMarketing:Don't touch the remote .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want .\nUser Interface:Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .\nMarketing:Like with some {disfmarker} Maybe fingerprint recognition or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Voice recognition is quite tough . I say don't use it , and the control just looks .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh that {disfmarker} mm that could be feasible I guess , like {disfmarker} So since we have {disfmarker} we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . So it could be smart in that way .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm . Okay .\nMarketing:But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh {disfmarker} things like that\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I dunno , that might be expensive\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:but\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:that might also be a good sales pitch again .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} The remote that knows you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay , thanks .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:My turn ?\nProject Manager:yeah , Marketing Expert .\nMarketing:{gap} Okay , it's alright .\nProject Manager:Participant two ?\nIndustrial Designer:Four .\nProject Manager:Four ,\nMarketing:Four , I think .\nProject Manager:sorry .\nMarketing:Trend , yeah . No uh yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on {vocalsound} how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people {gap} have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh {vocalsound} example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also {disfmarker} have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So anyway uh next slide please . {vocalsound} Uh to be to be quick {vocalsound} there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are {disfmarker} uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very {disfmarker} pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh {vocalsound} it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Next slide please .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so {disfmarker} currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of {vocalsound} of look or feel\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:or so . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And I think of course uh {vocalsound} i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . {vocalsound} It it can travel f from clothe to furniture {vocalsound} same idea .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . {vocalsound} And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:What is spongy ?\nMarketing:yeah . Well\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nMarketing:this {vocalsound} so so I think uh uh i\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} kind of um maybe {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing:When we were talking about rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {gap} We need to think about {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing:Seems not , seems not .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} sorry Mark .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It seems to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer:Fruit . Even shape ?\nMarketing:as a {disfmarker} even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} More {gap}\nProject Manager:Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound} You're old-fashioned .\nMarketing:So that's what people seem to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought\nProject Manager:Sorry . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but that's that's fashion and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay that's all I have to say .\nProject Manager:Mm you have questions ?\nIndustrial Designer:So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:These {disfmarker} I'm sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:This {disfmarker} you you {gap} so did you {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course ,\nIndustrial Designer:Where ? Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm .\nMarketing:as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends\nIndustrial Designer:It's not from {disfmarker} mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:that are also {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's more general trend\nMarketing:well .\nIndustrial Designer:it's not particular to the remote control .\nMarketing:No , it's not it's not {disfmarker} this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing:The {disfmarker} what we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy\nMarketing:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah yeah .\nMarketing:We have to {disfmarker} I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:but we still have to put our chips inside , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of course .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah\nMarketing:This is your problem .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:that {disfmarker} yeah yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} This is not mine . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , looking {disfmarker} yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape\nMarketing:Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material .\nIndustrial Designer:or at least {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If if it's something like rubber made or {disfmarker} I think it it's also going to be good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay ?\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No more question ? Okay .\nMarketing:Yep . Thanks .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design ,\nIndustrial Designer:Look and feel de\nProject Manager:um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . {vocalsound} Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Hmm . Mm sounds interesting . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm um and I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Thanks . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So , can we highlight the specific features of our {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah you're right , you have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables ,\nProject Manager:So\nIndustrial Designer:that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:you say s\nIndustrial Designer:we want to follow general trend .\nMarketing:Spongy .\nProject Manager:S\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:do we agree on that ? Yeah . We have to .\nIndustrial Designer:So , do you think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No , we don't have to ,\nUser Interface:So we have to uh for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:but seems it's the trend .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Yeah .\nMarketing:Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .\nUser Interface:yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So there's no {disfmarker} Well , that's {disfmarker} you t can try to convince us .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well , we can make it smell like fruit . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} {gap} that's a good idea ,\nProject Manager:Okay , {vocalsound} that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So titanium smell like fruit .\nMarketing:I {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like {disfmarker} They more want these fancy features\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker} I think i\nIndustrial Designer:like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Feature {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:because we have it\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and others don't .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I I agree with uh this uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Maybe you could explore the two option .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean {gap} fruit-shaped .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah it's it's\nMarketing:Mm . Seems to be {gap} .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive\nUser Interface:Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\nIndustrial Designer:and d Hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-mm . Okay , so\nUser Interface:Well , okay w we'll see .\nProject Manager:you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nUser Interface:Yeah\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Or or spongy an yeah . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We'll see . We'll see .\nMarketing:If you have time .\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:but uh it cannot be both .\nUser Interface:We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} For creation .\nUser Interface:I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:we'll look .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Even design . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:You can paint it afterward {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , okay .\nMarketing:No problem . We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint .\nProject Manager:Yeah , do don't worry , you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You will do it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Alright , alright .\nProject Manager:Okay . So explore a shape .\nIndustrial Designer:So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Not uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says {disfmarker} if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , then we can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} user friendly\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:That's the converse to having zillions of button\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:where each button does only one thing .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah yeah j yeah ,\nMarketing:Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .\nIndustrial Designer:because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Anyway it's very {disfmarker} in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So . {vocalsound} Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So it's {gap} very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . So\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:are we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , we're done .\nMarketing:We're done .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . So see you in thirty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\n", "summary": "The meeting was mainly about conceptual design. In the beginning, the group focused on industrial components: energy, material and interface. The industrial designer preferred traditional batteries, titanium and simple push buttons so that they would have enough money for speech recognition. After that, the group talked about LCD display and locating methods. The second topic was user interface concept, which was basically a good-looking design with few buttons. The group decided to change the colour of the assembly at an extra charge to meet special needs. To make a smart controller, they mentioned speech recognition and user identification. When it came to trend watching, the marketing put forward three noteworthy aspects - being fancy, technologically innovative and useful. The group agreed to follow the trend but the specific design was not decided.", "length": 12399}
{"id": 8, "conversations": "Industrial Designer:{vocalsound} I'm proud of it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:It does look very cool .\nProject Manager:Um then\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S\nMarketing:And then do we get to make a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:So\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nProject Manager:Is that right ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay , so .\nProject Manager:Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Presentation .\nUser Interface:so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's a bit um phallic .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Dual use , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Dual use , perfect .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nProject Manager:Sorry , sorry .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Wow .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .\nUser Interface:Rubber .\nMarketing:Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface:so we said the back side round , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:It l does look like the {gap} curvy\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Huh . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and {disfmarker} like the previous one and the next one .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .\nMarketing:So where's the volume ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The volume is is scrolling .\nIndustrial Designer:It's on the side .\nUser Interface:On the side ,\nMarketing:Ah , you did get that in then ,\nUser Interface:this one . Yeah you just do it like this .\nMarketing:mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .\nMarketing:Oh okay , {gap} .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:See ? So the volume is {vocalsound} you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , {vocalsound} okay , there there you have the screen\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and and you have the mm {vocalsound} spinning wheel with options to choose .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh no , we we'd not put {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:A mute button .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .\nUser Interface:Well , {gap} we'll have this on the screen , on the display .\nProject Manager:Y or you could have it {disfmarker} so you {disfmarker} on the wheel if you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .\nUser Interface:Well , but the but the mute {disfmarker} yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?\nProject Manager:But if you hold it in ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?\nProject Manager:if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?\nMarketing:Okay , cool .\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah , okay .\nMarketing:So that {gap} that solves the whole mute issue .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound} And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .\nProject Manager:{gap} no .\nUser Interface:You can't really see it in the interface .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , very good .\nUser Interface:So I think it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We ran out of resources here , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:In the actual one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You can have a look . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So if you have questions .\nProject Manager:Very good , let's have a look .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Test it out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .\nMarketing:Yeah , oh , we hold the remote .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I hate Play-Do , it's just minging .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .\nProject Manager:Very good .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:and then we'll there {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , see the budget .\nProject Manager:I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and cut some of the prices that way .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Wales . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Wales , for example . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fabulous ,\nProject Manager:Marketing Expert .\nMarketing:yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer {disfmarker} prepare the evaluation of the new design . {vocalsound} Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like {disfmarker} so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Cool , so these are what they are . Oh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?\nMarketing:Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .\nProject Manager:Mm dots , never mind .\nMarketing:Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface:Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .\nMarketing:Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , just prepare one now .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:It will be red , too .\nMarketing:Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ?\nIndustrial Designer:So ?\nProject Manager:I reckon it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} S seven was th the maximum , yeah ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I I go for seven .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing:Oh {vocalsound} we're all so proud of the {gap} .\nProject Manager:Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Could {disfmarker} oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .\nProject Manager:Ah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Excellent . Except we can't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But we can we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But that's alright .\nProject Manager:uh we can if we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I can I can take note uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute .\nProject Manager:then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine .\nMarketing:Okay , so {vocalsound} we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,\nProject Manager:I think it does .\nUser Interface:I would think yes , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Alright .\nUser Interface:so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m {vocalsound} model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But that's gonna be a problem ,\nIndustrial Designer:But then {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So bu it's it's not a huge problem ,\nMarketing:I th I think it's not {vocalsound} it's not like it's a pen .\nIndustrial Designer:because i i it is operatable .\nUser Interface:But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so they just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:but they can normally do most things right-handed ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:so I would say it's not such a big issue .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:So maybe we need to put {disfmarker} that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What do you what do you all think ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Six .\nUser Interface:Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think I think for um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean . Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean most people are right-handed , so in {vocalsound} in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want {disfmarker} might want to um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:One more thing is that i\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,\nProject Manager:They {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so it opens on the side . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:No , yeah , but mm but we have it {vocalsound} nicely {vocalsound} with the hinges here {gap} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah , I mean {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So it won't be a problem ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So you guys can decide wh whether {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it will be {disfmarker} and it will be {disfmarker} it won't be heavy .\nIndustrial Designer:Oops .\nMarketing:I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but we {disfmarker} which makes it kind of really big , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah well yeah ,\nProject Manager:The length is gonna be difficu\nUser Interface:but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long .\nMarketing:Yeah um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah .\nMarketing:But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh this this kind of uh makes it more {gap}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:S uh slightly smaller .\nIndustrial Designer:and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel .\nMarketing:So you have to keep that side flat .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . Um {vocalsound} okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:No , we have a locator .\nProject Manager:No , we're gonna put it like {disfmarker} we've got th there's the locator dot .\nMarketing:There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a {disfmarker} that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,\nUser Interface:Mm that you stick on T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:doesn't it ? To make it beep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Or a buzzer .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some {disfmarker} to make some sounds , so {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Fabulous . D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Intuitive , completely intuitive . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . If {vocalsound} uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and it's {disfmarker} I th I think it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I'd say six , 'cause the {disfmarker} I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .\nIndustrial Designer:Intuitive .\nMarketing:Yeah , and I mean d\nIndustrial Designer:And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni\nProject Manager:Might be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .\nProject Manager:But it {disfmarker} and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:So , should we maybe say f a five\nIndustrial Designer:So l\nMarketing:and say it is intuitive ,\nProject Manager:Five ?\nMarketing:but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:I'm happy with five ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive but {disfmarker} Sorry , it's really hard to write on those .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I just went a bit mad , didn't I ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate .\nProject Manager:Yep . But otherwise it's superb .\nMarketing:So , should we give it a six ?\nProject Manager:Six .\nMarketing:Six ?\nUser Interface:Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nUser Interface:but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting .\nUser Interface:yeah ? See .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so it's kinda {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic .\nMarketing:I used to send fifty texts a day , you know ,\nProject Manager:Well we've banned them from {disfmarker}\nMarketing:and I never got repetitive strain injury from that ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah .\nMarketing:so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest .\nIndustrial Designer:And moreover it it has um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and everything ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's varied .\nMarketing:Okay , so we give that a six ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Six ?\nMarketing:yeah . Okay , F_ .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} it does have {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Absolutely .\nProject Manager:Voice control have seven .\nMarketing:Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .\nMarketing:Oh okay , cool . Um {vocalsound} right , so {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:So it has voice control .\nMarketing:Yes , so that's a seven then .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:Um , cool .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:G_ technologically innovative .\nIndustrial Designer:Anyway it ha yeah ,\nUser Interface:Technologi {gap} well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is {disfmarker} yeah , it's kind of new .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , but I mean you don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:All of the components have been used in other things before .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote .\nUser Interface:But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .\nMarketing:They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .\nProject Manager:But do {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:What do you reckon , five , six ?\nMarketing:Yeah , what do you all think ?\nUser Interface:Six .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Six ?\nUser Interface:I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , that's it , I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It still has to do what i what it has to do .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So , I don't think many peop\nProject Manager:Space remote .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's it , they can take it with them .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Put fashion in electronics .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , isn't it fashionable ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The carrot banana remote . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's the maximum fashion .\nMarketing:So , we give it seven , and we write {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:There we go .\nIndustrial Designer:I think that's a {gap} .\nUser Interface:So I think we've done very well , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Cool .\nProject Manager:Very good .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} What's the assessment ?\nMarketing:So , we need the average here , so we got {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:The average is about six and something .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , one .\nUser Interface:A little bit over six .\nMarketing:Seven {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} There are how many sixes ?\nProject Manager:Or a seven {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:One , two , three .\nMarketing:So we've got four sevens ,\nUser Interface:No , wait , a little bit under six .\nMarketing:so that's twenty eight ,\nIndustrial Designer:Three .\nUser Interface:No , wait .\nMarketing:three sixes ,\nIndustrial Designer:And one five .\nMarketing:eighteen .\nUser Interface:Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one .\nProject Manager:Six point point {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Fifty one divided by {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Six point something , yeah .\nMarketing:Two three four {disfmarker} Seven eight .\nProject Manager:about six point five .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Six point five , yeah .\nProject Manager:Close enough .\nMarketing:Okay , that's pretty good , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Now wait until we {vocalsound} get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?\nMarketing:Um no , that's it ,\nProject Manager:That's it ?\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:Alright . So , finance . And we'll see if we can unscrew this first .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Cool , there we go .\nProject Manager:Sorry , this is {disfmarker} I'm just um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap} . There we go and there are the marks .\nProject Manager:Beautiful .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Not anymore .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Computer no signal ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit .\nProject Manager:Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:One simple battery .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer:Advanced , yeah .\nProject Manager:We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yes .\nProject Manager:Case material we said rubber .\nUser Interface:Rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:I don't know what special colour means .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm anything uh I think which is not more {gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It could be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .\nProject Manager:Rub rubber comes coloured ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it's {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .\nUser Interface:Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} yeah yeah , okay .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:you might end up having to take off the sample sensor .\nProject Manager:We we're definitely going to have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We have pushbuttons ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:so we've got pushbutton , and then we've\nUser Interface:scro we have scroll wheel as well .\nProject Manager:Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?\nIndustrial Designer:No uh we we have uh yeah .\nUser Interface:S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And we have L_C_ display\nProject Manager:And button supplements .\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm no .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap} . No .\nIndustrial Designer:We don't have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No . No ?\nIndustrial Designer:we're not using any of that .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have {disfmarker} think {disfmarker} maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:We've got more than one pushbutton though ,\nUser Interface:Okay , let's {gap} yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:haven't we ?\nProject Manager:I think the pushbutton {disfmarker} oh .\nMarketing:'Cause then you have {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I don't know if that's one {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That seems unlikely .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh ?\nProject Manager:Push what uh\nIndustrial Designer:Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh .\nMarketing:Twelve point five .\nProject Manager:whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We have to count all of them , or {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm I don't think so , no .\nProject Manager:I don't think that makes sense .\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:No it says what what is the kind of interface ,\nMarketing:Well it doesn't , but it uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel {disfmarker} so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:And L_C_ display .\nIndustrial Designer:so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Wh wh what's our criteria ?\nMarketing:This sample sensor {gap} .\nProject Manager:Our budget's twelve point five .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so that has implications though for the {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . {gap} when you say {disfmarker} when you press one it says one or it says hello .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:For the locator .\nMarketing:But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm {vocalsound} and the locator also goes away .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:We can afford to get rid of it .\nUser Interface:But it was very no innovative\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So that means no locator , does it ?\nUser Interface:{gap} innovativeness {gap} . Well um {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:I mean does {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What else does it need ?\nUser Interface:Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .\nProject Manager:Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing .\nUser Interface:This would be {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah yeah {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:there you record your samples your speech samples and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay , so we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right , so we need one fifty off .\nMarketing:See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Take it down to just a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} We could do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So tha that {vocalsound} mean that we cannot press {disfmarker} how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget .\nIndustrial Designer:If {vocalsound} in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .\nUser Interface:Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .\nMarketing:But that's {disfmarker} well you would just have to to spin it down {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:No w w w but ha\nMarketing:So that's point three .\nIndustrial Designer:it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .\nUser Interface:But I mean {vocalsound} we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:If you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's with the L_C_\nIndustrial Designer:That comes with the L_C_D_ ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We decided , 'cause it's not on our list .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh so so the the this is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:The scroll wheel is on the side .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} . So {vocalsound} we're adding costs for {gap} right , okay uh I mean I think this is good .\nMarketing:S so we're point three over .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We're point three over at the moment .\nMarketing:Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether\nProject Manager:It's nothing n\nMarketing:and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nMarketing:I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up {disfmarker} for up and down .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:On the side .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:Rather than having three different things that people have to do .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .\nMarketing:Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve {gap} , couldn't we ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .\nMarketing:Yeah , but {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that {gap}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and then I'll take {disfmarker} I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We have , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Not really , no .\nMarketing:No , I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer:Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:We {disfmarker} instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:We just got rid of a gimmick that was never {gap} anyway ,\nIndustrial Designer:Um yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was {disfmarker} it's not a great difference I don't think .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} But we lose the locator .\nProject Manager:Alright then .\nMarketing:Really ?\nProject Manager:We're gonna have a beep .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Well {gap} we're going to have a beeping thing .\nIndustrial Designer:So instead of speaker , {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Cool . That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Tha\nUser Interface:Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh the the beeper thing .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nMarketing:It {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case .\nProject Manager:'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:You know , your pen vibrates ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we've designed a banana .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well done , team . {vocalsound} Um we need {disfmarker} we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think it mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Cool .\nProject Manager:Feedback ? Ideas ?\nUser Interface:Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um we kap kept a adding things randomly .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So , had we known {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:If we'd had that sheet at the beginning {gap} should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , that or not , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So {vocalsound} d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , mm .\nMarketing:I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so you didn't {vocalsound} st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating {vocalsound} remote control {vocalsound} shaped like a banana ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Banana . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um yeah , so yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens .\nUser Interface:And the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh I like the pens .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We like the pens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s\nProject Manager:Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah yeah ,\nProject Manager:and have it printed out when you got back to the office .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that's it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:They great ?\nIndustrial Designer:I wonder what one of these costs . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do you think they'd notice if one went ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I don't think you should say that was the recording .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh okay .\nMarketing:Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yep . Shh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the {disfmarker} I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there ,\nMarketing:It is a bit limiting , isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:yep .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . The thing flew in ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah .\nMarketing:Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} back it , {vocalsound} this is {disfmarker} just had to be changed\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:. And {disfmarker} yeah , so {disfmarker} cool .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And presumably you don't {disfmarker} you can say nasty things as well .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I have no stake in it .\nUser Interface:I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , definitely .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .\nProject Manager:You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I'll leave the room and you can have another go .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Better than that than the banana .\nUser Interface:And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .\nProject Manager:I think it worked quite well .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?\nUser Interface:To express them mm mm\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,\nUser Interface:no .\nIndustrial Designer:so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about .\nUser Interface:Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .\nUser Interface:Yeah , neither neither do I ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Patent patent patent . Mm .\nMarketing:I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\nProject Manager:Banana remote .\nMarketing:but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nProject Manager:. And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget ,\nMarketing:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:And it's fabulous .\nProject Manager:You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ?\nMarketing:It's in the project documents {gap} .\nProject Manager:It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nUser Interface:And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Otherwise it's it's all fine .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time .\nMarketing:Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .\nProject Manager:We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We certainly are ,\nProject Manager:and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Thank you , team .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It was very productive day and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:We could draw animals on the board again .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm uh no . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You can make some animals .\nMarketing:I don't like Play-Doh , no .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh , you don't like anim\nMarketing:It's just minging . It smells so bad .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It doesn't ?\nMarketing:It does .\nUser Interface:Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nIndustrial Designer:Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\nProject Manager:I don't know if it's already sent or not .\nMarketing:No , it hasn't been .\nProject Manager:Um presumably I have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\nProject Manager:I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\nMarketing:Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I made your animal for you .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}\n", "summary": "This meeting was about the detailed design. Firstly, User Interface presented on the prototype, including the shape, the size of the remote and the user interface including the buttons and the scrolling wheel. Next, the group had an evaluation criterion on the prototype. They scored an overall six point five average on the prototype and thought they had done well on it. Then, the group had a discussion about project finance. The group decided not to have a sample sensor and the locator because they had a production cost of 12.5 Euros. Lastly, the group had a discussion about the project process, including the use of a pen, the whiteboard and the PowerPoint. Also, the group was satisfied with Project Manager's leadership and Project Manager also mentioned that their costs were within the budget as well as some admin work.", "length": 15922}
{"id": 9, "conversations": "Marketing:{vocalsound} Okay . Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it . {vocalsound} 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Ready for this ?\nProject Manager:All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:which is kind of fun .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh really ?\nProject Manager:I think . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Huh .\nProject Manager:I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah that's not you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No . That's how the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Wait .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .\nIndustrial Designer:Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:why not ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Fair enough .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Perfect .\nIndustrial Designer:Go ahead .\nUser Interface:No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:um f we call it fruity\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:if you will . Um . Right , um ,\nMarketing:Appropriate , okay .\nUser Interface:of course that's uh interchangeable\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nMarketing:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:but this is kind of something that can be done\nMarketing:It is an option .\nUser Interface:um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer:That's this here .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ah . I see .\nUser Interface:Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\nUser Interface:It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen ,\nProject Manager:Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok\nIndustrial Designer:I thought that was kinda nice .\nMarketing:Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:This was actually an apple on the inside .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:This {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} it's encased in a new uh type of uh\nMarketing:Oh okay , there's preservatives involved ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:polymer yeah .\nMarketing:we don't need to worry ,\nIndustrial Designer:We got a bit ahead of ourselves ,\nUser Interface:It's fine .\nMarketing:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:Fair enough .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's pos a possible new product .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's a couple years off at least . Okay .\nUser Interface:Um , but I think that's {disfmarker} I think that sums up the main features of our {disfmarker} of the remote ,\nProject Manager:Brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh {disfmarker} whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh we did , yeah . This cost {disfmarker} well to put this into um production , we're looking at about {disfmarker} what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um , so I was quite pleased with that .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:One thing that we didn't do um {disfmarker} obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down .\nProject Manager:Brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer:So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound} Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ?\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker} Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ?\nUser Interface:So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier\nMarketing:Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface:and um , I think that uh has given a proven um {vocalsound} ease of use and what not .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Cool .\nIndustrial Designer:Any questions ?\nProject Manager:No , no\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ?\nProject Manager:I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , do you wanna answer this one\nMarketing:Do we know where we stand on that yet ?\nIndustrial Designer:or do you want me to answer it ?\nUser Interface:Well we didn't quite have enough material uh {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Oh I see ,\nMarketing:I just didn't know {disfmarker} if you guys had any in mind yet . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:right , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , well {vocalsound} as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . Just veneer really ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface:Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that .\nMarketing:And the whole thing {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay\nUser Interface:So I mean there are {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right\nUser Interface:we definitely priced out a spongy {disfmarker} even spongier non-natural look um materials\nMarketing:Yeah . There's {disfmarker} Okay .\nUser Interface:which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .\nMarketing:Mm 'kay . Okay , very cool .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:that in the factory it could {disfmarker} we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:if you know what I mean .\nMarketing:Yep . It's still an option if we need it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Very cool , nice job .\nProject Manager:Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant . {vocalsound} Um , {vocalsound} what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me {disfmarker} you've got {disfmarker} you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um .\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh .\nProject Manager:I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like {disfmarker} So we'll just {disfmarker} if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this {disfmarker} it's a solar cell thing right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Right\nProject Manager:With a back-up battery ?\nIndustrial Designer:uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there ,\nProject Manager:With the ba okay . Um\nIndustrial Designer:yep .\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . It's just making use of the same space and the same materials ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that {disfmarker} be the general {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um . And um a special {disfmarker} I guess it's uh {disfmarker} we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that {disfmarker} throughout ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , special .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , it's it's quite unique .\nIndustrial Designer:I like to think of it as unconventional .\nProject Manager:I like it , yeah it's {disfmarker} So it looks like\nMarketing:M come in at sixteen ?\nProject Manager:a bit over budget , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . Huh , doesn't match up does it ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells {vocalsound} um or take out the back-up battery . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:How do you feel about that ?\nUser Interface:I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that {disfmarker} you know what the sell is on that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:what am I gonna do ?\nMarketing:Mm k .\nIndustrial Designer:People'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery ,\nMarketing:True .\nIndustrial Designer:it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have .\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound} What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now ,\nMarketing:Nah .\nProject Manager:it would have to be {disfmarker} seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way . Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental {disfmarker} I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing\nMarketing:I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean that's what sets us apart\nMarketing:Which , it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:right ?\nMarketing:yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here\nMarketing:Right . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here\nProject Manager:It's either or .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I guess we might have to do that .\nMarketing:I think unfortunately that's our best option .\nIndustrial Designer:It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It {disfmarker} kind of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:um and we can't get rid of the uh {disfmarker} I mean removing the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Savings .\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:changing the case wouldn't be so much of a {vocalsound} mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials .\nMarketing:Mm-mm .\nProject Manager:Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . So that would be the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it's a major change but {disfmarker} Yeah . Alright , so\nIndustrial Designer:Gotta do what you gotta do .\nProject Manager:we're in agreement on that .\nMarketing:Unfortunately I think we are .\nUser Interface:No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right . Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over .\nMarketing:That would be me . Um cord ?\nProject Manager:Ah of course , sorry .\nMarketing:No problem .\nProject Manager:Whoosh .\nMarketing:Can you reach ,\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:that would be great , thank you .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That'd be great {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I didn't even do that one on purpose either ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um {vocalsound} from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of {disfmarker} these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Really good .\nMarketing:So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . {vocalsound} So .\nUser Interface:They like that spongy feel .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . It looks like it's going over well , so\nUser Interface:And the paging function works well ,\nIndustrial Designer:Six ?\nUser Interface:that's good to hear ,\nMarketing:we're we're good yeah .\nUser Interface:we worked hard on that one .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Brilliant .\nIndustrial Designer:We did .\nMarketing:Yeah . It's {disfmarker} I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good .\nIndustrial Designer:I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel\nMarketing:That's everything from me .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but it's okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , it is a set-back , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay , do you need the cord back ?\nProject Manager:Um yeah ,\nUser Interface:W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again\nProject Manager:I was just {disfmarker} go on .\nIndustrial Designer:I know .\nUser Interface:that we're {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ?\nIndustrial Designer:True .\nUser Interface:I guess that's true .\nProject Manager:Right . So , um , {vocalsound} this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um {vocalsound} our project process um\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um {vocalsound} uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:As in within the team or ?\nProject Manager:I think so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:I think it's {disfmarker} I mm-hmm , I think so . I think {vocalsound} hope I'm not screwing up an experiment {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:It is now ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:you're in charge there you go {vocalsound} . so {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Whatever {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Um right , um so any thoughts ?\nIndustrial Designer:Are we considering these points here ?\nMarketing:Um .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:I think they're starting blocks yeah .\nProject Manager:What do you guys feel about the process ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were {vocalsound} relatively productive ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff .\nUser Interface:We didn't use the whiteboard at all .\nProject Manager:No , no whiteboard . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No , we didn't . We could now if that'd make up for it\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:but really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .\nUser Interface:Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything .\nMarketing:Yeah I think I was taking {vocalsound} notes more often than usual\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's true .\nMarketing:just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nProject Manager:Was pretty cool tack though .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Definitely .\nMarketing:Mm . I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:As you write your personal coach .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , but I didn't get a response {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} What if you get a response two or three months from now ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:we'll see {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That'd be weird .\nMarketing:Okay that would be kinda creepy .\nProject Manager:Attempts to contact coach ineffective {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I {disfmarker} so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I don't we could do whatever {disfmarker} basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um .\nMarketing:I think so . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:With the natural look .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Very natural look .\nIndustrial Designer:That's very natural .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Organic , really . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's the brilliance of {disfmarker} they had a p they had a peeler in here .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And highly resourceful team mates might I add\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:which is always a plus .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think the teamwork was good as well .\nMarketing:Mm yeah , I'm impressed .\nIndustrial Designer:And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Nice . All four of those little containers . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I guess {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:we only had four , wasn't enough .\nMarketing:You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I know it could have been amazing .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh well .\nProject Manager:What did you guys think about the the the roles ?\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:They were good {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it's f kind of fun , it was {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough .\nMarketing:True .\nIndustrial Designer:At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Do your own .\nIndustrial Designer:which was kind of fun .\nMarketing:Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all .\nProject Manager:That's true , I I got this spreadsheet {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Nothing , I didn't even get an email ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:like\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped .\nUser Interface:Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Whatever .\nProject Manager:Of what to do .\nUser Interface:well no but also {disfmarker} yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Uh-huh , that wasn't very much . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You know {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:because that was kind of the interface portion\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:which was what the whole project was about\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Mm , mm .\nUser Interface:uh\nMarketing:Hmm , very much so .\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker} and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That was fun . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you\nUser Interface:which was fine . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time .\nMarketing:Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . Very much so .\nProject Manager:Cool .\nUser Interface:And I think your leadership was quite good .\nIndustrial Designer:It was really good yeah .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:She said I I I she actually made a comment off {gap} boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get {disfmarker} I I felt like I got way too into it .\nMarketing:Yeah . That's kind of a good thing though ,\nProject Manager:I felt like I slipped into it a lot .\nIndustrial Designer:It's kinda fun .\nMarketing:you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey .\nProject Manager:I dunno .\nUser Interface:An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ?\nProject Manager:The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . I usually organise crap ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:it's one thing to do , you know {disfmarker} set up a party with your friends ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you know ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Little different .\nProject Manager:But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the {disfmarker} okay ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and I knew we were all lying through our teeth ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I had to admit , as soon as w we started {disfmarker} I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , {vocalsound} th {vocalsound} you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:other than that {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I could only imagine . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too ,\nUser Interface:Possibly .\nProject Manager:like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos {disfmarker} did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh yeah ,\nMarketing:Yeah . Totally .\nProject Manager:everybody knows {disfmarker} best spaceships ever .\nUser Interface:still have 'em .\nProject Manager:Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nMarketing:I think so .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} You don't .\nProject Manager:I don't {disfmarker} I I was just {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Though we didn't actually {disfmarker} I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't {disfmarker} except for the actual building ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's true huh ?\nMarketing:but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board {disfmarker} well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . I mean\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:That's true .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team {vocalsound} you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It d\nMarketing:Yeah that is kind of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But yeah . Interesting . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? I mean the whole process of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Wonder why {disfmarker} is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ?\nProject Manager:I don't know . {vocalsound} I I don't know if there was a ri I th\nMarketing:Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's it\nMarketing:I was afraid I was gonna break something actually .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board .\nMarketing:Yeah . True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option ,\nProject Manager:Nor I .\nMarketing:I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't .\nUser Interface:I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for .\nMarketing:True .\nUser Interface:Um , because I've got this laptop . Standard ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me .\nProject Manager:I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper .\nMarketing:Yeah . Well it looks really professional .\nProject Manager:I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized\nMarketing:I know .\nProject Manager:because my handwriting is crap .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something .\nIndustrial Designer:that's it . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . You know , like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here .\nUser Interface:So is this all we need to get through ?\nProject Manager:I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about .\nMarketing:I guess .\nIndustrial Designer:New ideas .\nMarketing:Um .\nUser Interface:Is it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It {disfmarker} did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?\nProject Manager:Well , that's the thing I got {disfmarker} i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there ,\nMarketing:That slide was like that ?\nProject Manager:mm-hmm . I didn't change this one at all .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Well .\nProject Manager:Um ch\nIndustrial Designer:I guess we're on the right track .\nProject Manager:Yeah well . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:W {gap} {vocalsound} I kinda like th\nIndustrial Designer:No , none .\nMarketing:Uh I think they still do their job .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah you can't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think they're fine actually .\nMarketing:I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different .\nMarketing:I don't {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:you know ? {vocalsound} Don't know .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um . 'Kay .\nUser Interface:What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ?\nProject Manager:So this was other costs .\nMarketing:Kind of .\nIndustrial Designer:Are we back into project mood ?\nProject Manager:I dunno . I think this is\nMarketing:Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ?\nProject Manager:forty ish\nMarketing:How much time do we have left ?\nProject Manager:I I I mm we should go on a bit {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} about the project eval , um . I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . Like , what like you know what am I really doing ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:you know what is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:and I was like {disfmarker} had like all this brainstorming I was doing\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Why ?\nProject Manager:Hey .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so type away . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Huh I think it was the real {gap} .\nMarketing:You know , you know what I mean\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore .\nIndustrial Designer:Definitely when {vocalsound} when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to {disfmarker} how much I stressed over it\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much .\nMarketing:Whatever . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Very much , yeah .\nUser Interface:which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I actually didn't do that at all though ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:every single one I {disfmarker} a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . I di\nUser Interface:Oh I added like five slides too ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} See\nProject Manager:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Did you really ?\nUser Interface:but I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I only got blank ones .\nIndustrial Designer:I just got blank ones\nProject Manager:What ? Really ?\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe\nUser Interface:Yeah , mine too .\nMarketing:and they were just empty .\nProject Manager:Did they not have {disfmarker} they didn't like {disfmarker} uh mine {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Me too .\nProject Manager:yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with {disfmarker} this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like ,\nMarketing:Like with those words already on it ?\nProject Manager:literally , just like that .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Interesting .\nMarketing:I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh huh huh .\nIndustrial Designer:I deleted slides {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think I added a slide one time .\nUser Interface:I added many slides every time {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Hey\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class .\nUser Interface:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Interesting . Any other thoughts come to mind ?\nMarketing:I wanna know how our product would fare .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I think it would fail , I think\nMarketing:I can't just leave it there .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . {vocalsound} But you know the whole {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Even you {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't {disfmarker} we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I know it is {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a happy face .\nUser Interface:Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Builds . Mm .\nUser Interface:I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I I noticed that . {vocalsound} By accident .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:that happened to be consumed . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Interesting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well huh . An interesting day all in all I would say .\nProject Manager:Uh , yeah , I'd say so .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , it's uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not .\nProject Manager:Mm , I know .\nMarketing:I know .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce\nIndustrial Designer:I wanna see a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I Yeah .\nProject Manager:although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . Well the id okay the notion of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Cause it's such a functional item .\nProject Manager:yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . You know ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of {disfmarker} we sh I I thought of I thought of {disfmarker} rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I dunno . But . All in all it's kinda interesting .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:So we have more slides or ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:We got it to be .\nProject Manager:We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nMarketing:Like cutting corners . Kind of ,\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nProject Manager:Mm . True .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .\nProject Manager:Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yay .\nProject Manager:I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .\nIndustrial Designer:I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Nice .\nMarketing:I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nProject Manager:Oh yeah .\nMarketing:that mean nothing .\nProject Manager:There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nIndustrial Designer:Really .\nUser Interface:What the uhs and the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Filler words or ?\nProject Manager:Yep , they're called um disfluencies .\nIndustrial Designer:Disfluencies .\nMarketing:That's a good word for it .\nProject Manager:Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nProject Manager:Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents .\nIndustrial Designer:I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:I , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:like c come on gimme something .\nMarketing:pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Come on give me some information .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , we are addicts .\nUser Interface:That's scary\nIndustrial Designer:It is scary .\nUser Interface:yeah ?\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nMarketing:I yeah .\nUser Interface:Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nMarketing:True .\nProject Manager:No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nMarketing:I yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .\nIndustrial Designer:It's crazy . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:In the eighties ?\nMarketing:My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:because it hadn't been\nUser Interface:Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .\nMarketing:partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .\nUser Interface:You guys ready to celebrate ?\nProject Manager:Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .\nMarketing:Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Should .\nProject Manager:'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nMarketing:I think so . I think that's a closer .\nProject Manager:Cool .\nIndustrial Designer:Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Celebrate .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Where do you find that ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I have no idea .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Is that the only song you have ?\nUser Interface:There is another one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Is this one of those media player ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Huh ?\nProject Manager:W oh .\nIndustrial Designer:That's awesome .\nUser Interface:Yep . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe I have a different one .\nProject Manager:That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .\nMarketing:So is that a close ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner .\nMarketing:Okay , that's the end of the meeting .\nProject Manager:Fab .\nMarketing:Thank you gentlemen . I feel like I'm signing off .\n", "summary": "This was the last meeting of their work.

{"id": 12, "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay . So , now um , {vocalsound} last time . Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button ? {vocalsound} One time please . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't care . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh this , you mean ?\nProject Manager:Yes . The prototype .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh ?\nUser Interface:Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} This is it .\nProject Manager:Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:the sides .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:until here or something .\nMarketing:Yes .\nUser Interface:And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break .\nProject Manager:Okay . And the buttons ?\nUser Interface:Uh , well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Big . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nUser Interface:Uh , yes . Yes ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Very obvious .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\nIndustrial Designer:The R_R_ ?\nProject Manager:Okay . Very good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , we have {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's on the rub rubber part .\nUser Interface:Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .\nProject Manager:So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nProject Manager:So , that's it . That's prototype .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nProject Manager:Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay .\nMarketing:Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , I'm gonna look .\nMarketing:Do we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We have {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Do we change the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nMarketing:Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\nProject Manager:Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Sorry .\nMarketing:That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Criteria .\nMarketing:You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager:No , it's okay .\nMarketing:Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll get it .\nProject Manager:Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing:Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager:What do you think ?\nMarketing:Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager:{gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry , six .\nMarketing:So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , true or false .\nMarketing:And you {gap} true or false .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .\nMarketing:And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Two .\nIndustrial Designer:Sorry .\nProject Manager:You ?\nUser Interface:Three .\nProject Manager:Me too . So it's a three .\nMarketing:'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .\nUser Interface:Mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .\nProject Manager:So it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's uh a six .\nIndustrial Designer:Five .\nUser Interface:Mm , four .\nProject Manager:Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So I think it's four .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but\nProject Manager:Yes . So , I think it's four .\nUser Interface:older {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager:Okay . Give it a four .\nIndustrial Designer:Four .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:Four . Uh , okay . Mm .\nProject Manager:We put the fashion in electronics .\nMarketing:That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer:Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes . Two .\nProject Manager:Uh , I say uh a five .\nMarketing:Two .\nProject Manager:It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't .\nIndustrial Designer:It {disfmarker} it will be fashion .\nProject Manager:Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Then make it th three .\nMarketing:Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too .\nProject Manager:No . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . Three is okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , agree ?\nProject Manager:I use my feet though . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} A three .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .\nIndustrial Designer:I give it a one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} . Yes , a one . I like it .\nProject Manager:Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:We have to do our uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Say two .\nMarketing:Two or three ?\nProject Manager:Okay , two .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nMarketing:Two . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .\nIndustrial Designer:One .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You ?\nUser Interface:One . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Me too . One .\nMarketing:One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Next , six . It does not get lost easily .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Just a small thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah . Yellow .\nProject Manager:I don't think so .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Looks like a pistol .\nProject Manager:Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .\nProject Manager:No . It won't get lost .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It won't .\nProject Manager:A one ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , o one .\nProject Manager:Okay , a one .\nMarketing:One .\nProject Manager:Next .\nMarketing:Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .\nProject Manager:Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Me too .\nProject Manager:That was our target . Two .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ? Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel .\nMarketing:Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T\nIndustrial Designer:I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yes , a one .\nProject Manager:I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:So I think s two is better .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Two is okay .\nMarketing:Okay . Two .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .\nProject Manager:No , it's new . Innovation .\nMarketing:If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nMarketing:So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm , three .\nProject Manager:Me too . Three .\nMarketing:A three .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .\nProject Manager:Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .\nMarketing:So , we will do that . Yes .\nProject Manager:Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .\nMarketing:By nine .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nMarketing:Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:Come on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh , nah . Okay .\nMarketing:So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , it's good .\nMarketing:So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think {gap} .\nMarketing:Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And I closed your slide-show .\nProject Manager:Back to my uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .\nProject Manager:Yep . Next please .\nMarketing:Next . Finance .\nProject Manager:So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Cheapest there is .\nProject Manager:Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .\nIndustrial Designer:Expensive .\nProject Manager:Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , it's the most advanced .\nProject Manager:We have the simple , regular and advanced .\nIndustrial Designer:Advanced .\nProject Manager:We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .\nUser Interface:Mm , yes .\nProject Manager:No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , yellow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager:Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?\nIndustrial Designer:One .\nMarketing:One .\nProject Manager:And it's not really a s\nIndustrial Designer:Joystick uh thing .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .\nUser Interface:Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager:So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh , no . It's too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh\nProject Manager:So , we have to change something .\nIndustrial Designer:What what are the costs ?\nProject Manager:Fifteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Fifteen .\nProject Manager:Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour .\nMarketing:{gap} . We would have uh n\nIndustrial Designer:A special colour .\nProject Manager:Oh , no , we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .\nProject Manager:No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?\nMarketing:For a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} What ?\nMarketing:I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .\nProject Manager:Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?\nProject Manager:That's one Euro .\nIndustrial Designer:One Euro discount . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .\nProject Manager:Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?\nProject Manager:So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh .\nProject Manager:Then it's not good anymore .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yellow rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:No one will see it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , normal .\nIndustrial Designer:Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And it's twelve Euros , I think .\nProject Manager:One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer:No . Uh , no , no , no .\nProject Manager:Or it's then a regular ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait .\nMarketing:The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing:If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing:If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager:Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager:Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface:Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer:So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface:Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Very good .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:About the\nProject Manager:About the project .\nMarketing:Project .\nIndustrial Designer:process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager:Okay . And you .\nUser Interface:Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager:So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ? Okay then .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\n", "summary": "Firstly, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was half rubber and half plastic with a yellow case. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of the market trend as well as the customers' taste and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product.Thirdly, the team found that the current product exceeded the budget, so the team decided to discard joystick and use only one material with the normal color but the team agreed to keep the LCD as well as the advanced chips.

{"id": 13, "conversations": "Project Manager:Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the {disfmarker} in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's {disfmarker} the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's {disfmarker} we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Let me {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Right s {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we've got forty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um mm , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Let's hope the pen holds out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:okay , so basically I'll start off by {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to {disfmarker} connect that anyway {disfmarker} brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:uh {vocalsound} everything else is kind of {disfmarker} Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:on pressing this button I {disfmarker} a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . {vocalsound} So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our {disfmarker} uh the cells , yeah ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh thes these are the kind {disfmarker} different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Does that mean like a wind-up one ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} A wind-up remote .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh I don't know if {disfmarker} even if you want to consider this ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So {vocalsound} the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .\nMarketing:You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And charging their remote ,\nMarketing:Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a good option .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} So what was what was this k ka\nIndustrial Designer:The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also {vocalsound} made by the company .\nMarketing:Yay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Environment friendly . Okay {vocalsound} um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective .\nProject Manager:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:There are different cases that can be provided . They can be {disfmarker} basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and they can be curved with {disfmarker} on both the sides .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} These are the three options , right ? Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:mm-hmm . Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Wo wo wood .\nMarketing:Did you say wool ?\nProject Manager:Wood , wood .\nMarketing:Wood . Oh right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} Not wool . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} A fluffy remote . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh really ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Huh .\nIndustrial Designer:so uh we can use even um {vocalsound} a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh {vocalsound} uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay , the interface options now . So {vocalsound} we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sony .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , something like that .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So , and they have {disfmarker} they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The scroll plus push . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um {vocalsound} in the last decade , so not too recent . And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} The various electronic options are um uh {vocalsound} so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh {disfmarker} so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:or a regular or advanced . And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {vocalsound} okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um the {disfmarker} we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . Right ? Um {vocalsound} and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is {vocalsound} {disfmarker} did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {vocalsound} and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So , these are the different options that we have . Okay , so {vocalsound} th that's that's basically {disfmarker} now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um {vocalsound} uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Excellent . Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah .\nProject Manager:you can sit down , but just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we might need you to leap up .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:What are you , PowerPoint , or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Oh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ?\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Some sort of radiation ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No it's got its little camera in there , {vocalsound} plug it in {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah .\nMarketing:'S a\nProject Manager:Right , interface concept .\nUser Interface:Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the {disfmarker} this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk .\nProject Manager:That's fine .\nUser Interface:So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I {vocalsound} I can just mention them aw again .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay . So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which {disfmarker} uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um um the method I {vocalsound} employed this time was {vocalsound} a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and {vocalsound} also um {vocalsound} whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um {vocalsound} and then um {vocalsound} this uh this um {vocalsound} this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So some findings um {vocalsound} um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um {vocalsound} okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um {vocalsound} well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:sorry for that . 'S go back .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's nice one .\nUser Interface:Ah , no , please . Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually {vocalsound} of the {disfmarker} of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least {disfmarker} uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice .\nMarketing:Ugly .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um okay . So let's carry on with this . Um {disfmarker} So uh um o other findings {disfmarker} um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . {vocalsound} Our own company has developed a new in user interface {disfmarker} uh wait , no this is not the one . Okay , there is a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows {disfmarker} i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display .\nProject Manager:It's {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed {vocalsound} a new um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh programmable speech uh {vocalsound} mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's {disfmarker} it should be .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's {disfmarker} once once the mm {vocalsound} um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh , hi {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:So {vocalsound} I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um {vocalsound} uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh {vocalsound} oh yeah are th\nProject Manager:It's like the {disfmarker} like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel .\nMarketing:Yeah , you can't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} just a moment , I'll {vocalsound} I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um {vocalsound} it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah .\nUser Interface:Look , this one here .\nMarketing:Oh , it's like the iPod .\nUser Interface:But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round ,\nMarketing:G yeah , no , you can .\nUser Interface:it's like you press this or this or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's like it's like where you {disfmarker} you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright , right . Okay , okay .\nMarketing:and it {disfmarker} yeah . It is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So instead of going down you just spin {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:You just go round\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:but you've got a lot less control over it .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . So maybe I should include that here as well ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:L_C_D_s um plus spinning .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:It {vocalsound} it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . Um and I I also thought uh {vocalsound} if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is {vocalsound} uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So yeah , that's uh that's it .\nProject Manager:Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in um the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The project documents .\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Cool .\nProject Manager:Here it comes . Okay .\nMarketing:Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay . Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So um {vocalsound} uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ?\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , sure . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . So mm uh so it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's over on the interface ,\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} yeah ,\nProject Manager:if if you could put {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and an\nProject Manager:And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ ,\nProject Manager:so that means we need an advanced thing .\nIndustrial Designer:I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . {gap}\nMarketing:so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen ,\nMarketing:You know ? Yeah .\nProject Manager:so if you're watching something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's true , yeah , that's also {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And i it would be like {disfmarker} I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that\nIndustrial Designer:Mm right .\nMarketing:and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and ,\nProject Manager:And then you can flip it open .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think so .\nMarketing:Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You you agree ? Maarika , yeah ?\nUser Interface:Yep , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely .\nMarketing:Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Go on .\nMarketing:Cool . Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sorry , I discovered clip art . {vocalsound} Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . Do you know ? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and possibly even uneven ,\nMarketing:Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff .\nProject Manager:like not not symmet yeah .\nMarketing:But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:because {disfmarker} I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so you wanna {disfmarker} you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Um yeah\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:, I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Something a bit squishy and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , we we have\nMarketing:but I mean y you have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So it could be like a rubbery {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:we have rubber ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} yeah , uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the {disfmarker} um with using {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh {disfmarker} an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:To some degree .\nIndustrial Designer:So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint ,\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:so um we could use {vocalsound} titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , w energy source .\nMarketing:If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} From {vocalsound} from bouncing it .\nMarketing:you could just {vocalsound} bounce it up and down {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound} Um so yeah , um okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ?\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:It uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No , I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:but it's curvy , so .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh I think uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , 'cause the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ?\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh\nProject Manager:Dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:because um {vocalsound} according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is {disfmarker} are these three . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all .\nProject Manager:Nothing to {vocalsound} open them .\nMarketing:Yeah . Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:'cause I had nothing better to do with my time .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , cool .\nProject Manager:Anything else ? What've we got ?\nMarketing:Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool , thanks .\nProject Manager:Okay , so .\nMarketing:Okay ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Thanks\nProject Manager:Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Let's let's try to r rub off things and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , rub off some of those .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , so um {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? {vocalsound} You you got a wind {gap} dynamo , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah uh-hum yeah .\nProject Manager:it's not {disfmarker} that's not streamlined and sexy , {vocalsound} having a having a wind up .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um {vocalsound} kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal ,\nProject Manager:I think tha\nIndustrial Designer:but uh {vocalsound} it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving ,\nMarketing:I mean if {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Depends how much how much movement it really needs .\nIndustrial Designer:Kinetic energy it needs {disfmarker} I don't have too much technical information on that ,\nProject Manager:Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , right . Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option ,\nProject Manager:I'd I'd keep it on .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Um {vocalsound} the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah .\nProject Manager:We don't want that\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah\nProject Manager:it's no {disfmarker} it's not not vegetable .\nUser Interface:it's {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um {vocalsound} okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:N wood is {disfmarker} I can't n {vocalsound} how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:you can't make it like thin and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:I can't imagine a m wooden remote control .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:The wood thing . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case {disfmarker} you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound} if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break ,\nUser Interface:wi mm-mm yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:it's it's much more uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:U yeah wood is not really {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Well it's not very cleanable either ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's true .\nMarketing:do you know .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's it's not {vocalsound} a practical {disfmarker} I mean it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:And splinters and stuff and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:okay {vocalsound} wood is out .\nMarketing:It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but uh it seems to be {vocalsound} out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , but you {disfmarker} um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm right .\nMarketing:G yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so for channel numbers but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display .\nUser Interface:But I th yeah but {vocalsound} I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of {disfmarker} yeah , it's faster\nProject Manager:Just for fast {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um {vocalsound} discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but it's it it's more time-consuming .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm right .\nProject Manager:And it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah {vocalsound} L_ {disfmarker} L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers ,\nIndustrial Designer:The numbers .\nUser Interface:because it's {disfmarker} uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:Or {vocalsound} on the L_C_D_ we can , you know {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:G yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , I would say buttons ,\nMarketing:I would think buttons , yeah .\nProject Manager:Buttons .\nUser Interface:because it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:It's it's the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote ,\nUser Interface:I\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and {disfmarker} they should be able to do that and it should be accessible ,\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:but , you know , I mean most of the time {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay , so buttons definitely in but {disfmarker} oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think that's what {vocalsound} you guys are gonna do next ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh okay .\nProject Manager:so if we put down the key um {vocalsound} things that we want .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , okay , so the components .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ?\nUser Interface:Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I {vocalsound} yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it {vocalsound} it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} E either or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it's uh {disfmarker} you can al include everything in the spinning if you\nMarketing:G yeah .\nProject Manager:Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say .\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel ,\nUser Interface:in that case .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:so you have to decide whether {disfmarker} you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole {disfmarker} if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But if you've got a {disfmarker} if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half .\nUser Interface:Ah , but I mean you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side .\nProject Manager:Th {vocalsound} that would be on one side , uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . {vocalsound} Uh i it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I um I think so too , I mean the case would be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You want an outside of rubber\nUser Interface:yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons ,\nMarketing:and then open it up and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:rubber buttons , but then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Or maybe like interchangeable cases .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it\nIndustrial Designer:Right , right .\nMarketing:and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Right ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . Yeah , and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's right ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:that's what they're after .\nIndustrial Designer:So I'll rub that out . {vocalsound} And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than {disfmarker} Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah I think we {disfmarker} um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .\nProject Manager:I guess .\nUser Interface:Yeah , does {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Bananas . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Banana's yellow , {vocalsound} yeah , definitely .\nMarketing:Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote {vocalsound} the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple\nProject Manager:Green . Yeah .\nMarketing:and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . Um {vocalsound} okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} We need the advanced {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so {vocalsound} it seems to be one area where we would want to spend .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So I'll rub off the other two .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That was the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh is {disfmarker} oh the constraint was uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} If {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:We can't have solar panels with rubber , so .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:solar panels with the rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Shall we go for {disfmarker} if we're going for rubber , we think uh on {disfmarker} as our case , and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We've got five more minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:we'll have uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:But it does not hold any advantages as such for a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:It's just a gimmick .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ye yeah , {vocalsound} we we don't have too much information about it , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but if it's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but it it {disfmarker} I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's from the company , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .\nIndustrial Designer:Flat on the top . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Can I pull the {vocalsound} thing out the back of your computer ?\nMarketing:Yeah , sure j\nProject Manager:Just so we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sorry , do you want me to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Nothing , it's right , I'm just {disfmarker} There we go .\nMarketing:What does um I_C_S_ mean ?\nIndustrial Designer:I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits .\nMarketing:Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh oh now I've gone too far .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . {vocalsound} So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and it's gonna look sort of vegetable ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} and be in bright vegetable colours .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh . So {vocalsound} w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Imagine it would be inside .\nProject Manager:I think it's on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:So um actually that could like really cut down your thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:You've maybe got , you know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel ,\nProject Manager:On the {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel ,\nProject Manager:In the centre ,\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah , sure .\nUser Interface:Mm yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Cool .\nProject Manager:Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so {disfmarker} in case we have to refer to it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own .\nProject Manager:Y ah nobody wants to talk to you .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I know , I'm hated .\nProject Manager:Unplug yourself .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I've got a bit tangled up in all this {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So but {disfmarker} shall I move away first or shall I stay here with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I dunno , maybe I would car\nUser Interface:we need to {disfmarker}\n", "summary": "This meeting was about technical design. Firstly, the group had three presentations on remote components, user interface and market trends. They presented remote control features including the circuit board, the chip, the kinetic energy, the interface mechanism of operation, the scroll wheel to be added as well as the LCD and spinning innovation. Then, the group had a discussion about the key remote concepts. They decided to have a LCD display with a spinning wheel. They would not have hand dynamos, instead, they would have a wind dynamo. And they would keep the kinetic energy as an option and look at more spongy material preferences with rubber or plastic.", "length": 14658}
{"id": 15, "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM:Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales—a child who's in critical care—but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And in terms—[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM:Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry—with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM:Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Siân could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM:I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, Siân, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM:Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM:At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care—. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is—it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped. If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM:[Inaudible.]—Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM:Hello. Yes, those are the questions I had on that section.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Lovely. Thank you very much. Right, we'll move on now then to some question on access to health services from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. Minister, just some concern that you will have heard about in terms of parents and carers maybe not taking their children into the healthcare system for other conditions while the coronavirus pandemic is with us. How are you monitoring that situation at the moment and have you had to look at your own commutation strategy in relation to that?\nVaughan Gething AM:We've had to look at some specifics around communication, so challenges about not just different languages, but about how we get messages to people in a very different environment, and it's really challenging. So, for example, our health visitor service has absolutely not stopped. We've had to think about the way it works, and I had this conversation earlier this week with the chief nurse. But the bigger challenge are parents refusing to engage with the service. I understand people's fear and anxiety, but that then means that their family, and in particular their child, isn't getting the sort of proactive care that we would want them to have. So, there's a real concern both at the professional leadership end and for the chief nurse and for Ministers as well about how we can get through. That's actually about rebuilding people's confidence in the service, and that isn't straightforward because there's a broader concern about coronavirus still circulating. But I think for us it's really important to reiterate that we have thought again about how to provide the service. We've thought about how to protect staff and families and the very clear message to parents is to please make sure that when health and care professionals are calling to help and support your family, please discuss your concerns with them. We're doing even more remotely, via telephone and online as well. There are times you need to be physically in the same place, for example on routine vaccinations, because we certainly haven't stopped that programme either, and I really wouldn't want to see that one of the unintended consequences of what we've done is that if parents don't engage with that service, we could potentially see a rise in other diseases. We're all, I think—not just you in your constituency, but others who are on this call and others as well—seeing an occasional reappearance of measles, and that's because people didn't engage with the vaccination programme. I don't want, either myself or a different health Minister in the future, to be sat here talking about how in years to come the failure to engage in a vaccination programme has led to clearly avoidable but significant harm to children and young people and the communities they live in.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Jean, you wanted to come in.\nVaughan Gething AM:You need to unmute yourself. Oh, no—\nProfessor Jean White:Thank you. I just want to add to what the Minister said. So, I approached the immunisation lead in Public Health Wales to see exactly what has been happening recently and they said at the very beginning of the outbreak parents were very reluctant about coming forward for their routine immunisations, but recently, through lots of energy from the immunisation clinics and the leads within it reaching out to families, that trend seems to have turned and there's now a much better attendance. One of the most important things we can do to protect our children is to make sure they have their vaccinations. So, yes, there was a bit of a downturn, but it does seem to be improving at the moment. Thank you.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay, thank you. And that answered my second question, Chair, so I'm happy to leave it there. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you very much. We're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from Siân Gwenllian. Siân.\nSian Gwenllian AM:It's a cause of great concern to us all, of course, in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people. So, what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place?\nVaughan Gething AM:Again, I think it's helpful that you've already heard from the education Minister last week, because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children. So, children's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister. Part of the honest challenge, again, is that we don't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact. So, we're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference. Until we have more contact with families, we may not fully understand that, and that's a real point of concern for me. In all of the unknowns within this, the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them, because we're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health, how we support people, and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need, and then how we need to think about that. Obviously, it's a key factor for their return to school, but, actually, for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment, and that will be difficult because we're going to phase out of lockdown—it's not going to be a one-hit measure. That absolutely isn't going to happen. We're going to be looking at, at each point, what difference has been made, what more we can do. And, again, there are the efforts we're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support services—that we keep on reminding people that they're there and are available, and we want people to make use of them, because I know, as this committee said, we'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future.\nSian Gwenllian AM:So, in reality, there's been no assessment undertaken because it's difficult to do that. So, the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisis—you don't know what they are at the moment as things stand.\nVaughan Gething AM:We can't know, because we don't have that level of contact. There is a development—. I wouldn't say that no work's being done, but I couldn't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture. If I tried to say that, then I'm sure you'd ask me, 'How on earth can you say that? If you're not having regular contact with people, you can't possibly understand the picture.' And it's much better to say, 'We don't understand the full picture. We know there'll have been an impact. We're working alongside health boards and others, but we'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families.' I'll look at a variety of different areas, again, both to reform the recovery plan, but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future, and the picture that we're seeing isn't straightforward and we need to make sure that we don't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we'd want to be.\nSian Gwenllian AM:But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister?\nVaughan Gething AM:Of course. Not just on the work we've done in the past; not just because it's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools, but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and to move forwards, that we don't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we haven't thought about what that will look like. So, the mental health recovery plan will of course be of very real importance to me. In amongst all the other priorities I have, I'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS, for example, in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus?\nVaughan Gething AM:No, we've actually got—. Maybe perhaps it might be helpful, Chair, if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we're monitoring the impact we have, in terms of we've got a reporting tool, but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services.\nLynne Neagle AM:Tracey.\nTracey Breheny:Of course. Thanks, Minister. Yes, on that question, we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place, as the Minister said, a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards, so through that tool, we look at that every week in terms of collecting information. Whilst national reporting's been stood down, we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services, referral numbers and so on, so we do have that tool in place, and at the moment, that's telling us that the system can meet the capacity; has the capacity to meet need.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak?\nTracey Breheny:There has been some movement, as I'm saying, around health boards, particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision, providing critical care, but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week, those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever, or from different parts of the system.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And then, what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients? Because that's what I'm hearing, that there has been such a reduction, but how are those patients then treated and served?\nTracey Breheny:In terms of in-patient capacity, that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment. There were some discharges of young people, but we've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And finally in this section from me, given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services, how can young people access appropriate services—online services, for example? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment?\nVaughan Gething AM:Well, we've not closed off general practice and, as you know, we've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner. We've expanded a range of telephone advice services, so the telephone advice service we already provide, we've made sure that's maintained, and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions. I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas. That is, again, a worry for me, but the communications we have within the health and care system, people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available, and actually, as I say, we've expanded that right across our healthcare system. That's what I’m keen to see continue into the future. Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is, I don't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services. Of course, most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already.\nSian Gwenllian AM:But, of course, there will be some who are missed; they may fall between two stools because they won’t know where to turn.\nVaughan Gething AM:Yes, and that, again, comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context, with their families, to know where support and advice and guidance is. Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they can't find advice somewhere else, so that's why there's the information we're providing through general practice to signpost people, so those pathways haven’t been closed off. It's about making sure that people have alternative means that they’re prepared to use at this point in time. If we go back to where we started this evidence session, we were talking about the difficulty of families who don't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home. So, there's a real challenge about how we make the service available, but then encourage people to take it up, so that we don’t see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. I've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies, and can I remind Ministers about concise answers, please? Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, thank you. Just as we're speaking about children and young people's mental health, I wonder if you can confirm whether you've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people, and whether the operational guidance you've given out is responding to that in any way, or maybe there was something in that that you hadn’t thought of and you can respond to as we go along.\nVaughan Gething AM:I, personally, haven't read that advice, but the Government's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions. You don't need to be a parent to recognise that that’s a potential issue for children and young people. But, I'm sure—. I haven't read it, but that's been signposted, so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we're already adopting, because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources, including the UN, the World Health Organization and others.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, and we are going to come onto children's rights. But, as you know, Minister, the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart. Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic?\nVaughan Gething AM:Apart from the general concern that I've expressed on mental health generally, we are already investigating, we're having a—. We've commissioned, through the Government, the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group, including Dr Ann John and other people, to review the current, unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales, because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. So, that's why we've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have, so we're able then to provide a report to understand where we are. My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and, obviously, I know the committee’s got an interest, so if it's helpful we can write to you once we've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it.\nLynne Neagle AM:Yes, please. Thank you. In terms of provision of crisis care, then, how has that been impacted by the pandemic? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment?\nVaughan Gething AM:Yes, they continue to be available. We still have seven-day-a-week crisis care. We've made clear that mental health services, including those for children and young people, are essential services to be provided. They're not services to be scaled down. They were not part of the series of measures that I stopped within the health service on 13 March. We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time, and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Moving on to perinatal mental health, this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period, but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother, let alone in a pandemic.\nVaughan Gething AM:We continue, again, to provide our perinatal mental health service. That's not been stopped either. We've also been looking at how that's provided on a phone or online basis where possible, because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people. So, we're looking to make sure that the progress isn't lost that we've made. We know there is more to go. So, the service may have changed, but it still absolutely exists. And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to. So, I want to understand what that really means, but again the problem is, at this point in the pandemic, I can't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision. We're still committed to it, but I'm concerned about the time frame—that is partly about the length and the extent. But again, I'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time. It's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times, about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they'd want, and even more so now.\nLynne Neagle AM:Is the Welsh Government aware that there's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision, and will you be taking that into account in your planning? Because, obviously, we wouldn't want people to think that was because of a lack of need; it's down to fear and the lockdown.\nVaughan Gething AM:Yes, we're aware there's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service—or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase—because we know that's the same with a range of other areas. There aren't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus. So, I certainly wouldn't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create. So, I'm happy to give that assurance, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. The next questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you, Chair. It's a straightforward one, really. Obviously, we have the detail of the third sector resilience fund and the—there are two funds, aren't there, for third sector organisations? But can you give us some indication of how much of that support is being targeted to children and young people, and perhaps you can specifically mention how much of the £6.3 million for hospices is for children's hospices? I don't mind who answers that one.\nLynne Neagle AM:The Deputy Minister would like to come in, I think.\nJulie Morgan AM:Yes. Certainly, I'm sure the committee is aware, as Suzy has said, of the funds that are available for third sector services. The Deputy Minister and the Chief Whip, of course, announced on 6 April the £24 million Welsh Government third sector COVID-19 response fund, and that of course is more than we would have had as a result of consequentials from the UK Government. They can also benefit from the £400 million economic resilience fund, but I am aware that some groups don't benefit from that and they may not qualify for that. So, we've also got third sector support being delivered by WCVA, such as the voluntary services emergency fund, which supports volunteering, and the third sector resilience fund, supporting organisations to stay afloat. We are working very closely with the third sector on issues such as support for fostering services, care leavers and repurposing funding so that they can support the crises. Voices from Care Cymru has developed a specific offer for care leavers, and the Fostering Network provides extended helplines. We've got lots of examples of third sector partners working with children and young people. Childline bases in Wales remain open and operational, and are still providing information and support. And, actually, about 50 per cent of contact with Childline at the moment is to do with COVID-19. NSPCC has put together a support page for young people about COVID-19. The NSPCC UK helpline have also reported a decrease in calls resulting in a referral to children's social services at the start of the lockdown period, but, since then, the numbers have actually risen. So, there are lots of examples of help for children. Meic, Action for Children, and, of course, Voices From Care Cymru have come up with their own specific package. In terms of the actual percentage that is being spent on children, I can't give you an actual figure for that, but, certainly, there are a whole range of projects that are there helping children. I think the Minister for Health and Social Services will be able to respond to the hospice question.\nVaughan Gething AM:It's about £1.5 million from the £6.3 million that's gone to Tŷ Gobaith and Tŷ Hafan, Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you very much for that. So, it's about 25 per cent. Perhaps if you could ask the Deputy Minister, when she's in a position to do so, to let us have a note. Before we finish on this point, could I ask the Deputy Minister, again, about whether any of the things you've been talking about now is additional money, because, obviously, you mentioned yourself one of these funds is £24 million. Some of the work you mentioned is continuity of existing work. So, again, if you don't have the answer to hand, perhaps you could send us a note in due course about how much extra is going in.\nJulie Morgan AM:Yes. I think most of those things I mentioned are things that are already there, and the £24 million is for support and extra help. So, any more information, I can send to you.\nSuzy Davies AM:Lovely. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you very much. The next questions, then, are from Dawn Bowden on safeguarding and child protection.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round. I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently, and it's really how we are monitoring it, what concerns have been identified, and how we're going to start to tackle some of those.\nJulie Morgan AM:Yes. Thank you very much, Dawn, for that question. Obviously, it is difficult to monitor if there's not easy access to the children that we're referring to, and that's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings. And there's been a lot of encouragement for that happen. The Minister, the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities, asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school. In fact, we've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings, and that's the highest number that we've had at all since the opening of the scheme. But it's still only a tiny drop in the ocean. But it's very good, and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up. But, of course, there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing. There has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services. Those numbers are now beginning to go up, but there certainly was a significant drop, which is a great deal of concern. One local authority, in fact, reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year. So, I issued a written statement on 1 May, setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children, young people and safeguarding work stream, and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are. Because, obviously, we are dependent on the public authorities—you know, schools and health services—to report any concerns, and at the moment, obviously, they're not there to report them. So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what Siân Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done.\nLynne Neagle AM:Jean, you wanted to come in on that.\nProfessor Jean White:Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. That covers both Flying Start and general health visiting areas. Thank you.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. So,it's just looking at the current guidance that we have. Do you think that needs revisiting at all?\nJulie Morgan AM:The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care—the children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. Those are the ones that we also want to support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you, Chair. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern?\nJulie Morgan AM:Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. Also, there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities. There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children's services. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. So, there's very close contact. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that.\nLynne Neagle AM:I think we'll move on to the next section. Can I remind everyone again: sharp focused questions and concise answers? Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thanks. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks?\nJulie Morgan AM:It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced £3 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. So, we do normally ensure that they've got digital contact for social workers.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed?\nJulie Morgan AM:Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. So, I'm very pleased to report that. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it’s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. In terms of residential care, Hillside is functioning well—no reporting issues. The staffing levels are normal. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. So, I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. So, I don't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Okay. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines?\nJulie Morgan AM:We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. We're working with the third sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from Care—I mentioned them before—have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now—that they have contact with. But that's online help for them. So, we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please?\nJulie Morgan AM:Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and things—have helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. Albert, I just wanted to check there wasn't anything you wanted to add, please.\nAlbert Heaney:Thank you very much, Chair. I think the only thing to add was relating to monitoring. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. So, that will assist us in our monitoring arrangements going forward. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you very much. And the next questions, then, are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister, I think, about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed, about which children's rights impact assessments have been done. Have any been done, and can they be shared with the committee if they have? Sorry, Deputy Minister—my mistake.\nJulie Morgan AM:Well, it's been a very difficult time, as you appreciate, in terms of having to make legislation very quickly, and it hasn't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do. However, I am very pleased to say that we're actually launching a survey of children. We're going to be launching it next week. And this is to try to get from children their views of what's happened, what we've been doing, and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation. So, we're doing this in conjunction with the children's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament. So, this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children, and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them, what they feel about what's happened during this period, what they feel about the way that we've dealt with the schools, the way that they've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long. And so we're trying to get feedback from young people. So, I'm very pleased that we're doing that, but, in terms of an impact assessment, it has been very difficult, as I'm sure you can imagine, to be able to do those at these times. I think that Albert wants to come in on that.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, because I'll pursue that in a sec.\nLynne Neagle AM:Albert.\nAlbert Heaney:Thank you. Thank you, Chair, and I think Nicola indicated before me, so apologies, Nicola. Just to say for the committee, really importantly, that we haven't introduced any easements in relation to children's services legislation. I think that's really quite crucial. So, from a Welsh context, the standards that are in place do remain, so therefore there wouldn't have been a necessity for us to do a children's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation. I think that's particularly a strong point to us in Wales, both in terms of safeguarding arrangements, but also ensuring that children's rights are protected at a crucial time.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Nicola.\nNicola Edwards:Thanks. In terms of childcare and education, we're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements, and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those. Obviously, the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments, but, in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space—and I think Albert was just saying the same thing—we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. Well, just to come back on that then, are you saying to me that, as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we've had, no assessments for children's needs have been postponed, cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person?\nJulie Morgan AM:Well, I think, as Albert said, that there was no relaxation of regulation for children's social care. You know, that's—there haven't been any in Wales.\nSuzy Davies AM:No, but that's what—. There's no relaxation, but what's happening in practice? We're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors—who's doing the children's needs assessments, particularly for young carers?\nJulie Morgan AM:Well, I—. Albert, can you answer that?\nAlbert Heaney:I think the first thing to say to the committee is that, going back, we took a very strong line at the beginning that we weren't going to introduce easements in requirements to children's social services. Of course, through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate, they are having to operate through a different time. So, assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns; assessments are still taking place, and especially in relation to—as you mentioned—young carers, to support their needs. So, arrangements—[Inaudible.] But they're having to be slightly differently done—so, some of the technology, and keeping in contact and keeping those visits. So, we've used, for example, the St David's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well. So, we're having to be a little bit more—and social services departments are having to be a little bit more—innovative in the use of technology in the way that they've engaged as well. But personal visits are taking place, and visits especially, as the Minister mentioned earlier on—they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits, to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. Thank you. I don't want to take this much further, but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic. I just want to finish with this one question, if I may. We've had recommendations from the Carers Trust, or Carers Trust Wales. Have they been accepted by Government, and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day, Deputy Minister?\nJulie Morgan AM:Well, those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group. I've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues, and we are setting up this group, as you know, and we will be looking at those issues in the group.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. Thank you. Any steal on when that might report?\nJulie Morgan AM:I don't have that at the moment.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Maybe we could have a note on that, Deputy Minister. Can I just say, we are running short of time? We did start late, so, if the Ministers are happy, we'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.—3.10 p.m.—if that's okay. And the next questions are from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:[Inaudible.]\nLynne Neagle AM:Hold on a sec, Siân, we've lost translation again. Can we just see what can be done to get the translation back? Sorry, Siân. Is there anyone who can help with the translation? There you go, Siân. Thank you.\nSian Gwenllian AM:You will know, Deputy Minister—because we have discussed this in private session—my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector, and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis, as families start to return to the workplace. There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and aren't receiving financial support. Do you agree—are there people who are still not being supported, and why isn't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector?\nJulie Morgan AM:Thank you, Siân, for that question. And I know that we have had a discussion about this before. Basically, we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops. We have guaranteed that we will pay the money for the childcare offer for three months. So, that is guaranteed to them, and they are able to take advantage of the Government's job retainer scheme, but that does mean that there is a problem, as I think we've discussed before, of the double funding issue, and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this. I'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute, because she's much more up to date with the discussions about that, but, so far, I don't think very much progress has been made on that. But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector, and I'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip, who is responsible for the voluntary sector, because obviously many of the groups that we're talking about would come under the voluntary sector, because they have voluntary committees, but they fall between many stools, because they rent premises rather than own premises and they don't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants. So, perhaps I could ask Nicola to come in to expand on that.\nNicola Edwards:Absolutely.\nLynne Neagle AM:Briefly, if possible.\nNicola Edwards:I'll try and be brief, because I'm conscious of time. So, some childcare settings can access funding under the small business rate relief scheme, but certainly not all of them; some of them can access funding under the economic resilience fund, and, as the Deputy Minister said, we're following up for some of them to be able to access funding under the third sector resilience funding. All of the childcare settings can apply for the UK Government's coronavirus job retention scheme, but there are some complications around that in that it's a salary-based scheme and you can't claim two types of public funding for the same individual member of staff. So, if you were using funding under the childcare offer to pay for a particular member of staff's salary, you can't access CJRS and furlough that individual with Government money as well, and that has led to some confusion and complication about how that balances, which we're trying to work through with the sector and with local authorities around the rules and regulations that the Treasury and HMRC have put in place around that. Alongside that, there's a whole range of different loans and services that are available. Some of those are less attractive to some childcare settings, but they are still available and Business Wales is offering support and advice for settings on how they can help weather this storm and support their workers as best they can. We're also having some conversations now with our economy colleagues and with Business Wales about what happens next, the recovery and the return of the sector, and we've just come out of a meeting with the childcare sector around the support they think they would need to have in place to be able to return from this as well. So, it's a topic that's very much live at the moment.\nSian Gwenllian AM:I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM:Well, that is what we're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Siân, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM:I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so—. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards:I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM:Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM:Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards:Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM:Well, that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM:Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM:Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM:Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n", "summary": "The meeting was about caring Welsh children during the outbreak of COVID-19. Due to the coronavirus, the state was locked down and a strict social distance was required, and then most schools in Welsh were shut down. The group was concerned whether the existing support was enough to ensure their children get through such a period healthily, in terms of both mentally and physically. They listed several possible solutions, including having the vaccination on the susceptible group, offering psychological support for the children as well as the pregnant women, and raising a contingency fund. Through their asking and answering with the ministers, the group finally agreed on a bright blueprint for the education and economic recovery in Welsh.", "length": 14523}

It's a cat . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No it looks great .\nIndustrial Designer:Miaow .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well if this isn't obvious {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well well um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Just save it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah save it {vocalsound} and {vocalsound} start a new blank document .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I'll save it {vocalsound} alright uh save . Uh yeah uh blank .\nProject Manager:Yep . So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it .\nIndustrial Designer:Well I feel comfortable now .\nMarketing:Oh great .\nProject Manager:Well {vocalsound} it's terrific , eh ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Thanks for this exercise . I feel totally at ease .\nMarketing:It's good for group spirit . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah that's it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It certainly is . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We're one big happy family now . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah something like that .\nProject Manager:Well then uh the serious uh stuff . We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first {gap} about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ?\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker} Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? Please ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nProject Manager:No uh I did . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah .\nMarketing:On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce .\nProject Manager:Yep . That's alright .\nMarketing:Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player\nProject Manager:That would be a nice idea , yes .\nMarketing:so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control .\nProject Manager:Yep yep yep .\nMarketing:Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to {gap} well fifty million ?\nProject Manager:Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so a lot of people have to be able to use it .\nIndustrial Designer:No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Easy to learn .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah that's right .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh {disfmarker} well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I also think we should not add too many buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:No that's right .\nUser Interface:Modern day uh remotes have {vocalsound} too much buttons I think .\nProject Manager:Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's {gap}\nUser Interface:Precisely .\nProject Manager:culture uh international .\nMarketing:Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah indeed .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah right .\nProject Manager:Yep , and maybe we do uh {vocalsound} we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou\nUser Interface:Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ?\nProject Manager:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:And stereo uh s uh audio installations .\nProject Manager:We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw .\nMarketing:Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind .\nIndustrial Designer:Most people do , yeah .\nProject Manager:Well yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It doesn't {gap}\nProject Manager:It doesn't have to be , but we can .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:it doesn't have to be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it .\nProject Manager:Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ .\nMarketing:Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah alright , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah because we look at competitors\nIndustrial Designer:Well .\nProject Manager:and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah but it's {disfmarker} it has to be useable .\nIndustrial Designer:It has to be different and familiar at the same time .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing {gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you can make it uh triangle shaped ,\nUser Interface:Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but that's not uh very recognisable .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager:Oo\nIndustrial Designer:Oval ?\nProject Manager:N we can use uh it as a as a game pad .\nUser Interface:Yeah or so\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So {vocalsound} one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well yeah it's new . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} . Not with two hands . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah , right .\nUser Interface:{gap} but young people want something different\nMarketing:No {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and it is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well i we already uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah but it's quite important that it fits .\nProject Manager:one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh but it ha it has to be m\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to {disfmarker} we can imagine uh\nUser Interface:Yeah alright .\nProject Manager:because it's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have {vocalsound} been uh tested out so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful\nProject Manager:Yes . Well {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:or else uh they would have been ano another shape .\nProject Manager:for me personally I have a {vocalsound} a lot of remotes uh at home but {vocalsound} those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle {vocalsound} I don't like to use them . I have uh have to {disfmarker} it has to fit my hands .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:When it falls over it and I just have {disfmarker} and then the button that I use most has to be here .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah\nMarketing:It shouldn't be boxy .\nIndustrial Designer:a lo {gap} the long box shape yeah . You have to {vocalsound} use one hand .\nProject Manager:It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with {gap} thumb .\nMarketing:Nah {disfmarker} I don't agree with the long box uh shape {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Why not ?\nMarketing:it it has to be custom made for the hand .\nUser Interface:Yeah it doesn't fit {gap} .\nProject Manager:Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape ,\nMarketing:Yeah but if you shape it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but then you have {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ {gap} with their uh remotes {vocalsound} pl players {vocalsound} they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped .\nMarketing:If {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:D_V_D_ players . Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:W no w what else ?\nMarketing:No that's ol old fashioned .\nIndustrial Designer:I di\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ?\nUser Interface:Yes uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I can imagine that us\nUser Interface:Well {vocalsound} most of {gap} of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end .\nMarketing:Yeah right . It fits in your palms .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Well {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh {vocalsound} round forms in it to fit your hand ,\nUser Interface:Yeah it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Hmm ?\nProject Manager:A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand .\nMarketing:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:but it's it's still {disfmarker} Yeah yeah al alright\nProject Manager:That's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but but it's still it's still {gap} sort of box , yeah .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah yea\nIndustrial Designer:It it has round forms\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean .\nMarketing:Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah I understand , but {disfmarker} no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square\nMarketing:It shouldn't be too boxy , you know .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:It's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No no no .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but a also with round edges of course ,\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:but in in in at the end it's still this long {vocalsound} box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh {vocalsound} to fit .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Right maybe something like this\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yes {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} and then a button here to switch between {vocalsound} different systems like D_V_D_ player\nIndustrial Designer:I thought about something like that . Yeah .\nMarketing:and so you can {disfmarker} I've {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:A big recognisable button on top or something .\nMarketing:Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We have five minutes left .\nIndustrial Designer:The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course ,\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes\nIndustrial Designer:and uh n uh uh not too close uh together .\nProject Manager:uh that's {vocalsound} yep .\nMarketing:But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:So there has to be some space between the buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah right right ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:and maybe we should use colours .\nUser Interface:Yeah {gap} maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well {gap} {vocalsound} you can you can put on on them ,\nIndustrial Designer:Colours , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Ha .\nUser Interface:and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs {vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's kinda trendy . Yeah right .\nProject Manager:Sound nice . Yes .\nUser Interface:I dunno but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well it's just uh about our first ideas now\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nProject Manager:so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Right . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes ?\nIndustrial Designer:Already thought about something tha {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:so we {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well thirty minutes we have . So um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No problem .\nProject Manager:Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah now we can still talk about the material ,\nProject Manager:Yeah yes say .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:we have some some minutes left uh {gap} I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:No n n\nProject Manager:and when I've had use it much it was gone . So it has to be made in the buttons I think .\nUser Interface:Yeah that's bad , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:It has to uh not be loose .\nUser Interface:Yeah that's important {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Alright . And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh {vocalsound} to connect things uh to each other .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think so .\nMarketing:Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a a common stan standard way {gap}\nProject Manager:It's not that in China it's different ?\nMarketing:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:infrared beams an infrared beam I think {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And you can use {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Probably yes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:China rules . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And have {disfmarker} well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . {vocalsound} The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But are {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but that's pretty obvious , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ?\nProject Manager:Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes .\nMarketing:I think {vocalsound} we should make it universal\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it {vocalsound} just plain\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nMarketing:but you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} To make it more trendy .\nProject Manager:Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Yes . Yes .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well you can make profit with them , and it's {vocalsound} a way to make them trendy .\nProject Manager:Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself {vocalsound} so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something\nUser Interface:Yeah alright {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah right .\nUser Interface:Yeah normal .\nIndustrial Designer:uh b a simple colour not not very flashy .\nProject Manager:Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell ,\nUser Interface:No a colour everyone accepts .\nProject Manager:so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Pink television sets {vocalsound} pink remote , {gap} .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {gap} standard .\nMarketing:But people of often don't like bright colours or something .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nMarketing:We have to make it grey or s or black .\nUser Interface:Well young people s li\nMarketing:Yeah but then you can use {vocalsound} a a front .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I must not forget my pen the next time . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well if if you {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . I think .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah that's right .\nProject Manager:But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah or a t Teletubby front . {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate .\nProject Manager:Yes . {vocalsound} Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh {gap} I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah .\nProject Manager:Or something like that . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I uh w was wondering that too .\nProject Manager:Euro ?\nIndustrial Designer:Y you went to the company website {gap} .\nMarketing:It's {disfmarker} Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well it it it's {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:if you uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's the the the start uh starting page uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it {gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Finish meeting now . Oh alright . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Well that's great .\nUser Interface:Next meeting is in {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:In thirty minutes , but uh I think it will be {disfmarker} you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here .\nUser Interface:Thirty minutes .\nMarketing:Thirty minutes .\nUser Interface:Yeah alright it's it's handy to know {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Very handy to know .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's totally broken . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:because uh {vocalsound} it's it's the half of the normal size . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Right see you in half an hour then .\nProject Manager:Oh right , oh .\nUser Interface:Oh . {vocalsound} Goodbye . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Ma {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:W\nMarketing:Oh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:S\nProject Manager:W {vocalsound} that was a nice meeting .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Right uh see you in thirty minutes then . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , see you . {vocalsound}\n", "summary": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project. They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential.

{"id": 21, "conversations": "Project Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah , pinball .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Not doing .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm . Ah . Hey . {vocalsound} Ah .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:Now I have my screen back too . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Very good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} we have presentations . So first , it's your turn .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nUser Interface:Mine . Oh , great .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Isn't it amazing . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Huh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Very interesting .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Industrial Designer . Interface concept .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Large .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .\nMarketing:A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons .\nUser Interface:Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh {disfmarker} Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker} Yeah . So , that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .\nUser Interface:Uh , well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .\nProject Manager:Okay . But {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So , uh how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You have to put it on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Like this .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:Yes .\nUser Interface:Uh , so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Not too much colours .\nUser Interface:Uh , no . Not too much .\nProject Manager:No , it's not flower power .\nUser Interface:But uh {disfmarker} No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:S okay .\nUser Interface:Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:That was that .\nProject Manager:Thank you . So , you're next .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm next , okay . {vocalsound} Yes . No . Here we go .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\nMarketing:{gap} Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you {disfmarker} it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice {gap} have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh {gap} it won't have to burst uh like in the {disfmarker} in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:uh if you {gap} push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the {disfmarker} for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . You have any more questions about this ? I think the main thing is we look at the costs .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .\nMarketing:Yeah . But , thi i uh {disfmarker} This is with an L_C_D_ ? No ,\nIndustrial Designer:Not with an L_C_D_ .\nMarketing:not .\nProject Manager:No , isn't .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nProject Manager:But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher .\nProject Manager:But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . If you don't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Th then you'll see it on the television .\nProject Manager:Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . When you scroll .\nIndustrial Designer:but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah\nProject Manager:but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . Yeah So you may not be uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No . The television must do that . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . And mostly they are smaller . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . But that won't be a problem . I think .\nProject Manager:Most the times that are not advanced televisions .\nIndustrial Designer:No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:'Cause it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's important .\nMarketing:I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better .\nIndustrial Designer:That's true .\nMarketing:And that might uh bring back the costs uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But then we'll {disfmarker} I think we must discuss who {disfmarker} uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:I can uh look on my uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's very important .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Uh {disfmarker} Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .\nProject Manager:Yeah , more expensive . But how much ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Doesn't say . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:Huh .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:That's from my manufacturing division .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:'Kay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well , thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes ?\nMarketing:My turn ?\nProject Manager:Next .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm . So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . {vocalsound} 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend {disfmarker} uh trends . And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel {disfmarker} have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:To get a feeling for this . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's {disfmarker} it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be {disfmarker} uh can be totally different . And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind .\nIndustrial Designer:Changing covers . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer:Nope .\nProject Manager:No . It's clear .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:So now , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Ah , let's see . Now , w we have to decide {vocalsound} Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at {disfmarker} 'S next . Components and user interface concept . So {disfmarker} Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . First , uh user interface .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , uh-uh . How w how we how we make it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes , a concept on uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but if I paint with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I'll paint . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Something like this ? Or {disfmarker} Shapes or {disfmarker} What do we need ?\nUser Interface:Mm , yes . What ?\nMarketing:Can make several uh concepts .\nProject Manager:Yes , okay .\nMarketing:We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:More like something {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah I I I uh {disfmarker} yes . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:M like {disfmarker} Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it .\nProject Manager:And you have to .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I have to .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not a designer . It's more {gap} three D_ . Like , um when you have a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's like a gun . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:A g {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , it has to be soft ?\nMarketing:Mm . {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:And it has to be soft , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . And uh , the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer:So , you can squeeze in it and {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nProject Manager:Buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Buttons on top of it . And here . The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No , it won't .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ?\nIndustrial Designer:But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .\nUser Interface:But but how {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And the b\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . How {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ? Or two buttons .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Uh , two scroll uh wheels .\nMarketing:And i if we go to uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:If uh {disfmarker} 'Kay c If we do {disfmarker} If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's th that's more difficult .\nMarketing:But if we have uh a me Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's better in {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?\nIndustrial Designer:with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Because uh , from h hundred uh {gap} remote controls , ninety nine have it .\nProject Manager:But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu .\nMarketing:Uh-uh .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but {vocalsound} again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You don't know . So , there's no menu .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know . It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No . So you can't use it .\nIndustrial Designer:And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .\nProject Manager:Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . But you all like this kind of thing . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Good concept . But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:With the scroll button .\nProject Manager:That's one .\nIndustrial Designer:And and this one has to be soft .\nMarketing:Uh-uh .\nIndustrial Designer:And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It's one . Two . Number two .\nUser Interface:And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Like uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ah that's nice .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Here . Trigger . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No . {vocalsound} But when you handle it , you put it on and off .\nUser Interface:Just to uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's not good to use .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah , but {vocalsound} I'll zap .\nUser Interface:Oh , like a {vocalsound} {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Fuck . Out . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , it's not good .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . Then uh {disfmarker} Paint it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Paint it ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:With the scroll thing on , like this ?\nProject Manager:One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah . Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu .\nIndustrial Designer:So ?\nProject Manager:And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Draw it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Unbelievable .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Not so difficult .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:But if you put {disfmarker} push the the menu button {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh , that's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface:Yeah , wh what {disfmarker} Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .\nProject Manager:You have to {disfmarker} For the menu .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . One that way . And one that way . So {disfmarker} Then it depends on the cost . S On and off .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:When it's not too big . Just like a a phone .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um\nIndustrial Designer:Separate , more separate , h yeah .\nMarketing:more separate , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yes , okay .\nMarketing:Like , you have the menu button in between uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have a big uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Very good . Is it better ? When you uh {gap} the menu , you have to go there there there there .\nIndustrial Designer:I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:They were like round curves , uh different uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . But now the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , okay , okay .\nProject Manager:First the buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um {disfmarker} The mute button .\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nMarketing:We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the {disfmarker} to to uh {disfmarker} have to uh {disfmarker} numbers\nProject Manager:Mute . And the other .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Not so difficult .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} But , uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .\nProject Manager:But how do you wanna solve it ?\nIndustrial Designer:With the switch button .\nProject Manager:Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .\nIndustrial Designer:No\nProject Manager:Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down .\nIndustrial Designer:like uh {disfmarker} Oh , you mean like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , then you can also have like uh th um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:A joystick .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and joystick , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But is it uh {disfmarker} Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi\nProject Manager:Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh . Why do I pay you for ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , well {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Better ideas . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And {disfmarker} {gap} No , no . It won't work .\nProject Manager:For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} Think we have to keep them .\nIndustrial Designer:Or a remote control more like joystick .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but is it {disfmarker} That's not expensive than uh {disfmarker} Joystick is better . A small one .\nIndustrial Designer:A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k\nProject Manager:No just like in a\nIndustrial Designer:Playstation thing .\nProject Manager:a laptop . Small , round .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Then it's not so big .\nIndustrial Designer:No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control .\nProject Manager:Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Just like a Playstation thing . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} Maybe , if it's possible , {vocalsound} it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:A small one . So , please look at it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No , that's okay , I got {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they're not uh in details .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah we {disfmarker} I think you get it . So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} Then I have to come with it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs .\nProject Manager:Your problem . Not mine .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Then I'll uh make something up .\nProject Manager:Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Then it's {disfmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .\nUser Interface:Mm , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery .\nProject Manager:No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So we use a normal battery .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Depends on the scroll .\nProject Manager:Scroll .\nIndustrial Designer:If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\nIndustrial Designer:Uh the most expensive .\nProject Manager:Yes , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll .\nIndustrial Designer:If we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:If we {disfmarker} No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .\nProject Manager:Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} But , it has to be small . I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?\nProject Manager:If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y {vocalsound} Yeah but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Just use your thumb .\nProject Manager:If you use a phone .\nIndustrial Designer:If you {disfmarker} Yeah . I use my thumb .\nProject Manager:{gap} k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nIndustrial Designer:If you have a joystick on {disfmarker} No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh {vocalsound} straight .\nProject Manager:No . No , no .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but then you look forward .\nMarketing:Uh , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And then you can y\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nProject Manager:N well , if you have to look at it .\nMarketing:If you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . Here's our designer .\nMarketing:If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Then it goes like this .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , why not .\nProject Manager:If th n well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's for the younger people .\nProject Manager:Yes , of course .\nIndustrial Designer:It's something new . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's good good .\nUser Interface:It's uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But the {disfmarker} um , it may not break .\nIndustrial Designer:Now we put uh rubber around it .\nProject Manager:Okay . If that's possible .\nMarketing:Um , Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Or you can uh turn it inside .\nMarketing:{gap} I can't see the {gap} . But , uh the easy of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh .\nUser Interface:No , that's true .\nMarketing:Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah of course .\nIndustrial Designer:This is something new .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So ,\nIndustrial Designer:Costs are okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} um we have one minute .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} One .\nProject Manager:I think . No .\nMarketing:No . You have more .\nProject Manager:More . Seven .\nMarketing:You have still ten .\nProject Manager:Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , that's us together .\nProject Manager:You two stay here . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Paint it .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Now you have to .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I think it's clear . Check your mail . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:It has to be ready in the next meeting . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Cookie .\nMarketing:What ? Okay .\nProject Manager:Next meeting is called the detailed design . So {disfmarker} Everyth everything has to be ready . Thanks for your attention . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nMarketing:See you at the next meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Bye bye .\n", "summary": "Firstly, User Interface suggested trendy and one-color cases, good icons on the big buttons since they would be recognizable and excite the young people. Secondly, Industrial Designer introduced that young people favored soft materials and primary colors, but trendy design on the button and the use of LCD display would increase cost since the budget had always been a big problem. Moreover, the team would aim at the younger market based on the decision of the former meeting and agreed that to make the device more profitable they should sell the product for longer than one year. The team also discussed the button function of the remote control but they had not come to an agreement.

{"id": 22, "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. We've also received apologies from Dawn Bowden. Can I also welcome Siân Gwenllian to the meeting? Siân is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. Can I ask Members if they've got any declarations of interest, please? Hefin.\nHefin David AM:Apologies. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you very much. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns.\nAngela Burns AM:Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?\nDr David Blaney:Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between—. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well.\nAngela Burns AM:Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves looking like at present?\nDr David Blaney:Here, I refer to my learned friend.\nBethan Owen:The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves—I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM:I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students—it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before.\nBethan Owen:We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have.\nAngela Burns AM:Yes, I do understand the difference.\nBethan Owen:And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that.\nAngela Burns AM:So, overall, you're painting a picture of a sector that's under a significant degree of financial stress, and this is obviously using your key financial indicators. Do you monitor each and every university, or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is?\nBethan Owen:We monitor, we receive forecasts, five-year forecasts, and we meet frequently with all our universities now. It varies, depending on the risks of the universities, as to how frequently we meet, but we're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July, the changes, even in the 12-month period, are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is. The forecasts, if I just run through—. We had a sector that, in 2017-18, had a deficit. Although it had a turnover and income of £1.5 billion, which had increased, nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18, which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent, but notably, again, the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs, and there have been significant changes in pension costs, both for the teachers' pension scheme and the universities' superannuation scheme as well, and those will be significant costs that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income, certainly their fee income, is not increasing, and that is the challenge.\nAngela Burns AM:Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years?\nDr David Blaney:I don't think so. As I said earlier on, we're not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. At the moment, our sense is they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly, and we are seeing that at the moment. So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out, so more jobs being lost, more capacity being lost, but that's not the same as falling over. I don't see people falling over. There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector, and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about, but it's not a policy position, and it's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway, actually. But I think, as I say, we're in a managed situation, but the challenges are quite acute. But I don't see an institution falling over in the foreseeable future.\nAngela Burns AM:When you talk about structural change, are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close? I bring this up because I'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and I have had multiple representations from students, and their parents, who are about to go to Lampeter and who've been told that courses are being restructured, there's a massive staff loss, and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained. So I am trying to drill down a little bit, because I think it's only fair for the students to know what they're up against, and also it's a bit like in the great depression—you can start a run on something, can't you? Because if enough people believe it, then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university, really top-quality in medieval literature, in archaeology. And I'm just talking about one, but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales, so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes.\nDr David Blaney:So, there's quite a lot in that question, actually. Let me try not to forget any of the elements. First of all, your comment about causing a run is a serious consideration. So, if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week, from my reading of the transcript, it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making. There was reference to the national student survey scores, and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student, because you are looked after properly in Wales. But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there's a crisis, and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media, the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it didn't. At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students, it's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation. So we do need to make sure, I think, all of us, that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it, and that is very harsh. I'm not being critical of the political process here, but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we don't start a run on this. In terms of the specifics at Lampeter, we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments, and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students. That is just not what institutions do. So there's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments, and that's a contractual obligation anyway, so it's a legal obligation. But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study. So they're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they're not planning to continue—they just are not going to do that. And if you think about it in a market context, it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that.\nAngela Burns AM:But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David's financial plans.\nDr David Blaney:Yes, I understand that, so let’s come back to the material uncertainty. [Interruption.] No, I understand, and that's fine. What I'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students. They will look after their students and if they're recruiting to programmes, they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run, and run through to completion. And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that—when they are engaged in portfolio change, they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have. In terms of our oversight and monitoring, our primary consideration, again, is the interest of the students. They are the people who have, in many ways, least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed. Although, they do have a voice and, actually, the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are, again, better than elsewhere in the UK. But, nonetheless, we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing. And so that is our primary consideration when we're looking at these institutions. Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis. So, we have machinery, which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year, to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they're facing. So, it's not the challenges you face, it's the way you face your challenges—it's a cliché—and, at the moment, they are managing them, but if we were in any way concerned that they weren't, the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited, and we do intervene when we have to.\nAngela Burns AM:Well, following on from what you said, I've just got two really specific technical questions, then, to ask, because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on. So, considering how much is invested in their estates, are you happy that each university's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place?\nDr David Blaney:Yes, so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution, so there is proper governance oversight. And in all of those instances, there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates. So, the machinery is in place—\nAngela Burns AM:Because it's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing, isn't it?\nDr David Blaney:Indeed, it is.\nAngela Burns AM:So, if our universities are on a sticky wicket, we just need to know that the borrowing that they're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate. So, as long as you're content, if I can hear you say that—[Laughter.]\nDr David Blaney:Okay. We're content on two fronts: one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that, but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing, they have to get our consent as well. And what we don't do is second-guess everything, but what we do do is make sure that the governing body, or its relevant committees, have been asking the right questions. So, there are two bits to this.\nAngela Burns AM:And then—sorry.\nBethan Owen:Can I just add to that, then?\nAngela Burns AM:Yes, of course.\nBethan Owen:In asking for the forecasts, we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios. So, to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past, where there's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast, we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided—not just the governing body—with the scenario where there is no growth in the income. That's not the core forecast, but a scenario, so that it's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth, and if that growth doesn't come through, what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met. And we should probably just differentiate between—we have a role before borrowings are entered into, but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict, certainly what's happened in the last two years, probably, in universities. So, there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings, because that's essential for maintaining their liquidity.\nAngela Burns AM:Which actually, neatly, thank you, brings me to my last question, which is: have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them, unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due?\nBethan Owen:There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015, financial reporting standard 102, so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants, but it was because the accounts were looking very different. The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements, largely student accommodation arrangements, and pension costs, significantly, were recognised in the accounts. So, most universities have had to renegotiate covenants, but we're not aware of any who've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches, other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements—that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements, which they have done earlier this year, and they have now negotiated new covenants. It's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us. Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control. So, again, from that perspective, we have the covenants built into our forecasts, we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants. The nature of those covenants vary, but most of them require a measure of cash flow, a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt, so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system, as well as our ongoing monitoring as well.\nAngela Burns AM:Thank you, Bethan.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Just before we move on to Hefin David, can I just ask you what your view, then, is on the statement included by auditors in the accounts of Trinity Saint David that there is material uncertainty?\nBethan Owen:Yes, I'll pick up on that. The material uncertainty largely relates—there is a note in the accounts that explains the factors that are being taken into account, but it largely relates to some significant cash receipts that have been subject to timing delays and the fact that the timing of these is essentially outside the control of the institution. The main delay relates to the receipt of funding for the Egin project, which was due to be received from the Swansea city deal. That funding has been delayed, but the sums due to the university are still due to the university—it's the issue of the timing of those receipts that is causing a cash pressure. Receipt of that funding would certainly reduce the cash flow pressure at the university at the moment. Just in terms of cash flows, all universities have to ensure that they are maintaining enough cash in their system to meet their payments as they fall due. Most of their costs are incurred on a monthly basis, staff costs in particular, but the income flows into universities are now less regular. In days gone by, that funding would largely flow from us and that would also come on a monthly basis. The funding from the Student Loans Company now, for example, comes in chunks. A quarter of that money comes in in October, a quarter in February, and the majority of it, half of it, doesn't come into the university in cash until May. So, that's quite a different cash management scenario for universities to manage; it requires holding cash balances to do it.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Just before I bring Hefin in, we're going to need to have a bit of agility, as Dai Lloyd would call it, in our questioning and our answers if we're going to cover the ground that we need to cover. So, Hefin.\nHefin David AM:How can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent?\nDr David Blaney:So, the first point to make, of course, is that universities are autonomous, as you know—\nHefin David AM:I've just written 'independent and autonomous'.\nDr David Blaney:Yes, all of that. And they are charities and so on, so they have expectations in respect of that in any case. The university governing body obviously is an important part of the machinery, particularly in terms of generating constructive challenge for the executive within universities. The governing bodies all are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs, the CUC guide, which identifies good practice. So, it’s a higher education code of governance and all Welsh universities work to that code. That code is itself up for review at the moment. So, that is an opportunity for that to be strengthened. Just in terms of governing bodies, it's also important that governing bodies engage in a process of continual refreshing, because that gives you a greater variety of perspectives, which is important. But it’s also important they have people who understand the higher education business as well as from other contexts. Getting that mix right is important. As it happens at the moment, there are also issues about ethnicity and gender balance. Half the chairs of Welsh university governing bodies are female. Half the vice-chancellors are female. That’s a positive position for Wales to be in. But I think our view would be that when you get an increase in the contextual pressures that we’ve been discussing already this morning, the role of the governing body actually becomes even more significant. So, we have encouraged the sector, both the chairmen of the university councils, but also the vice-chancellors, to engage in a process of an independent review of governance in Wales. We’ll be alongside that. We’ll be supporting that. But, actually, it’s important that they own it. And it hasn’t been hard for us to encourage that—they have been keen to take this opportunity to take stock. The Welsh higher education system is part of a UK system—they don’t want to be a million miles away from the rest of the UK in terms of expectations, but there is scope in Wales, given the scale of the sector, to actually construct something that is more challenging, I think, in terms of expectations, than might be the common denominator across the UK, and maybe some more exemplification. Importantly, in this exercise, we are not just interested in governance process. It’s going to be quite hard to do this, but I’m very keen that we engage—and the sector are up for this—in governance culture, because, actually, you can do process checks and you’ll have the right structure of committees and have the right sort of papers going, but, in the end, it’s the dynamic within that room and who’s asking which questions and how well informed they are, and whether it's an open culture or is it a defensive culture—these are really what influences the quality of decision making.\nHefin David AM:And how different are those cultures across institutions?\nDr David Blaney:I think it’s very hard to say. We don’t sit in the governing bodies of those institutions. Very occasionally we get to observe one. Typically, that’s at a point where there are sufficient difficulties going on that we feel that we need to—\nHefin David AM:Do you have the option to observe at any point?\nDr David Blaney:We can't insist, I don't think.\nBethan Owen:We can ask to.\nDr David Blaney:We can ask. But in the main, actually, our presence would change the dynamic of that anyway, so I'm not sure that's necessarily helpful. But we are keen to see what we can achieve with the sector in addressing these issues of what constitutes constructive challenge.\nHefin David AM:I take from that that there might be different approaches in different institutions. Is your aim to see consistency in the same approaches, then?\nDr David Blaney:I think we’d like to see a consistent minimum set of expectations. I think there are differences, because there are people involved. In the end, it’s about personalities, it’s about people’s background and it’s about their knowledge. And we have a role to play in this as well, so we have a toolkit that we produce for governors, which, essentially, is a set of information that locates their university in the context of the UK, across a number of factors. So, if they had been told something that is not perhaps as true as it might be by the executive, they can see that in the data. Whether that toolkit needs a refresh—I’m sure it probably does, it’s been there for a while now—. So, part of that is what information we can provide to help governing bodies be properly informed as well.\nHefin David AM:Yes, and this is the independence and autonomy thing. This is quite distant from Government—unlike other institutions, where you can prescribe some of these approaches.\nDr David Blaney:Yes, and in the end I don't think there's any pushback from the sector in terms of wanting to operate in accordance with best practice.\nHefin David AM:Yes, and I totally defend independence and autonomy.\nDr David Blaney:Absolutely. The challenge is all of us being clear what constitutes best practice.\nHefin David AM:So, what about risk appetite? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite?\nDr David Blaney:I don't think so, and this manifests itself in two ways. So, we would see this coming through in forecasts, and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings, predominantly. Actually, we'd see it in other ways as well. Our links into institutions are many and various, and we have our formal stuff, but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we—. One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they can't hope to in England. It's just completely different. And so we would see it in other ways. But we have, in some instances, I think it's fair to say, helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations. So, where we've seen things and we think, 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic,' we've just asked the questions. We don't say, 'No, you can't do that,' because they are autonomous, they make the decisions, but we try to make sure that they're asking the right questions.\nHefin David AM:So, would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves, in that, where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence, are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge? Or the fact you've just said that, does that suggest to us that, actually, they are falling short?\nDr David Blaney:I think there's a mixture of things going on. We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing. So, you have a governing body with a range of perspectives, and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution, and just occasionally it's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things. So, I don't think it's a shortfall as such, but I just think—\nHefin David AM:The kind of honest broker role, kind of.\nDr David Blaney:The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role, and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that. So, we have relationships with the banks; they come and see us every now and again—typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it. Interestingly, for example, when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities, we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days, wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be. So, they are very keenly aware of what we do. So, it's not really a governance failure; it's just that the machinery includes us.\nHefin David AM:Okay, that's important. And one of the things, from a distance—I mean, I've been involved in different ways in an institution, and looking at the institutions from a distance. There are people, as you say, involved, and people always make the difference in different cultures. Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective, and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well? Those executive permanent staff and the governors—is there challenge there?\nDr David Blaney:I would say, in the main, yes. Occasionally, we help the governors to ask the right questions, so occasionally that external perspective we've just discussed is helpful in that regard. Actually, there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies, inevitably—that's not something that's remarkable—and we can feel that as well. We have conversations with both governing bodies and executives.\nHefin David AM:And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well—you know, media reports and—.\nDr David Blaney:Yes, sometimes these things can spill, and the governing bodies also include student representation, staff representation, who are typically union reps, and so, you know, there are all sorts of—. I'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet, but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context. So, sometimes it can spill. And these tensions are not all-out war, but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through, and that's governance working properly, I think.\nHefin David AM:Okay, which is—some of the work you've suggested will help towards that.\nDr David Blaney:Yes.\nHefin David AM:And a last question: you've identified one university as high risk, five as medium, and two as low in the short to medium term. You're obviously not going to tell us which, but what I'm interested in is the direction of travel, and whether those that are 'medium'—are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high' in the near future?\nDr David Blaney:I think it's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales, and it's about the financial pressures that we've already discussed this morning. And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement, and, indeed, other bits of money now and again, are so important. So, she's doing what she can, and that's really good, but we always knew that, between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation, there was going to be a valley to cross. The new machinery costs more as you phase out the old as well. So, the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure; there's a demographic dip, and there are the other contextual factors we've discussed. We always knew there was going to be a valley. And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really don't have to take out, because they don't want to reduce capacity, which they'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves. So, they are seeing deficits, which are managed deficits, where they're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in. So, they're being as responsible as we could expect them to be in this.\nHefin David AM:And, if you're back in a year or two's time, the next few years, are we confident that there won't be more in the high-risk category? You said you don't see collapse, but are we confident there won't be more in the high-risk category?\nDr David Blaney:Well, I think what I would always say about this process is that it doesn't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy. We can only go on what we can see. So, I wouldn't—. HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation, so I'm not going to say we're confident, but that doesn't mean to say we're worried either.\nHefin David AM:Right, okay. So, to answer my question: are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not?\nDr David Blaney:We might.\nHefin David AM:Okay.\nBethan Owen:And, just to add, I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students, because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales, but from England and internationally—so, that's a key part—and also that our research portfolio is invested in, and that also brings economic benefits. So, I think those are the two that we are [correction: need to be] able to maintain: the institutions as attractive options for students, and that our research capacity is invested in.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. I've got a supplementary from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Just in the interest of transparency, are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk?\nDr David Blaney:We don't publish that; we publish numbers. So, that's, I'm afraid, where we're going to stick.\nHefin David AM:They didn't even try to—[Inaudible.] [Laughter.]\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Thank you. The next questions then are from Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Good morning. Can you explain your overall approach to the 2019-20 allocations and what your priority for allocations has been?\nBethan Owen:We publish our funding allocations, and we published the 2019-20 allocations on 4 June. For 2019-20, we're allocating £149 million, and, as David said, this is the first year that we've been able to start putting funding, additional funding, in from the Diamond recommendations for investment in the sector. So, that means we've been able to increase our recurrent teaching funding by £7 million—not a significant amount, but it's a start. And we have maintained QR, which is our funding for research, quality research, and postgraduate research, at least at the same levels of £76 million, as it's been that in previous years. We've increased part-time funding by £1 million to £26 million, and we've started to increase support for expensive subjects—that's medicine, dentistry and conservatoire provision—and higher cost subjects—those are the sciences and the STEM. So, we made a start on that and increased that support by about £6 million to £20 million in total. And, in addition to that, we have strategic funding that we're maintaining for Reaching Wider projects and the Sêr Cymru project. And then, in addition to our recurrent funding, we have had strategic funding in our remit letters for the last two years. So, we're developing programmes for civic mission, community engagement, collaborations between higher education and further education, and, more recently, we had funding at the end of March to start to implement the recommendations of Graeme Reid's report for research investment, and also for developing mental health and well-being. That strategic funding is very welcome, but to be able to build those activities into our core funding, which we hope Diamond will bring, would be more sustainable for institutions.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. Now, the Minister talks of one skills system. How do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between HE and FE?\nDr David Blaney:So, there are probably two dimensions to this. First of all, we have provided £3.5 million of separate funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between HE and FE. So, we put out a circular inviting proposals for that, and it was competitive, so we funded what was the best of the proposals, and we constrained it to be available only to pump-prime new activity or to add value to existing activity, but not just to keep things ticking over. We had seven bids submitted from across the three Welsh regions on a whole range of activities, which we probably haven't got time to go into now. I've got a long list here, but, for example, in south-east Wales, the University of South Wales is leading on a bid partnering with Cardiff University, Cardiff Met, with the Open University and all the FE players in the region. So, we were really pleased, actually. We tried to get it within regions, because that's how you get the biggest impact for learners in the area and also for smaller enterprises in terms of innovation work. So, that is a specific bit of funding designed to incentivise HE-FE collaboration. And then we direct fund a couple of FE institutions for delivery of higher education for historical reasons, and we also have our funding going through to support franchise activity between HE and FE. There are about 5,000 students who are studying HE programmes under franchise in FE colleges in Wales, and our funding method has, historically for some time now, protected that money. So, we try to prevent universities from taking the money out of franchise and onto campus, because we think it's important to try to encourage local provision within particular localities. And, certainly in areas where public transport infrastructure is perhaps not what it might be, for people to move to universities can be quite a disincentive, so—. But we encourage it that way as well.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. Then, finally from me, the council's remit letter for the 2019-20 academic year from the Minister does ask you to consider how you'd increase openness and transparency around the use of fee income. So, what are the issues here, and how will you take this forward?\nBethan Owen:The reporting of the income and expenditure is largely provided, probably more so in narrative form in the accounts and the financial statements and annual reports of institutions. A number of institutions also provide graphs and more easily accessible information to understand the income and expenditure of universities. But we would accept that this information isn't easy to access at the moment. There are examples of good practice across the sector in presenting as simply as possible what the income sources are for universities and how they spend their money. And we're going to be working with the Welsh universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of that information for Welsh institutions. More transparent reporting of income and expenditure, and not just fee income, is actually very important for understanding how income cross-flows work in universities. Some reasonably simplistic analyses can assume that all the student fee just covers the direct costs of academic provision, but there's much more to the student experience than that, so there are costs: there are the infrastructure costs, the student support costs, even the community engagement and all the research activities bring benefits to the teaching and fee provision. So, more transparency of all the universities' income sources and expenditure and a better understanding of the income cross-flows and why you can't look at universities in isolation of student provision and research, you have to look at the whole—so, we'll be working with them to improve that information.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. We're going to go to Hefin David now for some questions on part-time student funding.\nHefin David AM:Part-time student numbers are bucking the trend in Wales, as I understand it, and we are seeing a bigger increase in Wales of part-time numbers than elsewhere in the UK. How is that going to be sustainable within current arrangements?\nBethan Owen:We've allocated £26.5 million in 2019-20 to support part-time provision, and we have been able in 2019-20 to fund some growth. So, there is growth in that funding to allow those institutions and incentivise those institutions who have recruited more students than last year to continue to do so. That came at an overall additional cost of £1.9 million, and, based on what we're hearing from student support, we're expecting to see that requirement increase. So, it's one of the areas where we'll need to look at how we prioritise Diamond funding. And at the moment, our intention—but subject to knowing the quantum of it—is to continue to support and fund growth in part-time provision.\nHefin David AM:So, is it possible—? With the Welsh Government's policy of developing lifelong learning, is it possible that will be ever spread more thinly?\nDr David Blaney:That is the challenge, and there's a piece of work that we have in our sights to look again at part-time and what it is and what the various drivers are. There's a temptation, I think, at times, to see it solely in terms of skills for an economy, and it is important for reskilling and upskilling, but actually, it's important for other things as well. If we see higher education solely in terms of skilling an economy, we've missed an important part of the contribution that higher education makes. But part-time is really quite difficult, because there's part-time that is about upskilling, part time that's about reskilling, there's part-time for social purposes, there's employer-supported part-time, there's student—. So, there's a complexity there.\nHefin David AM:But they are more reactive to rises in fees.\nDr David Blaney:Well, there is a sense that they are more price sensitive, yes, and so the support regime that the Government is putting in place is important, and that probably has made a difference to the numbers of part-timers entering the system this last year. But I think we need to stake stock of what is important about part-time, what the market will deliver, what the market won't deliver, what we should fund and so on. And there's a complexity around all that, as I've indicated, which we need to do a bit of work on with the sector, with the student body as well, just to take some stock of this over the next year or so.\nHefin David AM:Could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students?\nDr David Blaney:My sense is we won't. The Government wishes us to monitor, so we monitor, and that in itself is not straightforward, actually. But your comment about price sensitivity, I think, is really the nub of it. There's a limit to how much a fee increase would be acceptable to the part-time market. So, I think it's kind of self-regulating in that respect. I don't think we'll see massive fee increases; we might see a bit, but we won't see masses, I don't think.\nHefin David AM:Okay.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. We've got some questions now on funding for research and innovation, and also we'd like to talk a bit about a replacement for European Union funds. Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Thank you very much. If I could turn specifically to research, we know, of course, that both the Diamond and Reid reviews called for QR funding to be maintained in real terms, but the allocation is exactly the same for 2019-20 as it has been for the past nine years. Have you carried out any kind of assessment of the impact of this level of research funding on universities and, indeed, on the Welsh economy?\nDr David Blaney:I'm sorry; I missed the beginning of that because I couldn't hear this headset.\nLynne Neagle AM:Siân, could you repeat the question? Sorry. We had a bit of a problem with translation at the beginning.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes, no problem. I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms. But, of course, the sum hasn't actually increased over a period of nine years.\nDr David Blaney:Okay. The reason the sum hasn't increased is because we haven't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system. We would dearly love to increase it. Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding, for a number of reasons. The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base, which is sustained by QR funding. If they go for UK-based competitive research funding, that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix. So, they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research, with the expectation that QR will plug the gap. And we know that, although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive, and really is punching above its weight in many ways—and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework—we know that, actually, it could do so much more, if it just had more scale. So, we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important, and it's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time. It's almost impossible for a body like us, far less the Government, to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from, and QR provides the flexibility for institutions, which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Therefore, you do have concerns that this isn't increasing—you have that concern of a lack of increase in the level of investment. But has any particular assessment been made of the impact of not increasing that funding?\nDr David Blaney:So, there is—. Graeme Reid's report produced an assessment of the correlation between QR funding and capacity to generate funding from other sources, and there's a very close correlation—\nSian Gwenllian AM:Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research, to all intents and purposes?\nDr David Blaney:Not directly. We've relied on the expert assessment of people like Graeme Reid. It's sometimes more effective to have external experts making these points than us or the sector.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research, which is educational research. How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically?\nDr David Blaney:Bethan, did you want to say something on this?\nBethan Owen:I was just going to add that, when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales, compared with the rest of the UK, it's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England, so the figures show that we receive less of the money that's available, which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage, so we're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that's available as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM:So, there's a knock-on to that; that's what you're trying to say. But from the point of view of my question on educational research—?\nDr David Blaney:So, we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues, and we're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales. I won't go into the full detail of it now, but it's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff, Cardiff Met, Trinity Saint David, Aber, Bangor and the University of South Wales. So, it's a collaborative effort, and we have, in the past, also funded WISERD Education, so it's an important research facility and increasingly being used, I'm delighted to say, by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And likewise, in 2019-20, there will be allocations specifically for this.\nDr David Blaney:It's a bit early to say yet. We haven't allocated anything specifically in the main allocations that we've put out. There might be others to come, but we're not yet in a position to say.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. Well, could you provide the remit letter from—[Inaudible.]—do that? You have to do everything in the remit letters.\nDr David Blaney:We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters, as the wording goes. So, we have it in our sights, but we're not yet ready to make announcements.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union. Of course, this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research, and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact. So, what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding?\nDr David Blaney:So, again, the Reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us. And we endorse, just as the Government has endorsed, the recommendations from Reid. The Government has committed in principle to delivering Reid. The challenge is finding the money, and we fully understand that. There has been an additional £6.6 million allocated for research very recently by the Government, which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from Reid. So, that's a start, but that's not sustainable funding, and it's not enough, really, but it is a good and welcome start. Reid was also not just talking about the money, but also talking about the way in which the Welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with UK-wide developments. And in response to that, we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation, which was developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is—. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?\nBethan Owen:One aspect that we do intend to fund—and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid—is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide £15 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some £7 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too.\nBethan Owen:That £15 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI—and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research—that we need more funding to do the same thing there.\nDr David Blaney:And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM:So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom.\nDr David Blaney:Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?\nDr David Blaney:First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now—we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over £28 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer £1,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?\nDr David Blaney:My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning.\nDr David Blaney:Thank you.\nBethan Owen:Thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM:Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July. Are Members content? Thank you.\n", "summary": "The meeting between Children, Young People and Education Committee and the Welsh Government was considered as an evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. To start with, Dr David Blaney introduced three main causes for the financial challenges facing the universities and the financial elements were diverse but were closely monitored by the government. Although the universities were under a significant degree of financial stress, they were able to secure funding for investing in their estates. Moreover, a structural change was also considered but the future plan was unclear. Besides, the government body tried to see a consistent minimum set of expectations of each university and would try to eliminate culture differences across divisions. When it comes to the risk, the government admitted that there would be more names in the high-risk category. Later, the meeting discussed a target at improving and increasing collaboration between HE and FE. In the end, the government assured that there would be no significant increase in funding for part-time students and funding for research and innovation would be consistent with efforts by both the universities themselves and other institutions.", "length": 14553}

Like the uh\nMarketing:Oh like the phones ,\nIndustrial Designer:like the phones and these things we c yeah .\nMarketing:yeah , it could change colours , yeah .\nUser Interface:Cool .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:At least for children like one colour and {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Ch\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Good idea .\nMarketing:Good .\nIndustrial Designer:And it should be really {gap} small and {gap} .\nProject Manager:Small also ? Don't you think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Huh not so big like {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:No uh , not too much buttons or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , not too much buttons and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} whatever {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I dunno if it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Or if we should have a targeted re remote control .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So colour , robustness , easy to use , size ,\nProject Manager:So , I think there's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:yeah , size matters , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Colour , {vocalsound} size , sh\nProject Manager:So you you think it's better if small than bigger .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , not too small , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like {gap} .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , like a palm sized .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Just to hold it .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh maybe we can change the colours that {disfmarker} at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , at least the colour would be different .\nIndustrial Designer:you are to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame {gap} .\nMarketing:I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're {disfmarker} they never find a good button in the right place .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow ,\nProject Manager:Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um {vocalsound} cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I dunno {gap} .\nUser Interface:No ,\nProject Manager:no .\nUser Interface:no screens , it's too complex .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound} Too expensive , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Too expensive for twelve Euro ?\nUser Interface:And n maybe not too expensive ,\nProject Manager:And too expensive .\nUser Interface:well it's not my problem , but well okay .\nMarketing:Ah .\nUser Interface:But no screens on remote controls .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen {vocalsound} which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right ,\nIndustrial Designer:Ye yeah .\nMarketing:so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:if you {disfmarker} if you like .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean it it's like\nMarketing:I don't know if it makes sense , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} it's like two types no ? {vocalsound} people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this\nMarketing:Yeah , for instance , mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm .\nIndustrial Designer:or {disfmarker} so tha your switch on and off should be on\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:So adaptable {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah something {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Adaptable . Alright , good ,\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?\nIndustrial Designer:huh .\nUser Interface:On off ?\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .\nUser Interface:I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nMarketing:Three buttons you mean ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} like three mental states ,\nProject Manager:Three option .\nUser Interface:yeah you know what I mean ,\nMarketing:Ah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:we can just make it uh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um .\nUser Interface:controlled by a brain , huh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that ask you three {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} If it {disfmarker} if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .\nUser Interface:Sh sure , sure .\nMarketing:Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .\nMarketing:Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have {disfmarker} you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You do this ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Uh no .\nUser Interface:I usually just change channels .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Because I'm only using three or four channels but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put {disfmarker} yeah , you can only have one bit .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Dash .\nMarketing:And then back to the one I was before ,\nProject Manager:Also we can be here {disfmarker}\nMarketing:so there's {disfmarker} whichever it was .\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah you can\nProject Manager:yeah , that would be cool .\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Go back button is good .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries .\nUser Interface:I once had it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah , the previous button is {gap} .\nProject Manager:Mm {vocalsound} yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo {vocalsound} previous of the previous . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:History . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Then you can watch what your {disfmarker} ah you could also record your {disfmarker} record your {vocalsound} sequence of actions ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} that becomes more complex ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remote controls .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah , what the {disfmarker} which channels the viewer {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:maybe it's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So I think we have full of idea .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm {vocalsound} work on these ideas and try to make a uh {vocalsound} the ones , {vocalsound} make um {disfmarker} to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . {vocalsound} And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um . {vocalsound} So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .\nMarketing:So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ?\nUser Interface:Market Expert .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Marketing {disfmarker} yeah {vocalsound} {gap} .\nMarketing:Uh that's me .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh , of course {vocalsound} yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound} I'll think of that .\nProject Manager:Mm okay . So .\nMarketing:So ?\nProject Manager:I think that's all .\nMarketing:Meeting's over ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Great .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nMarketing:Thank you .\nProject Manager:See you in thirty minutes .\nUser Interface:Thank you everybody .\n", "summary": "The main points of the discussion are the design goal and price of a new television remote control project.

{"id": 26, "conversations": "User Interface:.. .\nProject Manager:Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface:Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface:I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager:S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager:Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface:Not at this point .\nProject Manager:So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager:I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer:How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager:Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager:Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing:Right , okay .\nProject Manager:p put them in pockets .\nMarketing:Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager:You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing:So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's got no eyes .\nMarketing:Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface:Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?\nMarketing:I am the um {disfmarker} I need my notebook , mm ooh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert {vocalsound} um so like I'm gonna be doing the {disfmarker} apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything {disfmarker} the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:um so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay .\nProject Manager:And more about yourself , you're from ?\nMarketing:Um I'm from Leicester ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:um second year . Um what else do you want to know ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I like sports {vocalsound} um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:um {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But not with rabbits . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:not with rabbits , no no .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:And vets , I like vets as well .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Cool .\nMarketing:Okay ? Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Excellent , to match the rabbit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .\nProject Manager:There's a {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .\nUser Interface:Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . {vocalsound} Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um {vocalsound} familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh , sorry , maybe I should have {disfmarker} shouldn't have said it beforehand but\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:mm {vocalsound} hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's not bad at all .\nProject Manager:Ah it looks like a dog .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yep .\nMarketing:Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} the other legs are on the other side .\nUser Interface:Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh I hope to be loyal to the project\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And where where are you from ?\nUser Interface:I'm from Estonia\nProject Manager:Estonia .\nUser Interface:uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nUser Interface:um so um in the different um {vocalsound} stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for {vocalsound} yeah , designing the technical functions of the um {vocalsound} um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay , that's it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you . Okay {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I'll do some {disfmarker} I'll rub the features\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and let the drawing stay . {vocalsound} 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um {vocalsound} my favourite animal {disfmarker} one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Good luck .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh this is going to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that'll do .\nMarketing:and then just some horns .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so let let me draw the body first .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Big , round body , really skinny legs {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and they've got a long tail\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:and a long face . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's eating .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It looks like Eeyore . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:And there is some grass there .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this is what I like about {vocalsound} cows {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Horns ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:that they just keeps sitting there eating grass ,\nMarketing:draw some horns . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:they do not disturb anybody um\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:they're kind of Buddhist in a way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So yeah , I like cows . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you .\nProject Manager:Excellent .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager:Right , now now it's my turn obviously . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , here's a space .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It looks very very cute .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I like the cow .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:I'm Jen .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I like {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing:Is that a lizard ?\nIndustrial Designer:No way . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Wow .\nProject Manager:It's a gecko .\nIndustrial Designer:Ah okay .\nUser Interface:Ah , a gecko , okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Is there a difference ?\nUser Interface:Is {disfmarker} a ar are they also like lizards or are they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:They're {disfmarker} Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard .\nUser Interface:yeah , they are\nProject Manager:And I I like geckos\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house\nUser Interface:Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?\nProject Manager:I don't like snakes . I come from Australia\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .\nUser Interface:Wonderful .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . So , I've just thought {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If you right click on it you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally {vocalsound} as {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We've got {disfmarker} um we're planning to sell these remote controls for {disfmarker} let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface:Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager:Something something new .\nMarketing:Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nMarketing:You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing:Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer:but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , so\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager:So , no .\nMarketing:maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Excellent .\nMarketing:'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager:Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing:um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface:with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager:because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager:you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager:Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager:Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .\n", "summary": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

{"id": 30, "conversations": "Project Manager:All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um {vocalsound} remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no {disfmarker} we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:it's just gonna be a television remote . {vocalsound} Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . {vocalsound} For reasons that I don't really know . There's {disfmarker} but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh {vocalsound} um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound} Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?\nProject Manager:Oh , right yeah .\nMarketing:Gotta plug you in .\nProject Manager:Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation .\nProject Manager:Brilliant .\nMarketing:Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .\nIndustrial Designer:So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was {disfmarker} since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means .\nProject Manager:'Kay . Fair enough .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nMarketing:Fine .\nIndustrial Designer:which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics\nIndustrial Designer:'cause we were thinking {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white {disfmarker} like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:It needs , yeah .\nProject Manager:you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .\nProject Manager:Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's the end of my presentation .\nMarketing:Cool .\nProject Manager:Great . Thank you very much Nathan . {vocalsound} Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:S plug yourself in here . Mm . {vocalsound} Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Looks like you're in okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting .\nUser Interface:Th\nProject Manager:There you go . Sweet .\nMarketing:There you go .\nUser Interface:Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .\nProject Manager:Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .\nUser Interface:Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um {vocalsound} now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well\nProject Manager:Oh yeah look at that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . So\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:my personal preferences .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh {gap} .\nProject Manager:Great . Thanks for that Ron .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Kay\nMarketing:Does that mean I'm up ?\nProject Manager:yep that's you .\nMarketing:I think so . Okay .\nUser Interface:I can plug you in .\nMarketing:Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . Slide show up and running .\nProject Manager:Give it a little bit .\nMarketing:Or not . Uh . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort {disfmarker} like watching a hundred people {vocalsound} use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . {vocalsound} And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their {disfmarker} the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . {vocalsound} Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . {vocalsound} So it's a good start for us .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um\nMarketing:Need to unplug this ?\nProject Manager:yep I'll just uh switch that back here .\nMarketing:Need it back .\nProject Manager:I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .\nMarketing:There you go .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um {vocalsound} through you guys's presentations um {vocalsound} we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . {vocalsound} Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,\nMarketing:Oh right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics {vocalsound} um . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . So maybe this {disfmarker} we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um ,\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly .\nMarketing:Uh .\nProject Manager:Um so um . How {disfmarker} th this voice operation thing is {disfmarker} I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but we might be able to say um {vocalsound} volume up .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh . That could work . I like that .\nIndustrial Designer:With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep\nMarketing:Yeah . Something very basic .\nIndustrial Designer:and\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer:therefore be found .\nUser Interface:Sounds good .\nMarketing:Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah I think that's very doable .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a good point .\nProject Manager:If it's hidden under the couch {disfmarker} but then again you have this wee {disfmarker} this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .\nUser Interface:A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:And you just say something to {disfmarker} into that\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and it\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:finds your {disfmarker}\nMarketing:K {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker} yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .\nMarketing:True .\nUser Interface:And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k\nMarketing:Making it just an option ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .\nMarketing:Yeah . Right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I was thinking uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Are we still thinking about this screen {disfmarker} sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh go ahead .\nMarketing:Go ahead . The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:'S definitely an option technically . I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not ,\nMarketing:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point .\nMarketing:We're doing okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for .\nIndustrial Designer:Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:True . Worth looking into .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:True . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's just something to consider .\nProject Manager:Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I appear to have lost my microphone . Mm . {vocalsound} Right um we don't have many people {vocalsound} or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . Um right . I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um . The thing with {disfmarker} I see {vocalsound} would there not be a {vocalsound} we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .\nMarketing:Mm . Just the casing .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:We could have the casing , the the face plates .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Back to the uh the cost {disfmarker} the material . {vocalsound} We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That's something I w for {disfmarker} say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:See if there {disfmarker} if there's even interest out there .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .\nProject Manager:Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to {disfmarker} who all\nMarketing:Mm . Right .\nProject Manager:it's not like with cell phones like where you have a {disfmarker} you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:True . True . True .\nUser Interface:and most people have their televisions in the living room . Uh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright well we can {disfmarker} we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um .\nMarketing:Yeah . Oh yeah .\nUser Interface:Sure .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um {vocalsound} yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?\nUser Interface:Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah yeah okay . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Interface ?\nProject Manager:Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally {disfmarker} let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have {disfmarker} Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . {vocalsound} Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .\nMarketing:True . 'Cause it would have a docking base ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years {vocalsound} even with the touch screen ?\nProject Manager:Do they ? Okay .\nUser Interface:Those new ones .\nIndustrial Designer:Can we afford to include one of those ?\nMarketing:Can we afford that ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And will somebody buy it if we don't ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay so let's go with a um touch screen {vocalsound} with um some kind of {disfmarker} you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology {disfmarker}\nMarketing:For twelve Euros ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\nMarketing:It is . Fair enough .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you know so {disfmarker} you know . Well yeah I mean\nMarketing:The basics .\nProject Manager:you can put the {disfmarker} we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay so we'll {gap} touch screen and the battery , focus on um {vocalsound} uh presentation .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nProject Manager:and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while {disfmarker} to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into {disfmarker} go into the next round of individual work on this .\nIndustrial Designer:Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\nUser Interface:Be interesting .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And {gap} oh .\nIndustrial Designer:logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .\nMarketing:Yeah the {vocalsound} the fashion\nUser Interface:We put fashion into electronics .\nMarketing:do . Yeah .\nProject Manager:W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\nMarketing:Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah I think perhaps {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:'S too much .\nProject Manager:good idea but yeah\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think that that one m might just be um and they just {disfmarker} yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular {disfmarker}\nMarketing:For now .\nProject Manager:a P_D_A_ would {disfmarker} they would {disfmarker} makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you guys think ?\nIndustrial Designer:Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .\nMarketing:Yeah . Nice .\nIndustrial Designer:That'd be okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\nMarketing:Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . True .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Y {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Jus\nMarketing:Yeah you would think .\nProject Manager:But apparently not .\nMarketing:But .\nProject Manager:So .\nIndustrial Designer:People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\nMarketing:If it comes from above .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:They just want it to be on and ready to go .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it {disfmarker} the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i\nUser Interface:Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .\nProject Manager:Oh\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .\nUser Interface:Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good .\nMarketing:We're good ?\nProject Manager:I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\nUser Interface:I've put my files in the shared folder as well .\nProject Manager:Brilliant .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's fab guys . Cool .\n", "summary": "The meeting was about a second-stage idea of the new television remote.

Hi ?\nPhD B:Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F:Channel B .\nProfessor A:People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D:Channel four . Test .\nPhD C:Uh - oh .\nPhD D:OK .\nPhD C:Radio four .\nGrad E:Hello ?\nProfessor A:So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D:Today 's\nProfessor A:Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C:Mmm .\nProfessor A:eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B:I was there .\nProfessor A:Oh you were there ?\nPhD B:With Hynek ?\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD B:Yeah .\nProfessor A:So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C:Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD C:Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A:What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C:So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:I forget .\nPhD C:So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A:Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C:Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D:System on\nProfessor A:Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C:Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C:Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A:I see .\nPhD C:I guess .\nProfessor A:Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C:Uh .\nProfessor A:and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C:Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C:We don't have yet\nProfessor A:Oh OK .\nPhD C:um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A:OK .\nPhD C:We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD C:Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A:Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C:Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD C:and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A:Uh - huh .\nPhD C:Um .\nProfessor A:Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C:So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A:OK .\nPhD C:Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A:Right .\nPhD C:yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A:OK .\nPhD C:Yeah ,\nProfessor A:I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C:um .\nProfessor A:cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmarker} and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that {vocalsound} you were sort of waiting for them to {vocalsound} tell you that they had something for you and {disfmarker} and that {disfmarker} and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:and {vocalsound} they were sort of waiting for you and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh we ended up with this thing where they {disfmarker} they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that . So . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean it 's true that maybe {disfmarker} maybe no one really thought about that {disfmarker} that this latency thing would be such a {disfmarker} a strict issue\nPhD C:Yeah . Well , but . Yeah . Yeah . Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker} the other {disfmarker}\nPhD C:Yeah I don't know what happened really , but\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD C:I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's also so uh the time constraints . Because , {vocalsound} well , we discussed about that {disfmarker} about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and\nProfessor A:Then they couldn't . I see .\nPhD C:uh yeah . But there was also problem {disfmarker} perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:Just talk more .\nPhD C:Yeah , slikes and send mails .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD C:u s o o Yeah .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD C:Uh . OK .\nProfessor A:So there 's um {disfmarker} Alright . Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the {disfmarker} all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this {disfmarker} machines are busy and {vocalsound} you 're busy\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor A:and\nPhD C:Basically .\nProfessor A:Yeah . OK . Oh .\nPhD C:Um .\nProfessor A:Let 's {disfmarker} let 's , I mean , I think that as {disfmarker} as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there {disfmarker} there will be {vocalsound} uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that {vocalsound} it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's {vocalsound} approach or something and {vocalsound} in addition to {disfmarker} They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ?\nPhD C:Yeah , yeah . So yeah we 're {disfmarker} will start to do this also .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD C:Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson {disfmarker} Ericsson code .\nPhD D:Yeah . We modif\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD C:And\nPhD D:Yeah , I modified it {disfmarker} well , modifying {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . and we have some {disfmarker} the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D:But we haven't result until this moment .\nProfessor A:Yeah , sure .\nPhD D:But well , we are working in this also\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD D:and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that it 's in process or that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it finished and it didn't get a good result ?\nPhD D:No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature {disfmarker} the feature but the experiment have\nPhD C:Yeah .\nPhD D:we have not make the experiment\nProfessor A:Oh . OK .\nPhD D:and maybe will be good result or bad result , we don't know .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C:Yeah .\nProfessor A:OK . So um I suggest actually now we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sorta move on and {disfmarker} and hear what 's {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening in {disfmarker} in other areas like {vocalsound} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening with your {vocalsound} investigations {vocalsound} about echos and so on .\nGrad F:Oh um Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad F:um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad F:Uh {vocalsound} I also um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} for his code yet . Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and {vocalsound} I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it sounded like um {vocalsound} the channel normalization part {vocalsound} um of his thesis um {vocalsound} was done in a {disfmarker} a bit of I don't know what the word is , a {disfmarker} a bit of a rough way um {vocalsound} it sounded like he um he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was {vocalsound} interesting for the test situation but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it 's {vocalsound} what I 'd wanna use so I have to {disfmarker} I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet .\nProfessor A:OK . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again ,\nPhD D:It 's my\nPhD C:Oh yeah ?\nPhD D:I know this is mine here .\nProfessor A:so . OK . Um . {vocalsound} The um {disfmarker} so you , and then {vocalsound} you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the {disfmarker} the close mounted and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant {disfmarker}\nGrad F:Uh I I 'm ho Right . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or I 'm hoping {disfmarker} I 'm hoping Espen will do it .\nProfessor A:Ah ! OK .\nGrad F:Um\nProfessor A:F um\nGrad F:u\nProfessor A:Delegate . That 's good . It 's good to delegate .\nGrad F:I {disfmarker} I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it .\nProfessor A:Great . Great . Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . Um . {vocalsound} One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner {vocalsound} close - miked recordings . So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close {disfmarker} close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have {vocalsound} um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from {disfmarker} So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be {disfmarker} So {vocalsound} what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but {vocalsound} uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh {vocalsound} uh a uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . So . Um what was it , there was {disfmarker} there was some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some point where {vocalsound} eh uh Eric or somebody was {disfmarker} was speaking and he had lots of {vocalsound} silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh {vocalsound} which was in the background and it was not {disfmarker} it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech {vocalsound} on the close {disfmarker} {vocalsound} close mike .\nGrad F:Hmm .\nPhD B:Oh the {disfmarker} What we talked about yesterday ?\nProfessor A:Yes .\nPhD B:Yeah that was actually my {disfmarker} I was wearing the {disfmarker} I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,\nProfessor A:Oh you {disfmarker} it was you I was Yeah .\nPhD B:and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that {disfmarker} mmm uh {disfmarker} that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . {vocalsound} And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the {disfmarker} the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but {vocalsound} maybe just a quick reprise of {disfmarker} of what we were saying this morning .\nGrad E:OK .\nProfessor A:Uh .\nGrad E:Um . {comment} So continuing to um extend\nPhD B:What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And {disfmarker} and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see .\nProfessor A:But that 's uh uh all {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} is a {disfmarker} a certainly relevant {comment} {vocalsound} uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nPhD B:Yeah .\nProfessor A:uh {vocalsound} what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found {disfmarker} finding useful\nPhD C:Hmm .\nProfessor A:um for {disfmarker}\nPhD B:And their {disfmarker} their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .\nProfessor A:Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nGrad E:Oh yeah .\nProfessor A:There 's those {vocalsound} {pause} that uh yeah , some of {disfmarker} some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on {disfmarker} on uh {vocalsound} what \" good features \" are and {disfmarker}\nPhD B:What does {disfmarker} what did um Larry Saul use for {disfmarker} it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he {disfmarker} H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What {disfmarker} what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see .\nProfessor A:And the other thing you were talking about is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the {disfmarker} what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels {vocalsound} from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this {disfmarker} this database ? This is the {disfmarker}\nPhD B:Hmm !\nProfessor A:And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah .\nPhD B:Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice . Weld it . Zzz .\nProfessor A:Maybe you could go to these parlors and {disfmarker} and you could , you know {disfmarker} you know have {disfmarker} have , you know , reduced rates if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you can do the measurements .\nPhD B:Yeah . I That 's right . You could {disfmarker} what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things\nProfessor A:Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science .\nPhD B:and Yeah .\nProfessor A:OK .\nPhD B:Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that {disfmarker} people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean {vocalsound} I can't remember where {disfmarker} uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of {disfmarker} Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I can't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting .\nProfessor A:Do you mean eh {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Mar\nPhD C:Well he was the guy {disfmarker} the guy that was using {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:you mean when was {disfmarker} was Mark Randolph there , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B:Mark Randolph .\nProfessor A:Yeah he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's at Motorola now .\nPhD B:Oh is he ?\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD B:Oh OK .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD B:Yeah .\nPhD C:Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B:I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know {disfmarker} I just remember it had to do with you know {vocalsound} uh positional parameters\nPhD C:What {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD B:and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them .\nPhD C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Yeah . So the only {disfmarker} the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so\nPhD B:Hmm .\nProfessor A:I don't know how complicated it is to go from there {disfmarker} What you really want are these binary {pause} labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um {vocalsound} if you did something instead that {disfmarker} like um having some manual annotation by {vocalsound} uh you know , linguistics students , this would {disfmarker} there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with {disfmarker} with John before\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:And then there would {disfmarker} it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is {vocalsound} boot trying to {disfmarker} to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from {vocalsound} uh the uh {vocalsound} uh the data itself there , but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure {disfmarker}\nPhD B:Could you cluster the {disfmarker} just do some kind of clustering ?\nProfessor A:Guess you could , yeah .\nPhD B:Bin them up into different categories and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:Yeah . So anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} I mean in general it 's gonna be {disfmarker} for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to {vocalsound} wear the pellets and {disfmarker} Um . So .\nGrad E:Right . Right .\nPhD B:So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones .\nGrad E:Right .\nPhD B:So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the true mappings are for each phone ?\nGrad E:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:I see .\nGrad E:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in {disfmarker} in my mind , I guess , is that um {vocalsound} we 're looking at different ways that we can combine {vocalsound} uh different kinds of {disfmarker} of rep front - end representations {vocalsound} um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from {vocalsound} uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have {vocalsound} a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that {vocalsound} to change some of the other methods we have , since {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} it um {disfmarker} the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a {disfmarker} a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than {vocalsound} um just assuming {vocalsound} that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength {vocalsound} towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it {disfmarker} so um {vocalsound} he 's got these um uh uh\nPhD B:Hmm .\nProfessor A:he \" AND 's \" between these different {vocalsound} features . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in {disfmarker} in principle {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different {disfmarker} soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh {vocalsound} multi - band channels . And um {vocalsound} the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" {disfmarker} \" AND ' ed \" things {vocalsound} is something that 's kept {vocalsound} uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is {disfmarker} is uh {vocalsound} taking {vocalsound} the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nPhD B:So he doesn't have {disfmarker}\nProfessor A:which means that it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's uh i It could be for instance {vocalsound} that for a particular point in the data {vocalsound} you don't want to um uh train a particular band {disfmarker} train the detectors for a particular band . You {disfmarker} you wanna ignore {vocalsound} that band , cuz that 's a {disfmarker} Ban - band is a noisy {disfmarker} noisy measure .\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:And we don't {disfmarker} We 're {disfmarker} we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well {disfmarker} well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .\nPhD B:So he doesn't have to have truth marks or {disfmarker} Ho\nGrad E:F right , and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels .\nProfessor A:Well at the {disfmarker} at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's {disfmarker} where it 's sonorant . But he 's {disfmarker} but what he 's - but what he 's not training up {disfmarker} uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\nGrad E:Right . For the full band .\nProfessor A:um I guess one way of describing would be if {disfmarker} if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ?\nGrad E:Right .\nProfessor A:Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So\nPhD B:Mm - hmm . OK .\nProfessor A:then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band {vocalsound} towards making your decision . And um {vocalsound} uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should {disfmarker} you should use everything {vocalsound} uh with {disfmarker} with uh equal strength .\nPhD B:I see .\nProfessor A:And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had {vocalsound} uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the {disfmarker} if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from {disfmarker} from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the {disfmarker}\nPhD B:So where did he get his {disfmarker} uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?\nGrad E:From uh canonical mappings {comment} um at first\nPhD B:OK .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nGrad E:and then it 's unclear um eh\nPhD B:Using TIMIT ? or using {disfmarker}\nGrad E:using TIMIT\nPhD B:Uh - huh .\nGrad E:right , right .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nGrad E:And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah .\nProfessor A:Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of {vocalsound} iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this {disfmarker} cuz then whatever {vocalsound} that alignment is , it 's that for all {disfmarker} all bands .\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate {disfmarker} tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still {vocalsound} not quite the same because then it 's {disfmarker} it 's um setting targets based on where you would say {vocalsound} the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a {vocalsound} soft {disfmarker} soft target uh {vocalsound} uh embedded {vocalsound} neural net training like we 've done a few times uh {vocalsound} f the forward um {disfmarker} do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ?\nPhD B:I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .\nProfessor A:Oh . You 're playing ?\nPhD B:I um Huh ?\nProfessor A:You 're playing ?\nPhD B:Yes , I 'm playing . Um {vocalsound} so I wanted to do this experiment to see um {vocalsound} uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um {disfmarker} I think I sent around last week a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where {vocalsound} I would take the um {disfmarker} the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for {vocalsound} the ICSI - OGI front - end .\nProfessor A:What {disfmarker} which test set was this ?\nPhD B:This is {disfmarker} that I looked at ?\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh {vocalsound} been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK {vocalsound} system for the Italian data and got the same results that um {disfmarker} that uh {vocalsound} Stephane had . So um I started looking {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} and now I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to {disfmarker} uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use {vocalsound} the same number of states for all of the models\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a {disfmarker} an HMM system is that you use {vocalsound} um three states per phone and um {vocalsound} so then the {disfmarker} the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . {vocalsound} Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use {vocalsound} uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five {vocalsound} which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but for the {disfmarker} most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So {vocalsound} my guess {disfmarker} uh And then if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I printed out a confusion matrix um {vocalsound} uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh you 've got {disfmarker} you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:So {vocalsound} it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's {disfmarker} because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific {vocalsound} um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .\nProfessor A:Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the {disfmarker} for the longer word ,\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:but .\nPhD B:Yeah so I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create {vocalsound} uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um {disfmarker} how these models were coming out , you know , what w {vocalsound} when we train up uh th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the {disfmarker} uh what do the transition probabilities look like {disfmarker} in the self - loops , {comment} look like in {disfmarker} in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can {vocalsound} calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did {disfmarker} quickly , I did the silence model and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the {vocalsound} string of digits .\nProfessor A:Wow . Lots of silence .\nPhD B:Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I {disfmarker} I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically {disfmarker} their {disfmarker} {vocalsound} their model for a whole digit string is silence {vocalsound} digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so .\nProfessor A:Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ?\nPhD B:I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nProfessor A:I see .\nPhD B:and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own {disfmarker} um It doesn't require its own training data ,\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:it just shares that state .\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm .\nPhD B:So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know {vocalsound} how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the {disfmarker} the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of {disfmarker} just from looking at the {vocalsound} durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .\nProfessor A:Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B:Yeah .\nProfessor A:The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:And uh\nPhD B:And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A:Could be .\nPhD B:And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A:Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B:Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A:Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B:Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A:Right .\nPhD B:So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B:Yeah .\nProfessor A:how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:um so\nPhD B:Right . Right .\nProfessor A:if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A:Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B:Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A:Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B:I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A:Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B:yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A:Yeah .\nPhD B:So .\nProfessor A:Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C:Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C:Big list ?\nProfessor A:You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B:Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E:I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B:Yeah ?\nGrad E:and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B:Octave .\nGrad E:Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B:Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E:Yeah .\nPhD B:I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A:Huh .\nGrad E:Yeah .\nPhD C:What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E:What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C:Yeah .\nGrad E:Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B:Great !\nGrad E:Yeah .\nPhD C:And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E:Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B:If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E:The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B:that 's perfect .\nGrad E:Yeah .\nPhD B:Great !\nProfessor A:OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E:OK .\nGrad F:Well , although by the way .\n", "summary": "The meeting began with the team catching up the professor, who had missed the previous meeting.

Let's try this . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Whoo .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um . Mm-hmm . Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh not . Oh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay . Yeah . No problem .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Shit happens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:A parrot . Ish .\nMarketing:Wow .

Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager:Very good .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nUser Interface:Uh blank .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Very good . So um you can always go back . {gap} So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . So {vocalsound} now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I will start .\nProject Manager:F first {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think .\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh g big buttons , {vocalsound} m uh that's easier to use than uh {disfmarker} I think . Not all the small buttons , you don't know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer:Big buttons , positive .\nProject Manager:Positive .\nIndustrial Designer:All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for .\nProject Manager:Okay . What are your experiences ?\nUser Interface:Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:And that it controls the channels and the the volume . And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it {disfmarker} in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . And uh yeah . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So and do they always have that ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , but {disfmarker} No no no . But I {disfmarker} my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that .\nProject Manager:It's easy to you .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . 'Kay .\nMarketing:Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Thank you .\nMarketing:That's not really ea easy .\nIndustrial Designer:Help also . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nMarketing:So it would be nice if we have one for all . And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v {vocalsound} not easy to use . So we n barely used it .\nProject Manager:Okay so they have too much . So next .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The weight . Not not too heavy .\nProject Manager:Not too heavy . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Not much buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some {gap} {disfmarker} uh some sort of bleep .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Like a phone .\nIndustrial Designer:And then you uh , hey there there's remote control .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So ,\nIndustrial Designer:Next .\nProject Manager:that's {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah well that's {disfmarker} that are good ideas . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah I think it uh {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .\nProject Manager:Okay . This is {disfmarker} It has to be compatible with other things .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I have one more idea . Just popped up .\nProject Manager:Yes ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't {disfmarker} won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .\nProject Manager:No battery use . So more ideas ?\nUser Interface:Mm no .\nProject Manager:No okay . It's only the first ideas . So {vocalsound} uh what are we going to do now is {disfmarker} Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do . Well look on your {gap} . And {disfmarker} Next instructions you'll get in your email . So {disfmarker} This is the first meeting . See you later in half an hour .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Thank you .\nMarketing:Okay .\n", "summary": "Project Manager introduced the overall plan for designing the product that has to be original, trendy and user-friendly to the team and asked each team member to draw a painting with a technical device.

[{"id": 0, "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and Jack Sargeant. Vikki Howells is substituting for Jack Sargeant. So, Vikki, welcome; it's good to see you in the committee. Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. So thank you all for attending this afternoon. We're really looking forward to hearing your views on the Bill. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Siân Gwenllian.\nBarry Hughes:Perfectly happy.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Thank you very much. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment—how does that protect children.\nBarry Hughes:Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children?\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes.\nBarry Hughes:We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. That is a defence that is available for assault upon a child. By way of contrast, it is not available for an offence involving an adult. In that regard, it could be argued that children have fewer rights than adults.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form—that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007.\nBarry Hughes:I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. So one would hope that the law will change to reflect the way in which people behave within society.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay, thank you. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework—that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that?\nBarry Hughes:I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the—. It may be helpful to look at some examples at some stage. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. In that sense, matters were clarified, because up until that point it was not entirely clear. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. And the Children Act was brought in to reflect the direction that the case law was moving in. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. So, there was a decision made back then that it was appropriate to do that. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children—some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. And removing that defence does make life clearer.\nSian Gwenllian AM:What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples?\nBarry Hughes:If you take an example—so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child—a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road—who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. The parent grabs hold of the child and pulls them back. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. Of course, that would be utter nonsense. There's no hostility; it's simply taking hold of a child to protect them. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. Now, that would probably be seen under the present law as reasonable chastisement. Probably. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. So, that, I would say, sits at one end of the spectrum. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. So, there is a spectrum of offending. Towards one end of the spectrum we move much closer towards something that would be criminal in nature. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. We would then decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey?\nSian Gwenllian AM:But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. Because if you're removing this—we'll probably come on to that.\nBarry Hughes:Shall I address that in terms—? Okay. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is—. And you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. It's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the Crown Prosecution Service. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case—the light smacking on the leg—at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think—and I think this is what will probably happen in practice—that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is—it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. So, it may be referred to the CPS for a charging decision. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute.\nSian Gwenllian AM:But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying?\nBarry Hughes:If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Thanks.\nLynne Neagle AM:We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. Hello. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that?\nBarry Hughes:Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this—and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing—that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. And so, there are issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the public. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 µg in 100 ml of breath. Across the border in Scotland, it drops to 22 µg. So, the same act—. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 µg; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. We will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise. And we think that we are sufficiently flexible to take account of that.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that?\nBarry Hughes:Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. There will be a further series of awareness raising. We have strategic implementation groups—Iwan sits on that group. So, we would build ourselves up to come up with the appropriate guidance according to the circumstances. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences—and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other—\nDawn Bowden AM:And that would be primarily around the public interest issue.\nBarry Hughes:It would.\nDawn Bowden AM:I understand. Okay. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation?\nBarry Hughes:My own personal involvement?\nDawn Bowden AM:Or the service's.\nBarry Hughes:Iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister—I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago—to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. So you've been satisfied with the level of involvement that you've had.\nBarry Hughes:Yes. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance.\nBarry Hughes:I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that.\nDawn Bowden AM:And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales—well, and in England, actually, across the border—will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?\nBarry Hughes:Not as of the present day. Give us a chance. [Laughter.]\nDawn Bowden AM:But you would expect that to be something you would—\nBarry Hughes:Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. So, actually, I'm probably being unfair to myself. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes?\nBarry Hughes:They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. We have regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law.\nDawn Bowden AM:That's helpful, thank you. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation.\nBarry Hughes:In addition to those that I've mentioned, probably not. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that.\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. That's fine. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:I've got a supplementary from Suzy, and then Siân.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you. I was going to ask this question later, but I think it fits in—. I've forgotten what I was going to ask; this is terrible. Oh no, that's right—obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision?\nBarry Hughes:I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. I've had some discussions with Kwame, who would have an involvement in this. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. So, it would be taking principles of generality and according them a degree of specificity. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that.\nSuzy Davies AM:It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. But thank you, anyway; I take your point.\nLynne Neagle AM:Siân.\nSian Gwenllian AM:My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion?\nBarry Hughes:There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet—let's not stretch that into children. [Laughter.] But, you know, sometimes—I'll be quiet. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence—. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this—. If I can give you another example. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. Sometimes they admonish them verbally and then that turns into physical admonishment. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying—but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. That seems to me to not necessarily fit with where we ought to be as a society.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point?\nBarry Hughes:Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment—who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say.\nLynne Neagle AM:We've got some specific questions around implementation now from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'?\nBarry Hughes:I understand your point. There's no change whatsoever to the burden of proof, nor to the standard of proof.\nSuzy Davies AM:Perhaps you can run us through it quickly.\nBarry Hughes:If the defence argue that that act was—. So, we have to show that there's been an unlawful assault. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. That's great.\nBarry Hughes:And we've got to disprove that to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. So, you can certainly see—. I can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter, to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial, and it would be our responsibility to disprove that.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. That's really helpful for us to understand that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door?\nBarry Hughes:From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there.\nSuzy Davies AM:That's fine. I was expecting that answer.\nBarry Hughes:Simply because that's a matter for the police. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate—. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. We can't direct the police.\nSuzy Davies AM:Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes—if it does—for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law?\nBarry Hughes:I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. I think we need to keep abreast of things as they move forward. We need involvement—Iwan, for example, and the strategic implementation group. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose—at least, 'adequate' might sound a little—\nSuzy Davies AM:Sufficient.\nBarry Hughes:Yes, perfectly sufficient.\nSuzy Davies AM:So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like.\nBarry Hughes:Fit for purpose, yes.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes. Okay, that's great. Bear with me a second—thank you very much—in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this?\nBarry Hughes:If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. But there isn't anything significant. There's nothing that will impact upon our performance as the public prosecution service in that time.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this.\nBarry Hughes:Certainly. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will—. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. But this would be a very specific flag for assault on a child—reasonable chastisement. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales—it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. So, we would keep a manual log of every referral. That would be unmanageable if we were dealing with hundreds and hundreds of cases.\nSuzy Davies AM:So, you're not anticipating hundreds and hundreds.\nBarry Hughes:Not at all. Not at all. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. If that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. So, you're talking small numbers. Now, small numbers—and we might not have any. Okay? It depends. Obviously, if there's a really good awareness-raising campaign, you make it less likely. And, for us, prosecution—it's not the first port of call here at all. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever—12, 18 months, maybe 24 months—where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. We do this already with certain types of offences. We have what we call local scrutiny involvement panels. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which I mean people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. We'd bring them in and look through the cases. So, we open our books, show them our cases, and we have a very frank discussion. We involve the police in that as well. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. And I'd like to think that the Welsh Government would be involved in that as well.\nSuzy Davies AM:That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. It's nobody's fault; that's just how it is. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example—the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question.\nBarry Hughes:I can attempt an answer. I follow entirely where you're going. I agree, the chances are pretty low, but they're greater than they are presently. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay, that's really helpful, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Before we move on, can I just ask—? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18—\nBarry Hughes:Sixteen.\nLynne Neagle AM:You mentioned 16; that's what I wanted to clarify. Our understanding was that it went up to 18.\nBarry Hughes:I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now specifically on prosecutions and potential alternatives from Vikki Howells.\nVikki Howells AM:Thank you, Chair. You've already touched quite a bit on the issue of the public interest test. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill?\nBarry Hughes:Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which—I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child—say, a four-year-old—in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. Now, there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. Some of them are fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. But there's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted.\nVikki Howells AM:Thank you, that's really useful, and—\nLynne Neagle AM:Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Now, I've looked at the code and there is a section about impact on the victim. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution?\nBarry Hughes:Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. It may be that there are—. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. It's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. Suzy, you've got a supplementary on that.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed.\nBarry Hughes:That's a really interesting question. There is a body of law that—\nSuzy Davies AM:A child can't consent to assault.\nBarry Hughes:Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain—. The law is really quite difficult. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far—you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery—splitting people's tongues. That went too far as well. So, there is again—I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. So, the law has considered that in some depth. I'm still not entirely clear, and I speak as a lawyer. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, because we're talking below a certain standard here as well. Okay.\nBarry Hughes:As to what you can consent to, it's less clear. It would need to be developed.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay, thank you for that.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Vikki.\nVikki Howells AM:Thank you. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?\nBarry Hughes:We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something—. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say—for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth—we  think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility—that will fall to the police—but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help?\nVikki Howells AM:It does. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill—how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited?\nBarry Hughes:The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved—the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction.\nVikki Howells AM:And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion?\nBarry Hughes:Somewhere within Wales—Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. I'm not the right person to answer that question.\nVikki Howells AM:Okay. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. There's no such duty proposed in this Bill. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales?\nBarry Hughes:I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example?\nBarry Hughes:It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here—by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes—if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on the unintended consequences from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence—would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence.\nBarry Hughes:Yes. Okay. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted—so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution—. It may be—the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. We probably would end up prosecuting, because it's a relatively serious offence. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child—in circumstances that would not have happened in England—then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. But I think, along the road there, there would have been an element of choice.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident?\nBarry Hughes:Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. They're likely to be very limited. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales—this was the review in 2007—it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales—and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally—you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Thank you for that. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures?\nBarry Hughes:I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. In the CPS, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets—it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean.\nSian Gwenllian AM:What about—? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence?\nBarry Hughes:I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. That disappeared some years ago. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. The police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. It's much less of an issue than it ever was—much.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. This happens now, of course. Is that going to increase if we change the law?\nBarry Hughes:There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners—whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. I can see it potentially arising. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law?\nBarry Hughes:No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. And I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Finally from me, therefore—another issue, in a way—the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point.\nBarry Hughes:Right. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. There are various parties who would disagree with that, but that was the then Government's position. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law—so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK—that case law could come from other countries within the European Union.\nBarry Hughes:It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.]\nSuzy Davies AM:[Inaudible.]—like common law jurisdictions would be.\nBarry Hughes:Yes. At this point in time, that'd be a bit of a punt.\nLynne Neagle AM:Yes. Okay. Thank you. Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Yes. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that?\nBarry Hughes:There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about—. There are over—. From memory—please never hold me to this—but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. There are some offences on the statute—. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. So, we have various defences to do with Acts. I remember seeing some about Antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant—what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. So, awareness is important and it comes back to that point.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise?\nBarry Hughes:No. It's a potential barrier, but I don't think it is a barrier. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. I've got no significant concerns, I have to say.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? You will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. Thank you again for your time in coming here today. Diolch yn fawr.\nBarry Hughes:Thank you. It's been a pleasure.\nLynne Neagle AM:Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Business Committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the Bill, which has now been agreed. Paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services requesting some further information from CAFCASS Cymru on the Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Minister for Education regarding Diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 July. Are Members happy to note those? Item 4, then. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.\n", "summary": "This meeting was the eleventh evidence session on the Children Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Publishment Wales Bill. Barry Hughes was there to answer questions related to the Bill. Six main topics that had been discussed or explained. The first one was how the Bill protected the children in terms of prosecutions. The second part explained the divergence between regions and the Bill's implication on England. The third part explained how the law was implemented, and the fourth talked about prosecutions and potential alternatives. Barry Hughes then further explained our-of-court disposals and responded to a specific infrastructure for these cases. In the last part, the meeting turned to discuss a number of unintended consequences related to the Bill.", "length": 14659},

Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment .\nProject Manager:Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and uh m maximise the profits\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:and um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but that's not what uh has been asked .\nProject Manager:I know , I know .\nIndustrial Designer:So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . {vocalsound} It's not that innovative .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Or however you s pronounce that .\nUser Interface:Yeah , too bad . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um so , okay . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's true .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .\nProject Manager:We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Is it fancy ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think so .\nUser Interface:Um the yellow rubber , I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:I think so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So uh one ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But it's not that fancy .\nProject Manager:No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . It would be even more {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You like tita {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's a flavour as well .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It has flavour . Yes , that's right . {vocalsound} You should taste it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Right . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I know ,\nMarketing:Is it uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It has to do with fashion , I guess .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So do {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And w\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy .\nProject Manager:It applies . It {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I I agree .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good .\nMarketing:Okay , and uh was it innovative ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That would have been a thrill .\nIndustrial Designer:yes , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So uh also a uh two ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think uh it's a two .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nMarketing:Is it easy to use ?\nProject Manager:I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker} I think a three .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more .\nProject Manager:Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh Roo , a three ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Ruud ?\nMarketing:Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .\nProject Manager:So I could make it e easy ?\nUser Interface:If you make it a four it will be three in general .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's w No , two and a half .\nUser Interface:If he makes it a four . Not a three .\nIndustrial Designer:Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Darn . Nee .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Hmm ? Huh ?\nProject Manager:Roo . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .\nMarketing:Yeah . I yeah {gap} .\nUser Interface:A four and a three together .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Four ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Two ?\nMarketing:two , two , three {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No ,\nUser Interface:And a three ?\nProject Manager:I haven't said anything yet .\nUser Interface:Nee . I know .\nMarketing:No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .\nIndustrial Designer:Divided by four .\nUser Interface:Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:But I'm filling in a three .\nIndustrial Designer:That's not even {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But that's not possible to fill in ,\nProject Manager:Yes , it is .\nIndustrial Designer:so we have to round it . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .\nIndustrial Designer:It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy .\nProject Manager:Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:But even without it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So , I th\nProject Manager:we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um Sebastian ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , me too .\nUser Interface:Me too .\nMarketing:Yeah , I agree .\nProject Manager:Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .\nUser Interface:Was it one of our options ?\nIndustrial Designer:No , it's not one of our option ,\nMarketing:No . Uh\nProject Manager:No okay , but but\nUser Interface:So , in the in {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker}\nMarketing:this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:for the options given , it's the most spongy one .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yes ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , but it's not good enough ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I'll give it a one .\nIndustrial Designer:so it's a two .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one .\nIndustrial Designer:You take one ? What do you give it ?\nMarketing:Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:but {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time .\nMarketing:Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .\nUser Interface:It will be a one . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .\nIndustrial Designer:No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You are {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The remote control offers enough features .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?\nMarketing:Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable .\nMarketing:Yeah , depends .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I know .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's quite advanced .\nProject Manager:What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has .\nProject Manager:I think it has .\nMarketing:Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat\nProject Manager:Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals .\nIndustrial Designer:Has uh the signals sent to it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Signal .\nProject Manager:So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .\nIndustrial Designer:Absolutely .\nProject Manager:Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .\nUser Interface:I'll give a two .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one .\nMarketing:Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So high quality , low acceptance .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:D do you agree ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , I agree . I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh {vocalsound} function . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes .\nUser Interface:But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?\nProject Manager:Twenty five Euros .\nUser Interface:Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:M about fifty Euros .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's quite ex\nUser Interface:That's price , but w w\nIndustrial Designer:well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .\nUser Interface:No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .\nProject Manager:Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:and this one does .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So I think it's worth its price .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh\nProject Manager:That's counting .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .\nMarketing:should be about one point s seven ,\nUser Interface:Four six seven eight .\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Nine divided by six .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um {disfmarker} What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Try to translate that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Any any other {disfmarker} Uh , Roo ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Ye\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Roo . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The process was good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Actually , we had {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:the the choice between {gap} what {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Better decision .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We had we had too little information actually .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} And uh um the the the {disfmarker} well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too {disfmarker} the the choice of components was way too narrow .\nProject Manager:Less . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So there was not really a process of uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So we could we we could be {disfmarker} we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker} Yes .\nMarketing:The prices .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We we thought of possibilities {vocalsound} who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:We're tempered by that , yes .\nProject Manager:Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ?\nUser Interface:No , no .\nProject Manager:Ruud ?\nMarketing:I agree .\nProject Manager:You agree , okay . Uh leadership .\nUser Interface:Fantastic . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , {gap} okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I think we're a good team .\nProject Manager:I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh {gap} . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} So um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but but si uh w w w {gap} {disfmarker} when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well .\nIndustrial Designer:I think so too .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Um\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Because of the response\nIndustrial Designer:It {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Response\nIndustrial Designer:The response is very slow\nUser Interface:and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh it it has {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its {disfmarker} um uh where it uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Draws .\nUser Interface:Yeah , where it draws . It's uh {disfmarker} the drawing on on the b on the board is {gap} r right from the pen .\nProject Manager:Okay , so\nUser Interface:So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ?\nUser Interface:You to take in account that your {disfmarker} you m\nProject Manager:Uh yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe it's {disfmarker} it needs to be calibrateds .\nUser Interface:It's too slow {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:It is ?\nProject Manager:So uh it's not the calibration ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:it's the thing itself , I think .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ?\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Not at all .\nMarketing:Not really .\nProject Manager:Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:I I think so too .\nProject Manager:although I would like to see um O_C_R_ .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Yes .\nUser Interface:If it has O_C_R_ {vocalsound} , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:To digitise them .\nUser Interface:Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I type faster than I write .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy {disfmarker} it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not quite uh ergonomic . Eco ergonomic .\nUser Interface:Economic .\nProject Manager:I know .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay . Um {disfmarker} What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?\nMarketing:Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can't say much about it .\nProject Manager:I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:No , or the other way around .\nProject Manager:Or the other way around , that you could show {disfmarker} but m\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , yes .\nUser Interface:But y you can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That's quite what PowerPoint does .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I know .\nUser Interface:if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder .\nProject Manager:I know , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So it's almost {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I know , but we couldn't use that feature ,\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:so I missed it .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:We weren't able to do that . At least the {disfmarker} um I wasn't explained how to do such a th\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . {gap} . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object .\nIndustrial Designer:An object , yes . Yes .\nUser Interface:I it's not possible {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:The drawing cap capabilities are very limited .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And and uh w you were {disfmarker} when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh it looks like paint actually .\nProject Manager:Okay , so y it {disfmarker} it's not even as advanced as paint .\nIndustrial Designer:Not not uh n not {gap} way .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's quite uh limited .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh no . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Oh , very good , celebration .\nProject Manager:Celebrate\nUser Interface:Great . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Pop uh pop up the champagne . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Um\nUser Interface:It was a privilege working with you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you're dismissed . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , I think we are uh ready .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:To private rooms ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I see some action over there .\nProject Manager:Private room , Roo . That sounds quite scary .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:No , let's find uh the way to {gap} . {vocalsound} {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} uh we're done , we're finished , {gap} I believe . So , are there any more cycles in this process ? I think not .\nProject Manager:I don't believe so . Well , maybe we'd {disfmarker} get an email . Thank you for your {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But um how much time did we get for this meeting ?\nProject Manager:Forty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer:And how much time is left ?\nProject Manager:A minute or or ten maybe . M\nIndustrial Designer:Ten minutes .\nProject Manager:Yeah , ten or five .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:So , we can uh redesign our uh {disfmarker} Uh I would like to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box .\nMarketing:And no added value . At all .\nIndustrial Designer:No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nUser Interface:But you see the problem ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:y you can't continue your uh your line . Well , it's fluffy alright . {vocalsound} Spongy . A giraffe ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:What is that ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's a giraffe eating a {disfmarker} eating leaves from a tree .\nProject Manager:It's blue tongue .\nMarketing:In interesting design .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} This is a new model . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Or blue tongue . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Blue tongue . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's spongy . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} . {vocalsound} That is uh {disfmarker} it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Blue tongue .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Let's wrap it up .\nProject Manager:Yeah , we're done here .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Gentlemen , thank you for your cooperation .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you Mister manager . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Now , {vocalsound} let's have uh a bottle of champagne .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} . Leave it here .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:That's alright . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} .\nMarketing:{gap} .\nProject Manager:{gap}\n", "summary": "This is the fourth meeting of the design group. The group firstly introduced a prototype which contained the characteristics determined at the last meeting. Then Project Manager pointed out that since the production costs were over budget, they should reduce costs by leaving out solar cells, not using voice recognition and changing the button material into plastics. Then the group went through the evaluation criteria of the product. They thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. When evaluating the project, the group considered that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. Eventually, the group decided to redesign the product.", "length": 12595},
{"id": 2, "conversations": "Marketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And I can start if you want . Mm .\nProject Manager:sure .\nMarketing:Is there an order ? No .\nProject Manager:Hm ?\nMarketing:We haven't decided on an order .\nProject Manager:No , any any order's fine . Yeah .\nMarketing:First . Okay . Um , how do I put this {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Just uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I'll just put the cable in .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah , sorry .\nMarketing:{gap} Is that it ? Can you see ? {vocalsound} Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ?\nProject Manager:It sh it takes a few seconds I think .\nIndustrial Designer:You may need to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Who's that ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:But sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Is it in the right thing ?\nIndustrial Designer:it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .\nMarketing:Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh , and then press function .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and F_ eight .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh , wait .\nUser Interface:oh .\nMarketing:That's {disfmarker} is that it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Adjusting .\nProject Manager:Here we are . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it .\nMarketing:Right here we are .\nProject Manager:Oh . Is it on ?\nMarketing:We're here .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .\nProject Manager:Hm .\nMarketing:Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Just move right on .\nUser Interface:Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh function F_ eight .\nMarketing:Function F_ eight .\nUser Interface:'Kay . What's function ?\nProject Manager:It's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th\nUser Interface:Oh function , I see it .\nProject Manager:yeah . Yeah should be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:There we go . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It should be {gap} yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um {vocalsound} so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} That concludes my presentation .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh .\nIndustrial Designer:How do I um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:S That's on view .\nIndustrial Designer:Right .\nMarketing:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nUser Interface:Do you know about like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm ?\nUser Interface:I dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .\nUser Interface:Okay . Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . {vocalsound} Do {disfmarker} Let's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Like in terms of\nMarketing:How it looks or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:how it looks , or like what it does ?\nProject Manager:wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay . So {disfmarker} Is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . Mm .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's easy to implement .\nUser Interface:Okay . So the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{gap} the the buzzer you mean ,\nUser Interface:yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Locator .\nMarketing:yeah , for sure , yeah .\nUser Interface:So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .\nUser Interface:what was it ?\nMarketing:Well that's for speech recognition .\nProject Manager:Oh , uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen .\nIndustrial Designer:I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not sure how you would implement it .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I just put the values {vocalsound} in .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But um the screen is the same as what , {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:It's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , I'm happy with that .\nProject Manager:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Right so um {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Hu yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Completely .\nUser Interface:Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .\nIndustrial Designer:Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:right . Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:So do you plug it in the T_ {disfmarker} you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .\nMarketing:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:So it's now like a two-part thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , so it would be a two part package .\nUser Interface:Okay . Alright .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:So we get to design that too .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Make it fashionable . Um , okay .\nProject Manager:So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think so .\nMarketing:Yeah . Just there .\nProject Manager:Huh . Okay .\nMarketing:Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?\nProject Manager:We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Then it can live anywhere .\nProject Manager:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . For the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ?\nMarketing:Are we just having a radio ? On the phone .\nIndustrial Designer:Um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,\nUser Interface:T\nMarketing:You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think that's what the phone has ,\nMarketing:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .\nProject Manager:And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so\nMarketing:You can hear it's under the couch yeah .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:So i Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , {vocalsound} {gap} So need the other buttons . So we have this {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager:So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That was that was me .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:they're {disfmarker} I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .\nUser Interface:I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes .\nProject Manager:Oh really . 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .\nUser Interface:And uh\nIndustrial Designer:Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:They're not {disfmarker} no .\nMarketing:They're not , no .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .\nUser Interface:S\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's right , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It not V_H_S_ here ?\nProject Manager:But D_V_D_ probably is .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , other than that region and coding thing .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .\nMarketing:But V_C_R_s {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , for sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can {disfmarker} I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much ,\nProject Manager:S\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Huh .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:s and it's usually that red\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You know , I've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh okay , yeah .\nUser Interface:It seems like that would be hard though .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It might be confusing . Yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't {disfmarker} I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I never think to hold something down . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I have the power {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . B {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well even um iPod thing {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of\nUser Interface:That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .\nMarketing:scrolling {disfmarker} I don't know .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . Because people li seem {disfmarker} now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no {disfmarker} Know you don't have one two three four five {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:it's it's funny like you f like I just {disfmarker} I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and {disfmarker} it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah , it's just {disfmarker} and it's one thing which has everything .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and it is {disfmarker} yeah . It is really {disfmarker} but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?\nMarketing:Well can't it tell the {disfmarker} like can't you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .\nProject Manager:Oh that's gonna {disfmarker} Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like {disfmarker} it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .\nProject Manager:okay . I've never used one . No .\nMarketing:It's like l this {disfmarker} like that , and then you do that .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah and then .\nMarketing:And then you can have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .\nUser Interface:Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that {disfmarker} Or it {disfmarker} oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well i\nUser Interface:zap .\nMarketing:Yeah , click o actually click on to have {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom {disfmarker} So do you need to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Doesn't it rotate though ,\nUser Interface:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so it'll be moving around .\nUser Interface:Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What do you mean the function ?\nUser Interface:I mean like okay , 'cause so {disfmarker} I dunno , I guess {disfmarker} Okay {disfmarker} so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:But then {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so if you wanna switch to the {disfmarker} to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .\nMarketing:Yeah but it knows for some reason .\nUser Interface:It just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:The iPod knows .\nUser Interface:It just kno {vocalsound} the iPod knows . {vocalsound} S\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} If it works on an iPod then it works .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Huh .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't have one .\nMarketing:Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .\nUser Interface:Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:So it's like holding {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And then {disfmarker} well if you do that it goes , but if you {disfmarker} like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .\nProject Manager:You can {disfmarker} o And you you {disfmarker} is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually {disfmarker} you're just using the mouse to go up and down .\nMarketing:Well what you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's like a b\nMarketing:for the iPod you press an {disfmarker} w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Like you could just have {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't know ,\nProject Manager:Oh , like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:you could click and then have it up and down ,\nProject Manager:Oh you could actually {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:but I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be {disfmarker} is that part of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I don't think so .\nUser Interface:yeah , I dunno , I dunno .\nProject Manager:they have so much memory though , that's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You don't think so ? Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think it's the wheel dealy .\nMarketing:I think it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they {disfmarker} it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I'm thinking we could {disfmarker} if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .\nIndustrial Designer:And they're re-programmable aren't they ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:You can put on your songs and then put on a different set ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:S\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah . Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation {vocalsound} , is that people find it {disfmarker} find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and that's another thing they complained about .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume {disfmarker} oh we've ts just said that .\nUser Interface:So okay .\nMarketing:Channel selection .\nUser Interface:This is just for T_V_ , it's not for {disfmarker} or it is {disfmarker} does need to be compatible with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker} A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .\nUser Interface:So how do you switch {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Menu .\nIndustrial Designer:and menu maybe . Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay . So like if we had that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But we'll hold off on that 'cause {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But s yeah uh .\nMarketing:But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .\nUser Interface:That's true , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So , I know I'm not c really clear on what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm . Mm .\nUser Interface:So you'd have to have like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can {disfmarker} you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nMarketing:Yeah , it is only fun\nUser Interface:but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .\nProject Manager:But i Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . But I think the circle only does {disfmarker} channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah but it {disfmarker} it would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different {disfmarker} I mean do we need to think about that ,\nProject Manager:Um , yeah , let's think about it\nUser Interface:that like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes we can try that .\nProject Manager:'cause we need to wrap up .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\n", "summary": "The meeting started by discussing the functional design of the remote control. Marketing gave the study on user needs and target groups. User Interface gave the presentation on technical effect design and Industrial Designer gave the presentation on working design. Then Project Manager initiated new project requirements brainstorming. The group had agreed on the on-call button design, DVD capability button design, power button design, and denied speech recognition design as well as mouse pad design. They would further discuss the function switch button and its compatibility in the next meeting.", "length": 9199},
{"id": 6, "conversations": "Project Manager:So , I will open our functional design meeting .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So , I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um\nIndustrial Designer:Industrial Design .\nMarketing:Marketing Expert .\nProject Manager:What's your talk ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Marketing Experts . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um , so you're participant two ?\nIndustrial Designer:One one .\nUser Interface:No no no .\nProject Manager:No you're {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:One .\nProject Manager:No ,\nIndustrial Designer:Three three , it's three\nProject Manager:I'm participant one . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:sorry {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:I I think I'm a {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay , never mind .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:'Kay , did you save your presentation ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:In one .\nIndustrial Designer:In one , sorry {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Isn't that technical functions ?\nMarketing:No sure .\nIndustrial Designer:So you didn't save it maybe .\nMarketing:Uh\nUser Interface:It's mine .\nMarketing:it's David Jordan . Course .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So\nIndustrial Designer:David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .\nProject Manager:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Too great for email then .\nUser Interface:Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh I I will focus on user interface design .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Um so move to the next slide . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very {disfmarker} has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I {disfmarker} so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller {vocalsound} which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's the end of the talk {vocalsound} the end of the presentation .\nProject Manager:So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker} With sophisticated functions ,\nProject Manager:So powerful ,\nUser Interface:but with very {disfmarker} yeah powerful .\nProject Manager:many functions and very easy to use .\nUser Interface:Yes . Yep .\nMarketing:So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both ,\nIndustrial Designer:To merge the two system huh .\nMarketing:I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You mean this one ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yep .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:But But this is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But if we have very very good user interface\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it take less time for user to learn how to use it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah you {disfmarker} maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are {disfmarker} or almost the same , so the sign .\nProject Manager:Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .\nMarketing:Oh it should {disfmarker} okay , yeah . The user should know .\nIndustrial Designer:So you have to {disfmarker} The sh the user there {disfmarker} for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that {disfmarker} So .\nProject Manager:Yeah um such as maybe the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So .\nProject Manager:Go on , go back and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's gonna be the trick . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's my job . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's your job {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It you {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Powerful and easy to use .\nMarketing:So that's the point .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's the point .\nProject Manager:So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , okay .\nProject Manager:So you you're {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Participant two . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um . Okay .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:True .\nProject Manager:So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen ,\nMarketing:What the cost is ?\nProject Manager:yeah . The cost {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Twelve , twelve a half .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .\nMarketing:That might just {disfmarker} So .\nIndustrial Designer:You can go to the next slide .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .\nProject Manager:What is this ?\nIndustrial Designer:This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?\nMarketing:What's the average price of this technology then ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the\nUser Interface:So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu\nMarketing:But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but in a sense {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:sometime I want to have wire because you know .\nProject Manager:Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:The wire ?\nProject Manager:As it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . True .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yeah .\nProject Manager:I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Uh that's my job . That's the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry .\nMarketing:Now the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:just think of um the usability .\nUser Interface:Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television ,\nMarketing:Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:This you will see in my presentation then .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You mean the loo the look , the outside ?\nIndustrial Designer:The look , how it look like .\nMarketing:Yeah , the the look is is bad for them\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So this is from the experiments we've done ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ?\nMarketing:R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Ah um okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,\nUser Interface:Functions .\nMarketing:this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Sure ? Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?\nUser Interface:But I'm not sure {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .\nMarketing:Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the\nIndustrial Designer:The manuals .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nMarketing:manual .\nProject Manager:I think the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No you you can have a switch menu , so you can\nProject Manager:Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .\nUser Interface:well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay . Okay ,\nUser Interface:Then you you put the switch button ,\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .\nIndustrial Designer:With a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny {disfmarker} look fancy , not funny .\nIndustrial Designer:Look fancy .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:This is a question that should be asked to the {disfmarker} If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people {gap} .\nUser Interface:Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah , this is something we sh\nUser Interface:Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some {disfmarker} for other peoples , so .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .\nMarketing:Specially distribution , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .\nProject Manager:If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , it will cost little bit more .\nUser Interface:Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:some people prefer black remote control .\nMarketing:Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .\nProject Manager:And also f\nUser Interface:Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so user can select which colour they prefer , so .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:remember it's twelve Euros .\nProject Manager:and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and to discuss it with uh the other members .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?\nMarketing:Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So .\nProject Manager:So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It's is uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Lame , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nProject Manager:So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nProject Manager:and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .\nUser Interface:Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm\nProject Manager:because if we want to to do remote control\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?\nUser Interface:Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .\nProject Manager:So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .\nUser Interface:Mm-hm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:of the uh of real reaction\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So .\nProject Manager:and uh also {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So has to be yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:Yellow .\nProject Manager:Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .\nUser Interface:Okay . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Require lot of requirements ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} For cheap {vocalsound} remote control , yeah .\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . And cheap .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:A low cost .\nProject Manager:Yeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:This is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .\nProject Manager:Maybe not ,\nMarketing:It's maybe more in browsing .\nProject Manager:but mayb\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .\nUser Interface:Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Ok\nMarketing:Hm-mm .\nUser Interface:It's It's not so uh popular now . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:the global usage ,\nUser Interface:Global ,\nIndustrial Designer:so if people don't have the technology .\nUser Interface:okay .\nProject Manager:So .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?\nUser Interface:So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ?\nProject Manager:I think it has to be yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yellow ? {gap} T_V_ remote control ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Min\nProject Manager:Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be .\nProject Manager:Why you go {disfmarker} It has to be fashion .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow ,\nProject Manager:So you have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:but just mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so .\nUser Interface:Okay , okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:And also it has to be attractive , of course ,\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:because if you want to sale {disfmarker} to sell the remote control . It's okay ?\nMarketing:Regarding the first line , what {disfmarker} So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:And that's it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .\nMarketing:It's already changed for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think it would be simpler .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay . So {disfmarker} I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . Uh {disfmarker} Y you {disfmarker} You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um {disfmarker} pon\nMarketing:Industrial Designer .\nIndustrial Designer:Industrial Designer , yeah . Component component , yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:And Florent to work my subject .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's okay ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think the um session is closed .\nIndustrial Designer:Good .\nProject Manager:And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . {vocalsound} Not in mine .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay {vocalsound} Okay , that's clear .\nUser Interface:Okay {vocalsound} . Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Should be better . {vocalsound}\n", "summary": "This was a functional design meeting. Based on the presentations of the user interface designer, the industrial designer and the marketing expert, the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful, easy to use, fashionable, recognizable, only for television and Internet-connected. After discussing the industrial design of the product, the group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller with less buttons but whether the product would be wireless was still unsolved. As for the product appearance, the group decided to make the product look fancy and recognizable; nevertheless, they had different opinions on the colour of the product.", "length": 8329},

It's Ada Longmund ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . So um we will have to um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . Record . So the project method is the following . So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The tool training is to try out the white board , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe someone ha we have to {gap} this whiteboard ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Maybe you can draw your favourite animal\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and make a list of its favourite characteristics .\nMarketing:So right now ?\nProject Manager:I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .\nUser Interface:So yeah I think you can do it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I don't know .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Twenty five Euros ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I think it's quite good price , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I it's it's reasonable , s quite {disfmarker} yeah . Twenty five .\nMarketing:It's reasonable , I think , yeah .\nProject Manager:And uh\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it will uh be a an international remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer:Is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um {disfmarker} with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with {vocalsound} remote const con controls ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:try to create something new and people would like to to buy . And {vocalsound} and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know {disfmarker} I suppose you know what you have to do . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . I I hope so {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .\nMarketing:Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I_D_ ,\nMarketing:okay .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer ,\nUser Interface:That's me .\nMarketing:Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah ?\nMarketing:and Marketing Expert , it's me .\nIndustrial Designer:AMI yeah project .\nProject Manager:So I will manage all all the group .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} you will be the manager {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound}\nMarketing:You can manage all this , yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Good .\nProject Manager:So you have questions ?\nMarketing:Um . Not really .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:you all know what the parts of the work you have to do .\nMarketing:So which {disfmarker} you , the Industrial Designer .\nUser Interface:No I'm user interf I'm user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer:I am the Industrial Design , yeah\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:And you ?\nIndustrial Designer:I am the Industrial Designer so .\nProject Manager:Mm okay .\nUser Interface:Okay . So what's the difference between\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:user interface design d industrial design ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:I mean , you have to know . Ah , you have to know it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's difficult . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's your job , so I hope you you know what it is .\nIndustrial Designer:You know very soon . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .\nUser Interface:Okay , so I make uh u user interface .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:You you de you implement the core functions in the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And i maybe you will transform it {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:I I think the user the user interface design is {disfmarker} he will design how the user will you know {disfmarker} the relation between the user and you know the remote control so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Use it . Make make {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .\nUser Interface:Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . So the materi\nUser Interface:I design the user f user interface , you design the function .\nProject Manager:Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay right . But {disfmarker} I was thinking that he's a user {disfmarker} 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But I don't know . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Well . You know .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm the industrial designer .\nMarketing:Oh , okay , okay . Not the other one .\nIndustrial Designer:So .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So and the marketing expert will {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have\nProject Manager:And {disfmarker}\nMarketing:and then thi this would {vocalsound} I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Ok Okay .\nProject Manager:And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:as everybody everybody will have to use it ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm .\nProject Manager:so really the remote control to be international .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:And not too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . And uh simple .\nProject Manager:As we want to maximise the benefit .\nUser Interface:And easy to use .\nMarketing:And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros .\nUser Interface:Ah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It should be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's the problem .\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So , is it okay ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm . It's clear .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know .\nMarketing:Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Is it ? {vocalsound} Are we supposed to do right now ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah , you try . Try first . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you think we have to do it now ?\nIndustrial Designer:I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You can draw something which is very simple . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You want me to draw something ?\nIndustrial Designer:Oh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Product manager {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Everybody {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay , let's go ,\nUser Interface:Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here .\nProject Manager:I will try .\nUser Interface:Kemy is really good at drawing . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Many {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think everybody should do it , so .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's not matter {vocalsound} So .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You're going to draw ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Uh it's the same as mine .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} What's this ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} yeah . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's a cat .\nUser Interface:It's a fat cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It is not a fat cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's the fat cat , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it is a {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Can you draw uh um rabbit ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh , hat ha rat .\nMarketing:A rat ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:That's difficult .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat .\nProject Manager:No . A mouse is not too difficult .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's your rat . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mouse is okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , it's okay .\nMarketing:Yeah . Just go ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay ,\nMarketing:you you the closest to the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer:go {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} right , but in grow , it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Jus\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:everybody has to grow {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Oh . Okay , I draw . The only thing I can draw is like this . Oh . Oh . Oh .\nMarketing:A duck .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You love the eyes .\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound} What's this ?\nIndustrial Designer:What are you {disfmarker} I don {vocalsound} no idea , so {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , that was the eyes .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:A clown .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Rabbit .\nIndustrial Designer:It's a rabbit .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Pikachu . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's a rabbit .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh yeah .

I go .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What ? Oh . So what else ? This was my favourite one ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} So you don't have a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Thank you . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} A fish .\nMarketing:Right . A fish .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's a that's a fish ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , let's try to draw something .\nProject Manager:You forgot the chips .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh yeah , doesn't look so fine .\nIndustrial Designer:Have to be really careful .\nProject Manager:Fish and chips . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Ah {vocalsound} it's my turn .\nMarketing:it's your turn .\nUser Interface:Oh . Okay , be careful .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So . {gap} {gap} It's ok\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Of\nUser Interface:No problem , no problem .\nIndustrial Designer:So , what can I draw some more ?\nProject Manager:Oh {gap} . {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} ? No . Mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's it's a se it's my priority this one .

Um so f here's our agenda for today . Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . {vocalsound} Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to {disfmarker} um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . So . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um {vocalsound} so we're gonna try out our white board . If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . Okay .\nUser Interface:So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think both . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Both . Yeah {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Okay . Why don't we do both . Right .\nMarketing:Who starts ? We ought to decide who starts and {vocalsound} all that . No ?\nProject Manager:Any volunteers ?\nMarketing:Uh-huh .\nProject Manager:Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh {disfmarker} Does it have to be {vocalsound} functional , trendy and user friendly ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um . Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Make sure {gap} my things here . Uh-oh . Right . Okay , my favourite animal is {disfmarker} see . {vocalsound} Oops .\nProject Manager:A dolphin .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'S like playing Pictionary .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah . {vocalsound} It's my dolphin .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I like its tail .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um , no , I think dolphins are really uh {disfmarker} I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} They're graceful .\nUser Interface:they're graceful yeah , and they're so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Sleek {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah they're sleek\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and they look intelligent and I don't know , they're {disfmarker} I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing .\nProject Manager:I don't know how intelligent that one looks {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah he he doesn't look that smart {vocalsound} . He's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I dunno um they're {disfmarker} I think it's cool the the um {vocalsound} the interaction that or the th things that {disfmarker} the reasons people seem to like you know {disfmarker} you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like {vocalsound} {disfmarker} but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes . {vocalsound} Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ?\nIndustrial Designer:Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-oh there goes the ten .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know . They sleep all day , {vocalsound} they're easy to draw {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Do you wanna {gap} anything ?\nMarketing:Uh yeah .\nProject Manager:I dunno if the the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think the pen is running out of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one .\nProject Manager:ah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So I'll use the spare one . Um but it's harder to draw {gap} um .\nUser Interface:And the pen's dying {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Um .\nProject Manager:A horse .\nUser Interface:Horse .\nMarketing:Uh . Um I don't {vocalsound} really know how the legs go ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's very good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but anyway I will do that . Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{gap} Yeah . This cord's {disfmarker} {gap} Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet {vocalsound} . Uh {disfmarker} It's a pig .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And furry .\nProject Manager:yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Textile {disfmarker} tactile , {vocalsound} tactile remote control .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Although {disfmarker} uh I'll just put there . Right .\nUser Interface:You're dragging a {disfmarker} you have a tail {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{gap} Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country {vocalsound} . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .\nUser Interface:Sorry can you just say that {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} what are our price goals again ?\nProject Manager:Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:How many should we sell then ? {vocalsound} Um , a lot ,\nProject Manager:Anyone a mathematician ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:two two two million , {gap} two mi no , more f four million .\nIndustrial Designer:Two million .\nMarketing:Four million . And it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It is a lot . Uh .\nProject Manager:So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .\nMarketing:Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I was thinking that too .\nMarketing:bec yeah {vocalsound} bec\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I've always wanted that ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .\nMarketing:Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Maybe call is enough . But yeah .\nUser Interface:just I mean like your phone even just has so {disfmarker} like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , or if it had a {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:like just to have a home for it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah yeah yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well that's why it's always in the couch .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Yeah , in in the couch {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah so we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the project is now couches and remote controls .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Something like that .\nProject Manager:Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?\nMarketing:And the other thing is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Bigger .\nMarketing:Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Like Hand hand held size , yeah .\nUser Interface:Hand-sized .\nMarketing:Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Not not huge , but {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know .\nUser Interface:It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .\nMarketing:No , it can't be , uh-uh .\nIndustrial Designer:No it really wouldn't be .\nProject Manager:Huh .\nUser Interface:Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Like spaceship .\nUser Interface:. Yeah {vocalsound} . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That would be really {disfmarker} I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .\nProject Manager:Little homing device . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Uh .\nProject Manager:Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes .\nMarketing:Oh dear .\nProject Manager:Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap}\nUser Interface:I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I agree .\nUser Interface:'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah yeah .\nUser Interface:I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So .\nProject Manager:You {disfmarker} what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does .\nUser Interface:That would be cool .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I mean it just seems like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So you could like um {disfmarker} like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can {disfmarker} the way you do it on your radio is that you uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:what do you call it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Select . Uh .\nProject Manager:s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s\nMarketing:But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .\nProject Manager:That's something we could decide . Mm .\nMarketing:Because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno .\nMarketing:Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:and then use the telly as a screen .\nProject Manager:Right .\nMarketing:But um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:is that what you mean ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Right . Mm .\nUser Interface:Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point {disfmarker} twelve fifty for {disfmarker} to actually make the device .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um but it's something to think about , yeah .\nUser Interface:Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Or some {disfmarker} it i we can find out probably on the internet {vocalsound} how much it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:What was the word ?\nUser Interface:Furry .\nMarketing:Water resistant .\nProject Manager:Oh I was just {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No but it's {disfmarker} I thought , ah , spot on .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Mm , mm .\nMarketing:That's quite annoying .\nProject Manager:Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:like that's another {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , clip . Ooh {vocalsound} . Um .\nProject Manager:Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think so .\nProject Manager:yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ?\nIndustrial Designer:User .\nProject Manager:Yeah , what does it stand for again ?\nUser Interface:That's me . Uh , User Interface design .\nProject Manager:User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w\nUser Interface:So technical function .\nIndustrial Designer:The working design is the structure .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um , I guess you'd have to find out {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nMarketing:It says on that email but it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It was in the email .\nUser Interface:It does but it {disfmarker} I just don't really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I wrote down what mine were .\nMarketing:It said um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:It said {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright .\nMarketing:Yeah\nUser Interface:And working design .\nMarketing:like {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Be a medium between you and the telly I think ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:that's uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And how it works , okay . Right . I'm I'm on task .\nProject Manager:And the M_E_ , what does that stand for {vocalsound} ? M\nIndustrial Designer:Marketing .\nProject Manager:Marketing , right . Um {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um .\nProject Manager:So we'll be working on the user requirements , um {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes . I just did .\n", "summary": "Project Manager invites teammates to brainstorm animal characteristics on remote control function and suggest a reflection on user experience to improve technical function design.

{"id": 12, "conversations": "Project Manager:{gap} Do you need to change anything on it ? Because otherwise I will already open it .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker} Mm , don't think so .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Unless uh things have suddenly change again .\nProject Manager:Is it much changes ?\nMarketing:Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information , {vocalsound} like uh last time .\nProject Manager:Uh I didn't {disfmarker} No no . I do hot have {disfmarker} Only the same information . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Hello , Sebastian .\nIndustrial Designer:Hello hello Mister P_M_ .\nProject Manager:I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , that's where the thinking goes on . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh , it's that Roo again , always late .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Bongiorno .\nProject Manager:Bongiorno .\nIndustrial Designer:I think you should punish him .\nProject Manager:Hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You're the P_M_ . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Punish . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I see some interesting {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay .\nUser Interface:You wish . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Possibilities , yeah ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} People , welcome back .\nUser Interface:Welcome . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:The third meeting . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oop .\nProject Manager:Um I have some points I would like to {disfmarker} uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um {vocalsound} first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so I could {disfmarker} uh can uh um use that in the in the report . {vocalsound} Um the second thing , um {vocalsound} I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . That's quite strange .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} the agenda for now {disfmarker} uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No .\nIndustrial Designer:Not at all .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um {vocalsound} I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .\nMarketing:'Kay . Hmm ?\nUser Interface:Alright .\nMarketing:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Just press the okay button , it works .\nMarketing:Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} Okay .\nProject Manager:Um yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah . My method ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} How surprising . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , findings . Uh {disfmarker} Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes {gap} uh m material . But we {disfmarker} since we are concentrating on uh the younger group {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh w wait a sec wait a se\nIndustrial Designer:Oh wait uh wait up .\nProject Manager:uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah {gap} okay . The feel of {gap} to be spongy {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?\nMarketing:Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Not something dull .\nUser Interface:But they like dark colours ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:you said in the p\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .\nUser Interface:Okay . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I had {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But can you can you go back to that slide ? The {disfmarker} uh\nMarketing:Which one ?\nIndustrial Designer:just one slide back ,\nMarketing:This ?\nIndustrial Designer:no no no . Yes . Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh well , it might .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But {disfmarker} Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .\nProject Manager:Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it {disfmarker} maybe it rubber or or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , exactly .\nProject Manager:yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials ,\nUser Interface:Or we could make {disfmarker} oh .\nMarketing:but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .\nProject Manager:Well , that's interesting .\nIndustrial Designer:It's quite interesting . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .\nUser Interface:Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh {vocalsound} telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:It's the it's the rubber uh cover .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .\nUser Interface:And it's uh colourful .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It looks likes a banana . {vocalsound} We have the fruit , we have the colours . {vocalsound} We have the simple design .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Do you know the phone ?\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know the phone ,\nProject Manager:It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,\nIndustrial Designer:but I can imagine it .\nProject Manager:I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,\nUser Interface:Um thirty five .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , that one , yes .\nProject Manager:the very {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And the b the light blue and {vocalsound} it's also in yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:Now I kn uh {disfmarker} oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .\nProject Manager:You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th\nMarketing:I've seen it ,\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay . Um uh\nMarketing:but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:okay . Do you have {gap} {disfmarker} uh thit {disfmarker} that was {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Kay . Uh that's about it .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the {disfmarker} our target group .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .\nMarketing:Uh soft material .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?\nMarketing:Uh the fancy look and feel .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .\nMarketing:Yes . Apparently .\nProject Manager:Okay , Roo ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:could you do your presentation ?\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and {vocalsound} just um , well , a weird um shape .\nProject Manager:Shape .\nUser Interface:So I suggest {disfmarker} I couldn't uh {disfmarker} I had a small uh mock-up uh {vocalsound} sign on the {vocalsound} on {gap} paper .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple {vocalsound} f uh a shape on uh {disfmarker} in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,\nIndustrial Designer:Slippery .\nProject Manager:s because um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:You have to grab it .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah , exactly .\nUser Interface:So it's easy in your hand {disfmarker} Uh indeed .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .\nProject Manager:Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So m Yes .\nProject Manager:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .\nProject Manager:Okay , good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Great . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:So if you have the voice recognition , you can {vocalsound} you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , b but I think we'll {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Right .\nIndustrial Designer:But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . {vocalsound} Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You really have to imagine like {vocalsound} winding up your {disfmarker} uh\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , it would be very new to the market ,\nIndustrial Designer:I d\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It would be very new ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're {disfmarker} you you have to um make some kind of energy {disfmarker} kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .\nUser Interface:Like the watch .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It have {disfmarker} it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .\nProject Manager:I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed .\nProject Manager:I mean solar is {disfmarker} of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Indeed .\nProject Manager:Um hand dynamo {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , maybe m\nUser Interface:if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I know .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yes .\nUser Interface:You you walk\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and uh {disfmarker} but uh you {disfmarker} you're sitting on a couch .\nIndustrial Designer:But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . {gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . And wha\nIndustrial Designer:well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .\nProject Manager:Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yes , it does .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll come to that later .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . {vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um {vocalsound} uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yes . That is possible too . Yes .\nUser Interface:{gap} {disfmarker} But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels {disfmarker} I had some {disfmarker} I had some information about it too .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:I don't think {vocalsound} there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .\nProject Manager:This will be the remote , right ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh it's do it's done before .\nProject Manager:Because this is how you keep it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .\nUser Interface:But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Volume ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , it's it {disfmarker} well , i what he means is there's an {disfmarker} button integrated in the scroll-wheel .\nUser Interface:A volume , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .\nProject Manager:Well , what about mute ?\nIndustrial Designer:About mute .\nProject Manager:Thi i i m I guess uh th\nIndustrial Designer:Well , yes .\nProject Manager:this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .\nProject Manager:And click it to muten the device .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , okay . It's quite goods .\nProject Manager:And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yes .\nProject Manager:So maybe um {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} that's something you two uh need to think about .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well ,\nUser Interface:Wheel .\nMarketing:it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . {vocalsound} But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker} Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .\nProject Manager:Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe it's not no {gap} .\nProject Manager:Nokia has a {disfmarker} well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It doesn't use a {disfmarker} {gap} . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:For you too , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .\nIndustrial Designer:Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .\nUser Interface:So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {gap} yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . Sebastian . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:There's {disfmarker} there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation . {vocalsound} About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah yeah , you can um {disfmarker} I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function\nIndustrial Designer:okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:and then it's um {disfmarker} well , I believe it's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It performs the action . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So you say mute , he repeats mute and you {disfmarker} makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh well {disfmarker} uh\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:d did we already decide on the display ? To {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well , I don't have um {disfmarker} I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information {disfmarker} uh y I don't think you need it on a display .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I I don't think either .\nUser Interface:'cause uh {gap} uh all {disfmarker} any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,\nIndustrial Designer:No . I don't think you need it .\nProject Manager:On screen display . Yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay , well\nProject Manager:th\nIndustrial Designer:my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .\nProject Manager:Okay . Good .\nIndustrial Designer:So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Kineti okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .\nProject Manager:Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,\nIndustrial Designer:Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,\nProject Manager:too {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:uh well .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's {disfmarker} in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} Yes . And I think it's more robust .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:It's more uh Uh it's more functional .\nUser Interface:But what about um the markets {vocalsound} uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No no , but the uh um {disfmarker} that's what Sebastian said .\nIndustrial Designer:The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different .\nUser Interface:Okay . Oh ,\nProject Manager:So um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:sorry . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and we should uh use wood or something like that .\nProject Manager:No ,\nUser Interface:And I would think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And\nProject Manager:r\nMarketing:yeah ,\nProject Manager:rubber with colours .\nMarketing:the {disfmarker} yeah , the older people liked wood .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .\nMarketing:No the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Colourful and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , spongy materials .\nMarketing:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .\nUser Interface:And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay , but we also {disfmarker} uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh {disfmarker} a different {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:oh ,\nProject Manager:But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,\nUser Interface:evalu\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .\nProject Manager:I it's too dull . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think c our customers will like it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot {disfmarker} um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So I think this is the best of two worlds .\nProject Manager:Okay , what about um {vocalsound} the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . It's it's {disfmarker} uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's very unlogical .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well the there has to be some pointing at . But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It depends also on your on your {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just {vocalsound} to the other wall .\nProject Manager:Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably {disfmarker} you're probably right .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um {disfmarker} yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .\nIndustrial Designer:All lights get absorbed , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So {vocalsound} it has an {disfmarker} it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .\nUser Interface:And the regular chip .\nIndustrial Designer:I think uh it gives us the advantage of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , yes .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I like the scroll wheels uh idea .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh skip {disfmarker} and skip the L_C_D_ part .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think it it's any uh value added thing .\nUser Interface:No . Think so too .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , it looks {disfmarker} uh yeah , well um\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,\nIndustrial Designer:Technology .\nProject Manager:and I mean L_C_D_ is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . It's not very flashy and new .\nProject Manager:well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard\nMarketing:Standard ?\nProject Manager:than than {disfmarker} Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .\nProject Manager:Mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I think our customers will go insane .\nProject Manager:Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's it's too much .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M\nProject Manager:No ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ? {gap} Roo , do you have any other {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Um no . Nothing more .\nProject Manager:Nothing more . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Uh the n the next phase will be um the um {disfmarker} not the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Sebas\nIndustrial Designer:what is the next phase {gap} f Flores ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well , we we {vocalsound} need to describe uh decisions now .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So um\nIndustrial Designer:So i\nProject Manager:on the energy , well , we decided .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Chip .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , okay .\nProject Manager:User interface um\nUser Interface:Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , they can work .\nUser Interface:Sorry , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:They cannot work with double-curved .\nUser Interface:Oh , sorry . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's that's problem . I'll check it for you .\nProject Manager:Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The project drawing is for the next {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's it's uh {disfmarker} when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .\nUser Interface:Yeah , right .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?\nProject Manager:Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll do .\nProject Manager:Great . Um {disfmarker} Uh you you need to help me . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . W start with the casing .\nProject Manager:The casing is curved , single-curved .\nUser Interface:Single-curved .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ?\nProject Manager:Traditional batteries uh and solar .\nUser Interface:But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ?\nProject Manager:No ,\nUser Interface:'Cause if we have to choose {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:they can be complementary . Uh al al I uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:I I think they can . Yes .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Every device {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What if not ?\nIndustrial Designer:It it should be . There should be really no problem .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:They can be supplementary . That's no problem .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , um\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:th\nIndustrial Designer:So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar .\nProject Manager:Battery and solar , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , with colourful rubber .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . {gap} uh black and yellow .\nProject Manager:Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Grey and yellow .\nIndustrial Designer:Grey yellow , okay .\nUser Interface:Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , I think it's uh {disfmarker} it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?\nProject Manager:Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .\nUser Interface:I believe the {disfmarker} But you have already um {disfmarker} you must have a red uh on and off button . And um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well , it it doesn't have to be red . Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:or or {disfmarker} I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Or black and yellow .\nProject Manager:Black and yellow , yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , there is . {vocalsound} Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , I've read .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:with {gap} and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Yes ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} No .\nIndustrial Designer:but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .\nProject Manager:Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} So I'm afraid it's not possible .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:A scroll-wheel .\nProject Manager:The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .\nUser Interface:Voice recognition , of course .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And th the {disfmarker} they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .\nProject Manager:Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:What what did you say ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well uh you can use {disfmarker} well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So it has th the spongy uh feel also .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i\nUser Interface:Yeah , b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .\nProject Manager:{gap} .\nUser Interface:What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .\nProject Manager:Uh is that {disfmarker} uh does our our supplier say so ?\nUser Interface:It is not uh something uh {disfmarker} it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh didn't {disfmarker} did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?\nUser Interface:No , but but uh it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .\nProject Manager:Yeah . You could place a {disfmarker} um uh this this would be the button .\nMarketing:There {disfmarker} the icons .\nProject Manager:The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place the indica th th the signals the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , b yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's possible ,\nIndustrial Designer:That's okay .\nMarketing:So you don't touch the icons that much .\nUser Interface:but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .\nProject Manager:No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or {disfmarker} But it's into the rubber .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but this is on the pla\nUser Interface:You have to draw the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , the signs .\nProject Manager:yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh {disfmarker} You just move the problem .\nProject Manager:What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?\nIndustrial Designer:Uh I see what you mean . Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I'm I'm not so sure ,\nUser Interface:Y uh can you separate these uh these {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think both .\nProject Manager:I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .\nUser Interface:I do . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I do .\nUser Interface:Or the s uh the sideways .\nIndustrial Designer:I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Or the the back . Or the back .\nProject Manager:Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the {disfmarker} these buttons ?\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker} Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or {disfmarker} i you play with it .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:um because you have to make its prototype , and um {disfmarker} yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:so I'm going to leave it {disfmarker} the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um not quite . Um what about uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ?\nUser Interface:Regular .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Use with {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker} no , I think that's about it . Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all .\nProject Manager:Okay , well .\nIndustrial Designer:And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished . Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} . For the finishing touch .\nProject Manager:Yeah ? Yeah , um if you write {disfmarker} wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:Uh yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But um Sebastian has everything .\nProject Manager:I know , but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll put it online .\nProject Manager:Great . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Right .\n", "summary": "This is the third meeting of the design group. At first, Marketing revealed that ease of use, innovation and a fancy look and feel could be important to customers and the team discussed what colour and material they should use. Then Industrial Designer introduced three casing possibilities: uncurved, single-curved and double-curved. Next, the team talked about whether to use kinetic energy supply as an energy source. In terms of user interface controls, Industrial Designer proposed to add a scroll-wheel that could be integrated with buttons. Finally, the team summed up their decisions and Project Manager asked User Interface Designer to create a prototype next.", "length": 13746},
{"id": 13, "conversations": "Lynne Neagle AM:Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and there is no substitute. Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2, then, is a further evidence session, number four, on our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Dafydd Evans, who is chair, ColegauCymru, and chief executive officer of Grŵp Llandrillo Menai; Kay Martin, principal of Cardiff and Vale College, also representing ColegauCymru; Nick Brazil, who is deputy principal, Gower College Swansea, also representing ColegauCymru; Dr Rachel Bowen, director of policy and development at ColegauCymru; and Ed Evans, who is the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association. Thank you all for attending. We're very pleased that you've been able to join us. If it's okay with you, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Siân Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Good morning. I'll be asking my questions in Welsh.\nDafydd Evans:Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. We've possibly chosen this panel because there are differences of opinion. So, I just want to give you that context at the outset. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I think the skills challenge certificate is a better title, and is something that people understand a lot better than the Welsh bac. So, no, I don't think that employers understand the value or what we're trying to achieve through the Welsh bac at present.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Which is a big problem.\nDafydd Evans:Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course.\nDr Rachel Bowen:And I think that that varies by size of employer as well. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. But we know that most employers in Wales are small or microbusinesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine.\nNick Brazil:Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly meet with—employers—and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require—the Welsh bac—to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within those professional sectors. Not many of them have indicated that the Welsh bac is providing the skills that they require. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac initially, but the Welsh bac has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand the Welsh bac. They certainly don't mention the Welsh bac and, as I said, are very much questioning the qualifications that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Kay, is that your experience?\nKay Martin:Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications. But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. And that isn't captured necessarily in the Welsh baccalaureate. And, so, the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Okay. And, finally, I know you've got strong views as an organisation.\nEd Evans:Do you mind if I carry on in English—\nSian Gwenllian AM:Fine.\nEd Evans:—just so that a lot of our members will understand when I'm speaking. I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. For my sector in particular—the civil engineering sector—and particularly the contracting sector, which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to—. And I think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this, and supporting schools and colleges to deliver it, they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry. And some children, some pupils, some young people, they respond far, far better to that. And I think that's the issue for me—that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would be true of a lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate.\nSian Gwenllian AM:What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course?\nDafydd Evans:I think we need to review the qualification, and I think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within that qualification. And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications board, I think the employers—. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate—that it was going to improve skills for employment. But, somehow or other we've lost our way. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help.\nEd Evans:I will carry on in English, if that's okay.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes, it's no problem.\nEd Evans:I would agree. I think we do need more employers involved in this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. It happens at the moment. It's the community benefits clauses that are in construction contracts. They're there to serve a really good purpose, but it's become a little bit piecemeal and a little bit tokenistic, whereas the Welsh bac offers an opportunity—. It's something that's part of the curriculum. It's clearly not functioning well at the moment. It would benefit from that business input. So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit—we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it.\nKay Martin:Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days—they go for six-week internships. Some learners have got real benefit from that and really raised their aspirations. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world. So, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college.\nSian Gwenllian AM:So, do we get rid of it?\nLynne Neagle AM:You don't need to answer that. [Laughter.]\nSian Gwenllian AM:I mean, if there are so many other programmes helping anyway, why do we need it?\nNick Brazil:I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac—I think when we go back a number of years—was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. And that's what happens, unfortunately. But I think what Ed said is absolutely right: if you get the engagement of the employers—. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. The actual progress of learners into employment is happening. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. The vision was a good one.\nDafydd Evans:I'd like to expand on what Nick said. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that.\nLynne Neagle AM:Suzy, you've got a supplementary.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills. However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools—well, and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it. So, thank you for that. Diolch.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Have you finished? Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. Good morning. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective—.\nDafydd Evans:I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs—in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a C grade in the core subjects. But that eats into the time that we have to teach young people. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow—no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. So, the priorities, I think, across the sector—. We've given priority to GCSE resits rather than doing the Welsh bac at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Okay. Thank you.\nNick Brazil:Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification—it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac—for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well—that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes—and we all get funded on the outcomes—that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. So, I think people lose the fact that the Welsh bac is a combination of things. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh—I thought that's something that we need to think about.\nKay Martin:If I could just say as well, our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people, and we use every tool in our box to do that. And, as I said earlier, there are lots of things that we do. The Welsh bac, where it works really well, does help prepare them, I think, for employment, but it's not for everyone, because some people have to do the other things. Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels, even in a vocational programme, it's too big for them. As you say, they're coming from schools, some of them with very few GCSEs, or they haven't got literacy and numeracy skills, they're being tested and many of them are below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy. So, I think it needs to be reviewed, to look at how we could make skilled and employable people. It helps prepare some people—the A-level students for university—but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you.\nDr Rachel Bowen:And this, ultimately, has to be about what's in the best interests of learners, and a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Thank you. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study.\nDafydd Evans:That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way—\nKay Martin:Great advocates.\nDafydd Evans:—and great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then—'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well.\nKay Martin:Many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges, but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac—normally.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Okay. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals?\nNick Brazil:Yes.\nKay Martin:Yes.\nDafydd Evans:Yes.\nDr Rachel Bowen:Yes.\nEd Evans:Yes.\nNick Brazil:I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us—certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners—that a number of them have come from school and probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do—think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels.\nDr Rachel Bowen:And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM:Okay. A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac?\nKay Martin:Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities. They do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade. I talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a Russell Group university because she had the Welsh bac as well, but it was a very paper-based exercise. But I think it is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities. In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here—University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University—value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when our students go to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when our learners go to USW. It is valued by them and they accept it, but when people go further afield—and we're always trying to push our learners beyond. Where they can afford to go away to university, we encourage that. But some of the universities are not valuing the Welsh baccalaureate.\nLynne Neagle AM:Did you have a supplementary, Siân?\nSian Gwenllian AM:Yes. You didn't mention Cardiff University there.\nKay Martin:Cardiff University—yes. My daughter's example—that was Cardiff University. So, they do, especially now it's graded at level 3. Then they do accept it. A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely.\nNick Brazil:Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. So, obviously, we've had that track record. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities, the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. So, I think we need to consider that. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject.\nLynne Neagle AM:Siân.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Maybe Dafydd can give us the picture from north Wales.\nDafydd Evans:I mentioned before coming in, in terms of the context—. Because of the nature of our catchment area, there is a greater percentage of our students staying in Welsh universities, and, as Kay said, Welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac. So, to a certain extent, it is less of a problem. But, naturally, we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group, and we're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities.\nSian Gwenllian AM:But in terms of Bangor and Glyndŵr University, there's no problem there, though.\nDafydd Evans:No, there is no problem there.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. Right, the next questions are from Julie Morgan.\nJulie Morgan AM:Thank you, Chair. Good morning. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that.\nDafydd Evans:Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. Actually, it's probably larger than an A-level by now. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up to a Russell university's expectations, and on the other hand, it's trying to develop softer skills and employment skills for people going into work from a vocational area. Can the same product deliver those two outcomes? I'm certainly not sure, and perhaps we need to think: what are we trying to achieve with this qualification?\nJulie Morgan AM:Right.\nKay Martin:Yes, and earlier, we talked as well about that difference for the A-level students. They know what it is. It's worth UCAS points. For the vocational students, some things like the Career Ready programme, which is used in other colleges, and WorldSkills, you know, where all colleges have really been pushing to get more learners into WorldSkills at national and international level. And for some of our learners, particularly if we take our engineering learners, then having somebody who has competed in Europe as a tiler or an electrician would, I think, make an employer think, 'I'd better look at this person', whereas the other one has done the Welsh bac—. I think they would look at the WorldSkills person first. And the investment we have to put into WorldSkills is huge. So, for some of our learners, we choose that you do WorldSkills, because that is going to be more valuable for you as a skill, and to show to an employer how much extra time you've put in. So, they put a lot of time—you know, to get somebody into a WorldSkills competition is not just a couple of hours a week, it isn't just the normal curriculum—they have extra time. They are more able and talented vocational learners, and that is more valuable to those learners and I think it's more valid for employers than the Welsh baccalaureate.\nNick Brazil:I think it's got to, extending on what Kay says—. It's got to be—. You know, it is comparable, as long as it's right for that learner's future. If it's right for the learner's future, absolutely it's comparable. But if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the Welsh bac is not accepted, it's not comparable. But, then, if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector, absolutely. But it's got to be right for the learner.\nJulie Morgan AM:What are the reasons why some colleges do see it as being rigorous and others don't? Why does the view vary?\nEd Evans:Can I give perhaps an employer's perspective on that, which might be completely wrong, but it's been interesting listening to what's been said here? About a year ago, we bought the WJEC in to speak to our employers, or a number of them, just to explain to them what the Welsh bac was about—back to listening and about understanding, really, and it just was not there at all. I could see that most of the employers there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels. We've kind of gone into an university discussion here, but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. The skills that they bring having gone through this process I think most of the employers could get, at least in my sector, they could understand—'I can see what that person can do.' But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. They are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway. So, for me, the Welsh bac helps to build that. Call it something else maybe, but that's what it should do.\nJulie Morgan AM:Right. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there.\nKay Martin:It probably depends on the subjects that people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac—even if they're not doing that. So, it does depend on the subject, I think.\nDafydd Evans:I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac in terms of—I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process. Certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it very rewarding. So, there are some very positive things coming out there. I think what we're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it's about.\nNick Brazil:On this point about the skills being developed, I think that's debatable if all the skills that are supposed to be developed in the Welsh bac are being developed, and that's why I think there's a need to relook at it to make sure those skills are being developed fully. But I will go back to the point that I think a comparable qualification is comparable as long as it achieves the right outcome for that particular learner. If you force a learner to do something that is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that they require in their future, is it the right thing to be doing for that learner? That's what my concern is.\nDr Rachel Bowen:I think the baccalaureate approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance. That whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we've discussed, that's a real positive. The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. The approach is a positive one.\nLynne Neagle AM:Suzy, you had a supplementary.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes, to both Rachel Bowen and Nick Brazil, if you don't mind. Both of you mentioned this is about skills and a piece of paper that demonstrates that you have these skills. At pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have? The reason I'm asking this question, having had children who've gone through the process myself, is that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that undermines the whole idea of the bac anyway. It's just not fair on the learners or the people teaching the bac. Is that a fair observation?\nDr Rachel Bowen:I think it's perfectly possible for learners to reach FE college having attained the Welsh bac under the process that you've described, and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see.\nNick Brazil:Yes, and at interview process or during an interview, or in the first week, you can see that they haven't developed those skills, and I think it is down to the variable models that have been put in place. There are lots of different models, and if you put, as I said, the model that you've described in place, there is no way, in that period of time, you're going to develop those skills. But that indicates, again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes. It might be different post 16—I accept that. Okay. Thank you.\nDr Rachel Bowen:And obviously practice will differ across schools.\nLynne Neagle AM:Julie, did you have any more questions?\nJulie Morgan AM:No, I've finished, thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:We've got some questions now then, from Suzy, on universal adoption.\nSuzy Davies AM:Well, I'm wondering if I need to ask them, really, because I think I'm getting a strong sense that you all think that universal adoption is a bad idea at this moment in time. However, I do want to test something, because we have had witnesses who say that it would be a good idea because it reduces the amount of competition and advantage that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally adopted, it would remove an artificial choice, basically, for learners, i.e. they were losing Welsh-speaking students who didn't want to do the bac to English-speaking institutions. So, I wonder if you could tell me how much the decision in your individual colleges not to offer bac is down to the opportunity that it presents you to attract students, particularly from sixth forms, where students may be obliged to do the bac.\nKay Martin:That is not the case, I would say. When a learner comes to us, we—. I'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner. In some cases, it's to go back to school, and we absolutely say, 'You need to go back to school.' If somebody comes from a Welsh-medium school, then usually I will speak to the head and make sure that we have a programme in place, that either they're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of Welsh, or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their Welsh language skills. We don't say, 'Come to us and you don't have to do the Welsh bac,' because if they do A-levels, we say it's compulsory, unless you're in the Seren group.\nSuzy Davies AM:Yes. Well, that's the point; it's about English-speaking students, not just Welsh—.\nKay Martin:No, it isn't used. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac in many cases. So, we wouldn't deliberately—. I mean, if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell people, 'Come on in and you won't have to do it.'\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay, can I run that across you all, in an outburst of honesty?\nDafydd Evans:Yes, absolutely. We universally adopt at level 3, but we don't at levels 1 and 2.\nSuzy Davies AM:Oh, yes, for the reasons you've given in the evidence, actually.\nDafydd Evans:Yes, but across the whole of level 3, A-level and vocational, the Welsh bac is an integral part of the curriculum, and it isn't an option for the student to opt out.\nLynne Neagle AM:Do you let your Seren students opt out like they do in Cardiff and the Vale, or do they have to do it as well?\nDafydd Evans:We've forced—. No, sorry, 'forced' is not the word. [Laughter.] We have encouraged and persuaded everybody to do it.\nSuzy Davies AM:So, that will be four A-levels plus bac.\nDafydd Evans:Yes.\nNick Brazil:I've got to be honest, at present, with our college, we do not ask. It's compulsory for A-level students to do the Welsh bac. It's an option of one of our choices—we have a large choice—and I think it comes back to that fact that we're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions. I think it's something we all need to consider across the nation, that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future. I will go back to the point I made earlier—everything's comparable as long as it's the right thing for the learner's future, and I genuinely believe, and I'm sure a lot of colleagues believe, that that choice element is important to a learner, okay. If it is the right choice and if the Welsh bac is the right choice, that is correct, and we move that along. Obviously, we debated about where there are elements that need to change. But you've got to be doing the right things for the learner, and we are certainly not selling it, 'Come to us; you don't do the Welsh bac.' It is part of what we offer. It is part of what the college's curriculum offers—there is no doubt about that—and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future.\nSuzy Davies AM:Okay, thank you. I've just got one question for Mr Ed Evans, if that's okay. You explained earlier that if people knew what the bac was about in your sector, they'd value it more greatly, which I accept. Are you worried at all, though, that some of the more able and talented STEM students, in particular—who are needed in your sector, after all—might be deterred from doing those four A-levels because of the bac, because, presumably, you need a mix of these talents? You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners—presumably you need them all.\nEd Evans:We do. There's a big range, and some really high achievers coming into the sector as well. So, it is about that mix. I think the discussion that I've had with our employers has been around the academic side of things, if you like. The qualifications are well catered for. So, it's almost a given somebody's been through that route. What isn't there is some of those softer skills, but also some—. I was almost going to call commercial skills 'soft' there—.\nSuzy Davies AM:Call them 'commercial'.\nEd Evans:Commercial skills are hard skills, which are very, very difficult to come by. So, the Welsh bac starts to do some of those things at different levels. Again, I'll come back to the input of businesses to support that delivery of commercial skills and so on, but I think I probably made that point earlier. So, I don't think it is a case of squeezing things out. There's clearly going to be different individuals who will cope better, and they will be, I guess, maybe guided as well by parents to a certain degree in terms of, 'You do those four and forget about that nonsense there', which is not helpful, but I can understand why that happens. So, for me, now, it's not a case of squeezing—. This should be seen as an important part of creating a rounded individual ready for employment. I guess that's what a lot of our employers saw the Welsh bac as being able to do. Whether that's a shared view is another matter.\nSuzy Davies AM:That's great. Thank you.\nNick Brazil:Can I just add something to that? I think Ed's just said about the softer skills. Do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification? I think Kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college. We run programmes as well. They're not qualifications, but they offer the opportunity to develop those softer skills. So, I think we're all in agreement about the development of the skills, but does it need to be through a qualification?\nLynne Neagle AM:And you've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner. Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools?\nNick Brazil:As I said, in terms of our offer, we offer a range in the curriculum. We're not going out there saying, 'Come to us for this particular reason.'\nLynne Neagle AM:No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come here because I don't have to do the Welsh bac'?\nNick Brazil:The honest answer is it's one of the first questions that people always ask. But, as I've said, as a parent, I've been to open evenings and other open evenings. It's generally a question that people ask, 'Do I have to do the Welsh bac?' It does come across not just in our open evenings, but in other open evenings that I've been to. It is always a question that people ask me. They do want to know that, and it's usually, as I said, one of the first questions that they ask.\nSian Gwenllian AM:And is that the parents asking the question or the pupil?\nNick Brazil:It's a combination. But, honest answer, I would say parents, a lot of the time, but the learners usually—as I said—have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that's why they ask the question straight away.\nSian Gwenllian AM:Can I suggest that maybe, then, the perception that parents have is steering the way rather than the actual benefits for the pupil in your institution? If you're telling them, 'Come to us, you don't have to actually do it because we know you don't like it', is that the correct way of approaching education?\nNick Brazil:No. Education is about offering the range and offering it correctly.\nSian Gwenllian AM:I'm being devil's advocate.\nNick Brazil:Yes, I know, I totally understand, but it's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If you don't offer the full range, which, sometimes—if you, obviously, limit and you make qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well. So, I think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra—Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.'\nSian Gwenllian AM:But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time—and parents—they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we did—. I know what this is about', and it all makes sense at that point. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Well, we'll move on now then to—.\nSian Gwenllian AM:That's a question.\nLynne Neagle AM:You do want an answer. Anybody want to pick that up?\nDafydd Evans:We certainly have experience of that, of young people coming in with quite a negative attitude, originally, to the Welsh bac and taking it on board. But where we are delivering it well, well contextualised, they've really enjoyed the experience, and very much valued the experience. So, yes, there are certainly instances of that happening, there's no doubt.\nEd Evans:We certainly see it, as employers. The penny drops after a few weeks or months.\nDafydd Evans:But don't underestimate the fact that if you had a poor experience of the Welsh bac at school, that perception is very difficult for us, as institutions, then, to change. Very difficult.\nDr Rachel Bowen:It does make it into quite an intensive selling process for colleges when they've got to overcome that negative perception. As people have said already, it is possible to talk parents and learners round, but then that's time spent having to do that selling job when we should be talking about other things.\nKay Martin:Can I just mention as well that there's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not A-levels? Perhaps you might want to do an engineering BTEC programme, or you might want to do a health and social care, or you might want to do hospitality. You might want to do BTEC programmes, you can still go to university if that's what you want to do, or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards, and selling that whole range to parents, because there is an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels—.\nLynne Neagle AM:Thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM:Thank you, Chair. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that?\nDafydd Evans:I'm not assured in terms of—yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside—'Welsh bac specialists' in inverted commas—it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and we've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac—. It's been an intensive staff development process.\nNick Brazil:And I think you've got to bear in mind that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that are done within the Welsh bac are done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. So, a number of those staff have already got those skills and they're undertaking that. I suppose when it comes to the word 'credibility' used in terms of the qualification, yes, I'm sure it would raise that focus on it, but ultimately, it's taking away from the fact that we have got staff who've got those skills and they're developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they're doing. Something we were talking about earlier on is the fact is that, sometimes, that work is being repeated twice, because of the nature of the qualification.\nDawn Bowden AM:And have you got dedicated time? Because one of the things we picked up from schools was that teachers in particular were kind of fitting it in with other lessons, and therefore, it wasn't being, again, given the same perceived level of importance as doing A-levels were. But your lecturers would all have dedicated time to deliver—\nKay Martin:On their timetables, yes. And as you say, industry specialists delivering some of those things put them more into context.\nEd Evans:I was just going to add there, really, if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular, if you've got that far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this—. Apologies, I'd almost forgotten that we were in the Colegau thing, I was thinking 'schools' actually [Laughter.] But in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way, not an ad-hoc way, which is just a friend turning up to talk about something, a structured way—. We have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum' in the sector that we hope to roll out. Now, if that was rolled out across the board—I'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular, but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled, global areas, because it's not their bag. So, bring in some experts, bring in some business, raise the profile, and I think then, possibly, you'll start to get parents thinking, 'Actually, there is something more to this than just the academic bit.'\nDawn Bowden AM:Okay. I think all my other points have been answered, Chair. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay. Can I just ask—? You've all got slightly different policies; they don't have to do it in Swansea, in Cardiff and the Vale, they do unless they're in the Seren network, and in your college, everybody does it, even if they're doing four A-levels. Do you think that's a satisfactory situation, and are you satisfied with the communication and the guidance and the steer that everyone's getting from Welsh Government on this? Because we're meant to have a policy of universal adoption, but that doesn't really seem to be happening on the ground.\nKay Martin:And I think, if you'd asked us a few years ago, we were all heading for universal adoption, but because the Welsh bac has changed into something that isn't 100 per cent what we think it should be, then we've stopped the universal adoption, if you like. So, we are trying to do what's in the best interests of the learner, but I think, as you said, we've mentioned some other programmes, and if we could look at—. We've got industry experts in colleges. We've got industry experts that are brought into colleges as well, some more than others, to bring that to life, if you like. We've got mentorship programmes, we send people out, and we just need to incorporate that better. We need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise. By the time you've done all the paperwork you haven't got time to do any of the learning.\nNick Brazil:I think, just to support Kay, we're going to need to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bac, which all of us would buy into 100 per cent. I think that has been lost as the qualification's developed over time, and, ultimately, I think all of us would like to see it go back to that to provide those skills that Ed has brought up and everything. I think we all support that. But is it quite right? I'm not sure at the moment.\nDafydd Evans:I'll agree. We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac is currently. Therefore, I think what we're saying is, if we're going universal adoption, it can't be with this product. This product isn't the product to universally adopt.\nLynne Neagle AM:Okay, that's interesting. Okay. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering our questions? It's been a very informative and interesting discussion. We will, as usual, send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your time this morning. Okay, item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, paper to note 2 is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales on home education, and paper to note 3 is the letter that the Cabinet Secretary for Education has sent to us in reply to our letter about free school meals. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then: can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Yes.\n", "summary": "This meeting was a Children, Young People and Education Committee, and it was conducted in a question and answer format regarding the inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. They had discussions on whether employers understood the meaning of the Welsh bac and how to actually improve the employer's understanding of the Welsh bac. Then they gave some answers regarding how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare learners for employment. In addition, they had discussions on whether there was a difference in how the Welsh bac was valued by learners at the different levels that it was studied, and to what extent that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac. They also talked about how comparable the Welsh bac was to other qualifications. Then they discussed the idea of universal adoption. Last but not least, they shared some opinions on the necessity of introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification.", "length": 13445},

Okay . So\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that's my name , {gap} . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to {disfmarker} uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . So um the {gap} thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things {disfmarker} or , not yet ,\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly {gap} that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it {disfmarker} that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for {disfmarker} what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} uh no , this is a {disfmarker} these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw {disfmarker} you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .\nMarketing:Folder ,\nProject Manager:Folder , okay .\nMarketing:yes .\nProject Manager:So no okay {gap} have a look at that one . Okay . So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read . {vocalsound} You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:and um and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have {disfmarker} this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . Yes ?\nMarketing:Ah I can see it now .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:This a new page , it's okay . Use pen format . and a different colour can use here {gap} no I just take the pink . You take {disfmarker} oh there's no pink , okay , oh just purple , okay .\nUser Interface:Purple .\nProject Manager:No blue . And uh line width {vocalsound} ten . Okay uh just take {disfmarker} what I'm going to draw is an elephant . Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . It's a very nice elephant , you can see . I dunno what it looks {disfmarker} but it doesn't matter . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Looks very nice .\nProject Manager:I just h\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Something like this ?

Whatever , just . You erased this one . It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . Just don't\nMarketing:Let me try one .\nProject Manager:um {disfmarker} yeah , just u use it like that , yeah . That's okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:Mm . Okay and then uh what's the colour ? How do I do {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's in format . Yeah .\nMarketing:Ah . I'll take this one . Uh there has to be water ,\nProject Manager:Just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No it has to be an animal , so if that's it's {disfmarker} it should be a shna snake or something .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The water is important . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:So I first uh draw the water .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh . Okay , and now I make the animal . It's a fish .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Wow .\nProject Manager:cool .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . So . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:This is a worm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Hmm yeah , that's nice .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Wow .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , who next ? Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh do you have to write down why {disfmarker} uh that doesn't matter , just {disfmarker} it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Just make a new blank new blank page .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Well Paul ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Like this ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , not too far to the to the t pen top .\nUser Interface:Okay . Um\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:let's make it um a dog . Ooh .\nProject Manager:Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that {disfmarker} no , to the {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} Ah okay .\nMarketing:I think it's a pig .\nUser Interface:A pig ?\nProject Manager:No , it's a dog . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I can make {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Or a dog .\nUser Interface:a dog .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:A sheep ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh we d only have twenty five minutes , so {gap} . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Take it easy .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:'Kay , I make a cat of it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I I was gonna make a cat too .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Use your fantasy . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh , not too quick .\nProject Manager:Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have {gap}\nUser Interface:No\nProject Manager:okay .\nUser Interface:I have it . I just draw too quick I think . Okay , that's it . More .\nProject Manager:No , that's okay , thank you . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's just to get used to it .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:I thought these pens would be just um {disfmarker} uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No , not yet , okay .\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's right ,\nProject Manager:But it's just {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it {disfmarker} but you actually got to write on the paper .\nProject Manager:Sorry ?\nUser Interface:You really got to write on that paper .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word ,\nMarketing:Yeah yeah , it's a real pen .\nProject Manager:so that's not\nUser Interface:Yeah , but it's just a picture .\nProject Manager:just {disfmarker} it's just a picture . So {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:it's not that cool as I th thought it would be .\nUser Interface:You really {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Y you can you can't edit in the {disfmarker} edit it in Word .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:No .\nMarketing:Oh , okay .\nUser Interface:It's a donkey .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure .\nUser Interface:Uh I think it was uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Half past .\nMarketing:Half past ten .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Brilliant .\nProject Manager:Okay , perfect .\nIndustrial Designer:Nice , eh ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Yeah , thank you . Now we just have to save everything , so . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:this is definitely the best one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh .\nProject Manager:Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Excuse me .\nProject Manager:that's {gap} . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,\nUser Interface:Piece of cake .\nProject Manager:sorry .\nUser Interface:Uh easy .\nProject Manager:So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have {gap} a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the {gap} and everything , so just have a look how it {disfmarker} we think about remote controls .\nMarketing:Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a {vocalsound} a universal remote control ?\nProject Manager:Oh yeah , that's a good question .\nMarketing:Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .\nProject Manager:I think it's {disfmarker} I'm not I'm not sure ,\nMarketing:So I {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:it's not mm {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it probably would be universal .\nUser Interface:Universal .\nMarketing:Because {disfmarker} {gap}\nUser Interface:And only television ? Or more devices ?\nProject Manager:I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so {disfmarker} not sure , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm , maybe , I don't know .\nMarketing:Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros\nProject Manager:Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect .\nUser Interface:Ah okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player\nProject Manager:Yeah , everything\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:just {disfmarker} so a lot of buttons {vocalsound} on the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , probably .\nUser Interface:Not just a T_V_ .\nProject Manager:No , just everything .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:{gap} . so yeah ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not {disfmarker} nothing very special , but um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well we can try to make it special .\nProject Manager:yeah , that's right .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , {gap} {disfmarker} we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . {vocalsound} Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh {vocalsound} use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .\nProject Manager:Hmm yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That's right . Should be a good point .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Nothing {gap} N\nIndustrial Designer:And how big should it be ?\nMarketing:No . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} It shouldn't be too big ,\nMarketing:I dunno um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .\nProject Manager:Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,\nMarketing:Yes\nUser Interface:maybe more trendy .\nProject Manager:But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open .\nUser Interface:Fold open ,\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nUser Interface:where you can see uh more options . I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nMarketing:Ah\nIndustrial Designer:n\nMarketing:that's that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:if you just {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .\nMarketing:Ah right right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , or you c\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .\nMarketing:Oh that's good , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah b I wanted {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Uh maybe be uh it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:There are buttons on it .\nUser Interface:No you can make an uh manual in it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .\nProject Manager:Okay . But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .\nUser Interface:But that's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh like a a to have {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , but\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think it's much uh {disfmarker} too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , maybe it would .\nMarketing:Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .\nUser Interface:Yeah , too fragile .\nMarketing:Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Kid-proof .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Oh maybe that's a good idea ,\nMarketing:Ma maybe a home station .\nProject Manager:just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:you never have to use any batteries .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah .\nUser Interface:Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I dunno .\nUser Interface:Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?\nProject Manager:I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ah yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:Maybe have {gap} uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably {disfmarker} it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .\nUser Interface:Yeah , 'cause well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are {disfmarker} uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's right , yeah .\nMarketing:and now you can put it always at the same place .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe it's {disfmarker} Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .\nUser Interface:Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .\nMarketing:Yeah . You can {disfmarker} yeah , you can buy it with it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Rechargeable .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:or you can change your batteries ,\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nProject Manager:The option , just the option , that's cool .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:uh it has to lay good in the hand ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:you you have to uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control\nMarketing:Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well I think we have to look at that ,\nMarketing:if we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,\nProject Manager:Yeah\nMarketing:but it's very hard to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .\nUser Interface:Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .\nMarketing:Nah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so you can do something unique with that .\nIndustrial Designer:And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .\nProject Manager:Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,\nIndustrial Designer:But n {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,\nMarketing:and if you fold it open {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But maybe it's\nUser Interface:Yeah {gap} .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:That's what I meant .\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nProject Manager:maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh {disfmarker} what's it's called ?\nMarketing:Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .\nProject Manager:{gap} Maybe it's hard t\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control {gap} .\nUser Interface:Okay , but yeah .\nProject Manager:Just think about it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to {disfmarker} what you have to do ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No , what you want to do with it .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think this {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together .\nMarketing:Okay . Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh .\nProject Manager:Yeah , everything .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:that you want on a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:no maybe not not uh {gap} , that's not a f that's something for for for {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Technical fun fu\nProject Manager:That's not for you . Just if {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .\nUser Interface:What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's alright .\nUser Interface:I already wrote some down , some ideas .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:Yeah , just {disfmarker} is that okay ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:There's already a document in the folder about it .\nMarketing:Yeah , me too .\nProject Manager:So see you in thirty minutes .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , well done .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so {disfmarker} your laptop .\nUser Interface:I will .\nMarketing:Oh Paul . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It didn't say that .\nProject Manager:No , sorry .\nUser Interface:Your fault .\nMarketing:Ciao .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bye bye .\nUser Interface:Bye bye .\n", "summary": "The meeting began with the Project Manager announcing the task and the agenda. The group should design an original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control through the following meetings. First of all, they did a brief equipment testing on their laptops, the pens, and the whiteboard to ensure they would work. Then getting to the main point of this meeting, the group talked about the budget and reached the agreement that it had to be a universal remote control with such a high price. The group also discussed the functions, the shape and other external design of the remote design, as well as drawing them down as a conceptual draft.", "length": 7714},

Uh Abbing . A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_ .\nProject Manager:Okay , thanks .\nUser Interface:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:I was a little short on time ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , me too , so that's not {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , same here .\nProject Manager:No no no , I just fi first my {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh . {vocalsound} Sorry .\nUser Interface:Uh let's see . Which one was mine ?\nProject Manager:So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough . {gap} Okay , perfect . So we have {disfmarker} Oh no , what's that ? So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are ,\nUser Interface:Good .\nProject Manager:that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like {disfmarker} look like . Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you . Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one . How do I escape this ? How do I I escape this s uh presentation ?\nIndustrial Designer:What ?\nUser Interface:Uh left .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ah okay .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Just {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um {disfmarker} Should be a univ uh universal remote control {disfmarker} No , that's {disfmarker} I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So have you changed that part ?\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um so {disfmarker} yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um {disfmarker} All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:Uh so {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Which one first ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Functional requirements , yeah\nMarketing:Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .\nProject Manager:I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me ,\nMarketing:You didn't read it ?\nProject Manager:I didn't get it uh anyway .\nUser Interface:No , I didn don't thing we got it .\nProject Manager:It's only for you .\nMarketing:Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nMarketing:Okay it was uh uh uh um um {vocalsound} a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the {vocalsound} uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements .\nProject Manager:The last point is quite an interesting {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .\nProject Manager:So\nMarketing:Um Martijn alr already said it .\nProject Manager:if we {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but {disfmarker} I don't think it's uh\nProject Manager:Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,\nMarketing:reachable .\nProject Manager:then you're you're {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you {vocalsound} clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly .\nUser Interface:Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .\nMarketing:Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the {vocalsound} thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't {disfmarker} We we haven't {disfmarker} Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money . {vocalsound} But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . {gap}\nProject Manager:So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .\nMarketing:But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?\nProject Manager:People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,\nMarketing:I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:because {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .\nProject Manager:It's too {disfmarker} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um then {disfmarker} I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's {vocalsound} not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise .\nProject Manager:Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably .\nMarketing:Yeah , only only for television uh {disfmarker} On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .\nMarketing:Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a {vocalsound} a new product . We have to be um {disfmarker} Yeah . One of a kind , I think .\nProject Manager:So it has to look uh uh uh unique ,\nUser Interface:Unique .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I reckon {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But old people are not looking for that .\nUser Interface:Uh I think mm {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Not really .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah .\nMarketing:to k to keep it simple when you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But uh we also have to stand out ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Sorry I thought about it , yes .\nUser Interface:'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nUser Interface:so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , this was uh my presentation .\nProject Manager:Thanks .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:I don't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Paul , you can do the next one if you want .\nMarketing:You can ask some questions or something .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yeah well {disfmarker} Uh .\nProject Manager:It's on the on the uh net net uh thing ,\nUser Interface:There it is .\nProject Manager:isn't it ?\nUser Interface:Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .\nProject Manager:So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I have it on the next page .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to {gap} . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh {disfmarker} Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ?\nProject Manager:Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,\nUser Interface:No y\nProject Manager:but not sure {gap} .\nUser Interface:Well\nProject Manager:It's a good idea , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it's {disfmarker} It was just a thought . So I'm , I u {disfmarker} I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?\nUser Interface:Well uh\nProject Manager:Uh {gap} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .\nUser Interface:Well if you said a favourite {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh mayb for me it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well i\nProject Manager:If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never .\nUser Interface:Never ? Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:No , neither do I .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh are you ?\nProject Manager:And {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay now , m maybe not .\nProject Manager:If I don't do it , maybe old people {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No , maybe elderly people uh . Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I dunno .\nUser Interface:They don't like new features . So maybe not .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable\nProject Manager:It's not , it's still not {disfmarker} It's not anymore n uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:when {disfmarker} Not anymore for T_V_ .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Right , on off . {vocalsound} I dunno , miss {disfmarker} Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need .\nUser Interface:Is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ?\nUser Interface:Just the channel um uh {disfmarker} What I mean is uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't thi\nMarketing:Forward .\nIndustrial Designer:Li like a web browser ,\nUser Interface:Six seven eight or five .\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker} Oh , okay .\nProject Manager:Just very simple .\nIndustrial Designer:But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . Like a web browser back button .\nUser Interface:Um I dunno .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nUser Interface:I don't have {disfmarker} Uh I did {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nMarketing:No . Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I don't think you use that . Y only when you want to go to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .\nProject Manager:And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Normally you can press one , zero or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:A ten plus or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:To just keep it simple and standard uh features .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh {disfmarker} Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh yeah mayb\nMarketing:It gets some seconds .\nUser Interface:But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh okay . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that {disfmarker} And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f\nMarketing:It's only for television now .\nUser Interface:So I I don't think so .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:Uh I just thought of another one .\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh {disfmarker} But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so you have\nIndustrial Designer:I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .\nUser Interface:four arrows .\nIndustrial Designer:Because you n almost never use menu button .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , a mute button . Yes .\nProject Manager:Maybe , not {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Don't think so .\nProject Manager:I don't know where where you have to put it .\nUser Interface:Yeah well ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:that's that's {disfmarker} I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right .\nUser Interface:And later we can d uh do the design .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker} Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Does it have to be {disfmarker} Uh it has to be uh with different colours\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker} I dunno . Different colours um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow\nProject Manager:It's like a iMac or something .\nMarketing:or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Just to make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well why not ? Or {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing:That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .\nProject Manager:But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .\nProject Manager:Oh , you just {disfmarker} I dunno what happened .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:Who ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:They they're uh designed very well .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But uh well , I think that's a good example .\nProject Manager:Okay , {gap}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it .\nUser Interface:Okay , sorry .\nProject Manager:Is it fin Are you finished ?\nUser Interface:Well uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things\nProject Manager:So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} Yeah . I I think so . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh j Is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's usable .\nUser Interface:Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?\nMarketing:Yeah , that's active .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or just a green one ,\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:because it's {disfmarker} If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Maybe uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , when you press it .\nProject Manager:But if you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I it's it's just uh the the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,\nIndustrial Designer:Two ?\nProject Manager:and green is like it's okay , you press the button .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I dunno .\nUser Interface:Maybe depends on uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I know .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , we make it red .\nUser Interface:But maybe {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So\nUser Interface:Well\nIndustrial Designer:I know .\nUser Interface:we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .\nProject Manager:You have to {disfmarker} The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I I think uh the batteries will be uh {vocalsound} a little {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Oh ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Empty .\nUser Interface:maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:No , we have a recharger in it , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:If we can still make that then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh maybe .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's just to indicate something's on .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .\nProject Manager:But it's cool if it was green .\nUser Interface:Yeah . It's it's not very important ,\nProject Manager:Green or red or whatever , it is cool . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .\nUser Interface:So mm {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the {disfmarker} Otherwise it won't work .\nUser Interface:So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No . I I uh {disfmarker} The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:An automatically search function for each television , or something .\nIndustrial Designer:That are working . Yeah , or {disfmarker} I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there .\nUser Interface:Well , I I use a universal uh remote control ,\nMarketing:Uh I kno\nUser Interface:and {gap} list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ? Okay .\nMarketing:Oh , I have a modern one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it ,\nIndustrial Designer:Ah okay .\nMarketing:and then it's okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:It uh search uh the pattern for itself .\nUser Interface:Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yeah .\nUser Interface:so we use that .\nIndustrial Designer:So it uh {disfmarker} We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I just say {disfmarker} Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking {disfmarker} There's just a short {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .\nMarketing:Changing the signal .\nIndustrial Designer:And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and then um it's working .\nMarketing:Yeah , that's the right uh option .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well uh the components .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um that's connecting to all the components .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .\nProject Manager:Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too .\nMarketing:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:But this one is producing infrared light\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .\nProject Manager:So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . To flash up your {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can {disfmarker} Basically if the battery is low , it won't work .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh , that's a good idea .\nMarketing:Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .\nUser Interface:No , y Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:And it's {disfmarker} you also know which button you p\nMarketing:But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's right . But it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Everywhere in the r\nProject Manager:But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED .\nUser Interface:No I don't think so , but {disfmarker} Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else .\nProject Manager:That looks different , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .\nMarketing:Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but mm like when you push it\nUser Interface:{gap} Yeah , then then won't {disfmarker} Then you won't see it .\nIndustrial Designer:n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It must be around it then .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the {disfmarker} A green light is flashing\nMarketing:Yeah , then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Not not not not here , but here .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . There . Yeah .\nMarketing:Maybe uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?\nUser Interface:{gap} Yeah , we're thinking about it .\nProject Manager:If you push {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh\nProject Manager:It lights up . Everything lights up . That's a good idea .\nUser Interface:everything lights up . Why ain't that on a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .\nUser Interface:Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:It's f Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well .\nUser Interface:Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:No , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's a good idea , okay .\nMarketing:I uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . We'll have enough power\nProject Manager:Everything agre\nIndustrial Designer:to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Everyone agrees with that , or {disfmarker} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:Maybe what Paul said , uh under the {disfmarker} on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and then you {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But you have to make a sound device in it then .\nUser Interface:And also it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , there must be sound in it .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay , it shouldn't take much {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .\nUser Interface:Uh I th\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .\nMarketing:Bec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:I think uh you also have uh {vocalsound} remote controls with a lot of options .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh . We have to give our customers some extras .\nUser Interface:Yeah . I think we will save money with that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:Okay . Are you almost finished or just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Because I was short on time .\nProject Manager:No worry .\nIndustrial Designer:But um {disfmarker} Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I just want to talk some {disfmarker} about some more . So maybe you have to {disfmarker} Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ?\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So this {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um {disfmarker} Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so ,\nIndustrial Designer:No ,\nProject Manager:but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh .\nProject Manager:We definitely should use it . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . Mm .\nUser Interface:Okay , that's {disfmarker} It changes things .\nProject Manager:I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So does it make some decision about that ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Changes .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That kinda changes the whole situation .\nMarketing:Uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,\nProject Manager:That still stays .\nUser Interface:to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:That's important I think and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .\nUser Interface:And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it .\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm ah {disfmarker} I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . {vocalsound} No , it's not {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No .\nUser Interface:So , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . What other features can we put in ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the {disfmarker} Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .\nMarketing:But uh some of you had uh something to read about um {vocalsound} uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ?\nIndustrial Designer:I didn't read {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's very {disfmarker} That's fancy . That's cool .\nUser Interface:It's very fashion .\nIndustrial Designer:I didn't read any\nMarketing:Twelve and you've got twelve .\nIndustrial Designer:b Yeah . Yeah okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I I know .\nMarketing:Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:That should be cool .\nProject Manager:Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . But {disfmarker}\nMarketing:If it's possible ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:I don't think it's very expensive actually .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know .\nMarketing:I dunno . I didn't read it .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Why should it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh if i if i\nProject Manager:You only have a microphone in it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I didn't have information about that .\nIndustrial Designer:But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Nah , maybe {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Ah that's a problem , but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And and uh w Yeah ?\nMarketing:Uh only in English . Only in English I think .\nUser Interface:What {disfmarker} But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh {disfmarker} Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:uh one to have in channel one ?\nMarketing:No , that {disfmarker} Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do {vocalsound} do we do it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nMarketing:It's more if we if we do it .\nUser Interface:I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at .\nIndustrial Designer:And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .\nUser Interface:Is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It {disfmarker} We have short time to to put it on the market ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I dunno .\nProject Manager:so that {disfmarker} We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .\nUser Interface:Mm {disfmarker} Yeah well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think so . {gap}\nProject Manager:We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . {gap}\nMarketing:Yeah , and uh and uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .\nIndustrial Designer:And and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one .\nIndustrial Designer:the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well yeah ,\nMarketing:it's not uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one ,\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} Hmm yeah , T_V_ one .\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .\nUser Interface:Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:we have to make some decisions . So\nMarketing:Okay , no speech recognition .\nProject Manager:you can see on the uh {disfmarker} So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think so .\nProject Manager:If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager:Okay , we just take that one .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:And what else , we have {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Also the one in the dark . So uh {disfmarker} It lights up when it's dark ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , but it's {disfmarker} Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .\nUser Interface:I didn't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:If you push something , it it all lights up .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah yeah ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , but um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:it it mustn't work all the time .\nUser Interface:Yes , that's what I mean .\nMarketing:It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .\nProject Manager:Or you can switch it on or something .\nMarketing:So if you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Or maybe when you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .\nUser Interface:yeah . It lights up all .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's right . You have to {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah .\nProject Manager:And do we use a a {disfmarker} Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , {gap} if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control .\nUser Interface:Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , maybe it's a good idea .\nUser Interface:Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Like uh phones .\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:Different colours . Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:so y you just make it th through {disfmarker} You look through it ?\nMarketing:A see-through . Mm , that's cool .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Uh as an option maybe .\nProject Manager:Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,\nUser Interface:It's the standard {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .\nUser Interface:Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,\nMarketing:But you have {disfmarker} You had a lot of different buttons .\nUser Interface:we but we don't {disfmarker} We don't really have any complicated buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , maybe you have you have to {disfmarker} Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .\nUser Interface:Yeah okay , but {disfmarker} Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .\nUser Interface:No , I don't need don't need {disfmarker} Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's right .\nUser Interface:I use teletext as well .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No , I use te teletext every day , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:'Cause {gap} simple buttons .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:If you put one above it , it's clear .\nProject Manager:Okay . So that's it for toda for {disfmarker} We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:How long is lunch break ?\nProject Manager:So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yo .\nProject Manager:So , we're finished for t for this time . We're going to have some lunch .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Bye .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {gap}\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:Mm . Uh .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:{gap} {vocalsound} {gap}\n", "summary": "This meeting was about the functional design of the remote control. Firstly, Marketing gave a presentation on functional requirements. Group decided to focus on the fancy and fashionable look, usability, and different colors. Next, User Interface gave a presentation on the technical function design. Also, the group discussed this topic, and they decided to design the menu buttons of the remote similar to the mobile phone. Then, Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the working design. Group mates discussed deciding on the use of LED light on the buttons to indicate the transmitting of the Morse code when pressing the button. They also decided to use a more intelligent chip than the standard one when the circuit was closed, it would produce the pattern. For the age group, they would target the age group below forty since it was a young market.", "length": 14383},

Hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , you all switched on .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yep , me too .\nProject Manager:I presume we're good to go . Okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um {vocalsound} and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um {vocalsound} and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ? Prototype presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:Is that {gap} for us ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:I think that would be you .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , shall I show ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll show . Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it\nUser Interface:I can hold it like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Make sure the camera's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:and I'll I'll show you the presentation .\nUser Interface:so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Can I just nick your {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Whoa .\nUser Interface:It looks\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Going a bit crazy over here .\nUser Interface:crazy {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Thank you .\nUser Interface:Um not now . Oh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} You should have one of those things and you can just take it off .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Ta-da .\nUser Interface:Oh , where are the hinges ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:this is our look and feel presentation , the final {disfmarker} our final presentation .\nProject Manager:Mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer:And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um\nUser Interface:'Kay . You able to look {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's gonna have a a plastic body {vocalsound} um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .\nUser Interface:Yep . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:um which there'd be sort of a wide choice {disfmarker} they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um {vocalsound} it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh {vocalsound} the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um {vocalsound} how do you say , it's {disfmarker} yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top\nUser Interface:The black and white touch screen wherein people can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm . So it's flush .\nIndustrial Designer:and the buttons at the bottom would d\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:so so it'll fully close flat .\nProject Manager:Oh right , okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And working on the inside we've um already said {disfmarker} d decided on the kinetic batteries , which {disfmarker} actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:'cause it's the top part that's {disfmarker} okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in {vocalsound} and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Or something . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And then {disfmarker} yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:I'm under the sofa .\nUser Interface:Ah oka\nProject Manager:Or , that would be too complicated .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's {disfmarker} be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .\nProject Manager:Infrared {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:Um it would it would have {disfmarker} obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . {vocalsound} And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the {disfmarker} on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the {disfmarker} we haven't {disfmarker} I don't think we actually put it on .\nProject Manager:Like here .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , something like that .\nUser Interface:Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here .\nProject Manager:Okay . Actually , no , it would be {disfmarker} it would have to be on the on the front .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .\nUser Interface:{gap} . So when it's {disfmarker} even if it's open here , the signals would go {gap} .\nProject Manager:Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing ,\nIndustrial Designer:So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .\nProject Manager:yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that would make sense .\nIndustrial Designer:And then finally um on to the interface . {vocalsound} The top screen , as we said , is {disfmarker} would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen\nUser Interface:{gap} This one right here .\nIndustrial Designer:which {disfmarker} yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And now we've {disfmarker} we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .\nUser Interface:Which is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product\nIndustrial Designer:No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing .\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:once it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Look up to it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics ,\nProject Manager:Thank you very much .\nIndustrial Designer:as that is {disfmarker} that's the company logo {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yay .\nProject Manager:Wrapping it all up , okay .\nMarketing:Well done .\nProject Manager:Um I've now got evaluation criteria .\nMarketing:Certainly .\nUser Interface:So this is the one . Sorry .\nProject Manager:It's to be presented {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:There you go . {gap} .\nMarketing:Logged in ? Thank you . Oops .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Evaluation . {gap} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm um I I think this is {gap} chip .\nProject Manager:It's quite similar to what it was before , though .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Sorry .\nMarketing:This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . {vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . {vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ?\nUser Interface:Ah , it's perfect .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:we're going to look at these crite So\nUser Interface:Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yes ,\nUser Interface:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:we're going to come to {disfmarker} w we'll discuss each one\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Is that okay ?\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nMarketing:One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . {vocalsound} This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Just write small .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Criteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , so you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . That works .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy {disfmarker} it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I would agree .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh {vocalsound} two {disfmarker} yeah ,\nMarketing:I'll just go this way .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:two or three .\nMarketing:Two .\nIndustrial Designer:No , three . Three .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:I would say two .\nMarketing:Two .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I would say four .\nMarketing:A four , okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right .\nUser Interface:Almost three .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yeah .\nMarketing:Two and three quarters ?\nUser Interface:I think yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . {vocalsound} Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three .\nIndustrial Designer:I'd give it a one .\nMarketing:Okay . Not that you're biased {vocalsound} in that it {disfmarker} the designer .\nIndustrial Designer:No , no , not at all .\nProject Manager:A two .\nUser Interface:Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first .\nMarketing:The average {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I I just {gap} it the other way .\nMarketing:oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ?\nUser Interface:Uh in {gap} Yep , I just got {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered {disfmarker} Okay ,\nUser Interface:two point f\nMarketing:and we're just waiting for your rating\nProject Manager:It's just two point five for that one .\nMarketing:f\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Two point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay .\nUser Interface:One is a {gap} , seven is false , okay .\nMarketing:So what are you rating for this one , Paw ?\nUser Interface:Two .\nMarketing:Two , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two ,\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nMarketing:nice and simple , yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nMarketing:Two .\nProject Manager:I would say a two . I would say a two .\nMarketing:A two , okay .\nUser Interface:Two .\nMarketing:Two . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} We'll just put almost two ,\nProject Manager:One point seven f five .\nMarketing:because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .\nProject Manager:Okay , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Or we {disfmarker} or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at\nIndustrial Designer:D_ .\nMarketing:it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .\nIndustrial Designer:One . Yeah .\nMarketing:Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?\nIndustrial Designer:No , no , the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue ,\nUser Interface:White . With {disfmarker} for the plastic ? Uh blue .\nIndustrial Designer:but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Any {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , yeah\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And the spongy feel is no problem with that .\nUser Interface:Yeah , because you'll be having a {disfmarker} Because of the rubber case .\nIndustrial Designer:No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that {disfmarker} otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic .\nMarketing:Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .\nMarketing:Yep .\nProject Manager:One .\nMarketing:Everybody ? Okay .\nUser Interface:One .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} That part was nice and easy .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:I don't think we've really touched on that a lot .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_\nIndustrial Designer:It's meant to be .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:it's meant to . Um\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:maybe because it's slightl\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:with the size that we've got it's quite small ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Right .\nProject Manager:It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually ,\nMarketing:A five , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Four .\nMarketing:Four and a four okay .\nUser Interface:Four .\nMarketing:Twenty one {disfmarker} is that twenty one ?\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:So that's four point two five .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep .\nMarketing:And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition ,\nUser Interface:Voice r recognition .\nMarketing:It was the I'm here thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} yeah , that's feasible .\nMarketing:That sounds good then . I'd go for a {disfmarker} I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or .\nIndustrial Designer:Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand\nProject Manager:A standard .\nIndustrial Designer:it would be quite loud .\nProject Manager:It would be .\nMarketing:Right . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So it would be s p\nMarketing:You built into the feature .\nProject Manager:And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . Logical . That's a one for me .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , one .\nMarketing:One\nProject Manager:One .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:and one , good .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} So ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:how do we feel about this ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {gap}\nMarketing:We've got our our {disfmarker} we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?\nProject Manager:I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer:W I thin yeah , I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:We happy to go ahead ?\nProject Manager:I think we {disfmarker} yeah . I think we're set .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .\nProject Manager:Do much apart from having a huge big {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ?\nProject Manager:Don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , thank you .\nMarketing:Oops .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay ,\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:I've got finance here now . I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's okay . Um .\nMarketing:Oh yes .\nUser Interface:You want me to b unplug that ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {gap}\nUser Interface:That's all . Yes .\nProject Manager:Thanks . Right .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Now I presume that the screen will go blank ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:that um {disfmarker} Okay . We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . So are we still on for kinetic ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . Right , what's happening with the electronics ?\nIndustrial Designer:It was a regular chip on print\nUser Interface:Chip on print .\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Double-curved .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh , no , no , no , the um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's {disfmarker} you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . In the top , it's the number\nProject Manager:Oh , right ,\nIndustrial Designer:of c yeah {gap} .\nProject Manager:okay . Thanks .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:So , would there be two ?\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker} yeah , just a {disfmarker} no , one reg v uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:One chip .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:And they're double curved . No .\nUser Interface:Single-curved .\nProject Manager:One double curve .\nIndustrial Designer:Y Two ,\nUser Interface:Two curves , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause it's two .\nMarketing:But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest .\nProject Manager:So what's a single curve then ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w\nMarketing:It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . {gap} like a domed thing .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , I think I think it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Single-cu\nProject Manager:So just one double {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:One double-curved .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:And one {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Plastic and rubber .\nIndustrial Designer:no , 'cause one {disfmarker} yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's\nMarketing:The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound} Um we've got plastic and rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer:a plastic .\nProject Manager:haven't we ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Plastic one and maybe rubber point five .\nIndustrial Designer:And special colour .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface:No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing ,\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:we can put point five .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Do you think ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:What does it mean if you put point five for that ?\nUser Interface:It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .\nProject Manager:It would be like saying we're using {disfmarker} See , it says case material . So\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ?\nIndustrial Designer:No , no , that's {disfmarker} it's as an extra .\nProject Manager:It's including , it's including .\nMarketing:Right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .\nMarketing:But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ?\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?\nProject Manager:Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ?\nMarketing:Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .\nProject Manager:N yeah , okay . {vocalsound} Interface .\nUser Interface:Push-button .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:One .\nIndustrial Designer:the push-button's one and L_C_ display one .\nUser Interface:An One .\nProject Manager:Buttons {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And buttons {disfmarker}\nMarketing:S\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think we could change the battery also . Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .\nMarketing:Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ?\nProject Manager:Has that not gone up ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well yes .\nMarketing:Is it {disfmarker} oh , it's brought it slightly down .\nProject Manager:Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot .\nMarketing:So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:is that going to make a difference ?\nUser Interface:Uncurved , flat .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? .\nUser Interface:No ,\nIndustrial Designer:No ,\nUser Interface:it just surprises one .\nIndustrial Designer:we'll have {disfmarker}\nMarketing:It's gone up again .\nProject Manager:Oh , it's not calculated it .\nIndustrial Designer:No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again .\nMarketing:Oh .\nProject Manager:Okay , there we go .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} It's brought it down slightly .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's not a lot though .\nUser Interface:{gap} . {vocalsound} I don't think so .\nIndustrial Designer:C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .\nProject Manager:We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though ,\nMarketing:Is there anything on the menu {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No .\nUser Interface:Ri I think it's in Euro {gap} .\nProject Manager:Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um {vocalsound} and the interface .\nMarketing:If we tr um . If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?\nUser Interface:And going to a regular bat Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , the standard , it {vocalsound} um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away {disfmarker} if you took away {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:If you to\nUser Interface:It's internal , nobody looks into the battery .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi\nMarketing:And people are used to buying batteries ,\nIndustrial Designer:If if you take away the voice ,\nMarketing:they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .\nUser Interface:Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm .\nMarketing:Should we see what difference it makes ?\nProject Manager:Where's the\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah i yeah .\nProject Manager:where's the voice recognition ?\nIndustrial Designer:No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker .\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .\nProject Manager:Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's {disfmarker} that's minus three .\nIndustrial Designer:They {vocalsound} n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two .\nProject Manager:Oh , right . I keep seeing zero . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We can do it some other way ,\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:we can do {disfmarker} it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:You could choose to have that or not .\nMarketing:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:But they {disfmarker} but I mean in {disfmarker} I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .\nMarketing:But we're still working to um head o\nProject Manager:So should we just change the design specification then ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Make it costly .\nMarketing:We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as {disfmarker} this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we {disfmarker} the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:We c we could s\nMarketing:But we need to work to that specification to start with .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , we could say {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers\nProject Manager:Okay , we can make the price fit ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I s\nProject Manager:and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this ,\nIndustrial Designer:And then say we recommend {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:because it also sets it apart from the crowd .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it .\nProject Manager:They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's {vocalsound} s something completely different associated with your company .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right , okay , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So if we take voice recognition out {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:That'll do it . Twelve point three five .\nUser Interface:Yeah we are close to the budget .\nMarketing:{gap} we are .\nIndustrial Designer:Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?\nUser Interface:Two five .\nProject Manager:It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five .\nMarketing:Are you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there .\nProject Manager:Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five ,\nMarketing:Right . {vocalsound} Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ?\nUser Interface:It's twelve point five maybe , then .\nProject Manager:isn't it ?\nMarketing:Which is less than ten P_ .\nUser Interface:I don't know what {disfmarker} it said fifty percent of the cost . So half of the price would be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think the agenda one was where the um price was , wasn't it ? No .\nUser Interface:I think it is the first one .\nMarketing:That's today's kick off meeting , {gap} .\nProject Manager:Twelve point five .\nMarketing:Mm . {gap} I thought that's what it was .\nUser Interface:So we are under the budget .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Ah .\nProject Manager:Well done , people .\nMarketing:So we're okay .\nProject Manager:So\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . No .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Seems fine .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think that's brilliant .\nUser Interface:Except voice recognition , everything is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Right , so we've done that . Okay . Product evaluation . We've done room for creativity , haven't we ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't {disfmarker} didn't feel able to make . Um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:um in the sense that um did you feel like a team ? Or did you feel like {vocalsound} uh autonomy ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I'd say , as a team .\nUser Interface:I think we had a nice time .\nMarketing:Although we had our separate tasks ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other .\nIndustrial Designer:Find out from each other , yeah .\nMarketing:And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . It's not like people trying to cut each other . There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . We came to a very predic creative design , yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I think . And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well .\nProject Manager:Thank you . How did you find it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually {disfmarker} if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . I like that . Um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:teamwork . Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , well .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I think that was the best part\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} uh I'm still not caught up .\nUser Interface:of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s .\nProject Manager:Maybe .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:No , that was quite fun . Um {vocalsound} means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ?\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Discuss which ones {disfmarker}\nMarketing:How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Could it've been better , was it adequate ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more .\nProject Manager:Had time to kind of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But it was nice having it there . Um like the whole picture of the thing .\nUser Interface:Yeah , {gap} moving around the room . {vocalsound} But I think it's good ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:like uh we spent times individually . I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general ,\nMarketing:It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in ,\nProject Manager:rather than {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:it so it's {disfmarker} I mean nothing is new ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:but it's applying it to a d in a different area .\nIndustrial Designer:Vegetables .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} That's mine .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , no . Well\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:they have to come from somewhere , don't they ?\nMarketing:Absolutely , yeah .\nUser Interface:The thing is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And as sh as w sorry ,\nUser Interface:Yep , sorry ,\nProject Manager:you go .\nUser Interface:go on Sarah .\nProject Manager:Um as was shown by {vocalsound} your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly .\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh d they don't really think about it ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ .\nMarketing:Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah .\nProject Manager:But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you ,\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being {disfmarker} a plastic was being made for you .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But people could {gap} have anything that they wanted .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that .\nProject Manager:Because of the produ Mm .\nUser Interface:And new f television products coming up ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but nobody giving uh much idea to this . Like Sarah was telling , everything's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think it's really good that this has been very market research based ,\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:because {vocalsound} just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Well , it's innovation for money's sake .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:The the people have to keep buying .\nMarketing:But forcing it onto people ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:yeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want .\nProject Manager:And you can't get {disfmarker} you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone ,\nMarketing:Mm . Mm .\nProject Manager:because the phones have moved on , things like that .\nMarketing:Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:yeah .\nProject Manager:It's madness . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:See I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:In closing {disfmarker} There we go .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} our costs are below budget with recommendations that they {disfmarker} the budget be increased , but I think {disfmarker} I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well .\nMarketing:I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .\nIndustrial Designer:I think that was just the the physical .\nProject Manager:So it looks {disfmarker} well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Maybe fifty percent more .\nProject Manager:But I think {disfmarker} but you were saying that that's quite {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think {disfmarker} yeah I don't {disfmarker} from the market research .\nMarketing:But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do ,\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:No . Yeah , it was {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I think we've done very well to get within budget\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:and it still makes such an innovative item\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:that I think people are really gonna want .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It's a shame it won't ever get made . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I know .\nUser Interface:Who knows ?\nProject Manager:Maybe it will .\nMarketing:Maybe it will . Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas\nProject Manager:Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it .\nIndustrial Designer:I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is .\nMarketing:and sell it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um the project has been evaluated well and truly .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:There's a final questionnaire .\nProject Manager:Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with {vocalsound} {vocalsound} everything that I fell behind with ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} In your {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so good luck .\nUser Interface:Celebration , you didn't talk about that .\nProject Manager:I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nMarketing:Questionnaire .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Is that it then ?\nProject Manager:Um yeah , just the last , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:Awesome .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .\nMarketing:Questionnaire done . Oh , I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time .\nIndustrial Designer:Was that not the questionnaire for the {disfmarker} how you felt you'd done in your thing ?\nMarketing:Oh , right .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think .\nMarketing:But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , the the s\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . I think {disfmarker} yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:I just got con\n", "summary": "The team mainly planned the remote control project down to the last detail in the final meeting. Industrial Designer presented the prototype as a clam-shell design with a flip-top LCD touch screen and fully closed flat buttons at the bottom. There would be a wide choice of colours and patterns due to customization. Inside the remote control, there would be a standard chip and a kinetic battery. The team was under the budget at present. Once the budget increased, however, the voice recognition would be incorporated. The remote control's fashion style and location function were most highly rated among the team members, but the minimization of repetitive strain injury was not satisfying enough. All members gave their sincere feedback on teamwork and leadership.", "length": 14233},

You can't ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:sorry .\nUser Interface:So just cancel it .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} Well , during my work I have no time either .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Well ,\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:this is life . {vocalsound} Sorry uh , Roo .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . {vocalsound} Accidentally .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .\nUser Interface:But it's alright .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think so too .\nProject Manager:Roo ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Ruud ?\nMarketing:Almost . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Almost , okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m\nUser Interface:But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um we will figure that out . Ca {vocalsound} can you try to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the {gap} .\nProject Manager:Yeah , w we will see .\nUser Interface:I don't think it's wireless here .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} it is , yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It is .\nUser Interface:Or it is . Yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer:It is .\nUser Interface:Okay , great .\nMarketing:Uh okay .\nProject Manager:Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um {vocalsound} we have forty minutes . So it's now {disfmarker} Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . {vocalsound} It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:uh uh {disfmarker} we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with .\nUser Interface:Time , yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , {vocalsound} which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um {vocalsound} then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I'll start .\nProject Manager:Uh uh yeah . Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:great .\nUser Interface:Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show . Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nUser Interface:So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .\nProject Manager:Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , uh b uh most .\nProject Manager:Okay , so\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:the important thing here is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .\nMarketing:Oh , user-friendly .\nProject Manager:In the market , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Excuse me . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,\nUser Interface:Energies and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?\nProject Manager:No , it's not visible .\nIndustrial Designer:No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w\nUser Interface:The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .\nIndustrial Designer:yes . In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . {vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .\nProject Manager:So it's fairly easy .\nIndustrial Designer:There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Succeed in it also .\nIndustrial Designer:and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh\nProject Manager:good .\nIndustrial Designer:personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .\nUser Interface:if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So we can use them . So that's no problem .\nUser Interface:For the same costs , it's can be uh in our {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We can we can make its I think .\nMarketing:Well you could only lit uh the buttons {disfmarker} the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .\nMarketing:Or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:But I think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,\nMarketing:Hmm , true . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and not for {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .\nIndustrial Designer:No no no , no . That's right , that's right .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um have a think about it .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , Ruud .\nMarketing:Oh , mine is already outdated .\nProject Manager:Okay well ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So any income is welcome . {vocalsound} Input .\nMarketing:Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of {gap} {disfmarker} of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Could you step a little bit more to the right ? {vocalsound} Yeah , thank you . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh well , skip this . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .\nProject Manager:Okay . Well , that's interesting .\nMarketing:Or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Or a find {disfmarker} a finding function ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:you know .\nProject Manager:that's definitely interesting .\nIndustrial Designer:That's quite a {disfmarker} yes .\nProject Manager:It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .\nUser Interface:Sound signal .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:go on .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nMarketing:Well , I just said that . And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it .\nProject Manager:Okay . So that's what the market tells us .\nMarketing:Uh that's about it , yes .\nProject Manager:Yep . Okay .\nUser Interface:The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .\nMarketing:Uh mo uh zap buttons most .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons . And first um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .\nUser Interface:Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well\nMarketing:Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . {vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Another device is not a solution .\nProject Manager:Well\nIndustrial Designer:Usually {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,\nUser Interface:It should be uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:like um turning on and off the the the lights .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .\nProject Manager:Reports rep respend response to it .\nIndustrial Designer:And um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:just like uh the phones Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing .\nUser Interface:the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But uh th\nUser Interface:But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No , so we we should use something else .\nMarketing:And you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But I believe you will have an {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , and usually {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We do not control the T_V_ set so well .\nMarketing:And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , m yes . S and we b we want {gap} to make so it's {gap} {disfmarker} is easy as possible for our customers ,\nMarketing:and it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so we should think about {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se\nUser Interface:I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} And b\nProject Manager:Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , a peak . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .\nMarketing:So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's true .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes ,\nUser Interface:But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something .\nIndustrial Designer:so we don't want that .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe we can {disfmarker} Something like that .\nUser Interface:Well if you lost th\nIndustrial Designer:Well ,\nProject Manager:Well uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I don't think uh {gap} .\nUser Interface:Uh that's just uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .\nUser Interface:{gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's not a good idea .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . I will .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:um and it will become more costly also .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp\nUser Interface:And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .\nUser Interface:It's a unique item uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , it's a distinction in the market .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .\nProject Manager:It's a different {disfmarker} exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .\nUser Interface:And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:What should we choose in in design ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .\nUser Interface:Well , the extra functions .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .\nUser Interface:Used option .\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well , we skip that .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .\nIndustrial Designer:No , no .\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Nope .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's out of the question .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .\nIndustrial Designer:I think also . Yes . Well ,\nProject Manager:No .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:'cause young people uh like new features .\nProject Manager:Mm yeah .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , that's right .\nProject Manager:Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .\nProject Manager:But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Because we do not implement uh a user history .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .\nProject Manager:I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .\nMarketing:And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , draw draw it on the board .\nUser Interface:should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , something like that . Oh\nUser Interface:It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .\nIndustrial Designer:It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes .\nUser Interface:A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down\nProject Manager:Yeah , it can break down .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:or uh\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , yes .\nUser Interface:just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think .\nMarketing:A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh .\nIndustrial Designer:But you're the marketing man .\nMarketing:And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .\nUser Interface:Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:The programme up and down . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , yeah .\nUser Interface:And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , that's good .\nProject Manager:Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think .\nProject Manager:Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yes ?\nProject Manager:We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?\nProject Manager:Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:The ten digits .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Yes .\nProject Manager:Yeah . A bit of a split mode .\nIndustrial Designer:Change .\nProject Manager:Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , yes .\nProject Manager:Dual channel watch .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay , well um\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:you're the secretary . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?\nMarketing:Mielsen .\nProject Manager:Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm okay ,\nUser Interface:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , that's important .\nProject Manager:And and do we want um the ten digits ?\nUser Interface:The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , are are you sure ?\nMarketing:Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not so sure .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , that's complicated ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so .\nUser Interface:I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay ,\nUser Interface:Uh and I think the most {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I can imagine when\nProject Manager:I agree actually . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Just elder elder people would would buy it ,\nIndustrial Designer:I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .\nProject Manager:But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .\nMarketing:But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yep . The older people only use five of them .\nIndustrial Designer:Well ,\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:but how how often do you watch all these channels ?\nMarketing:and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .\nProject Manager:Often .\nIndustrial Designer:No , you're probably right .\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?\nProject Manager:Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:The design .\nUser Interface:On the design .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it .\nMarketing:Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy\nMarketing:And {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .\nProject Manager:Exactly , exactly .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , speech .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .\nProject Manager:To find {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits\nIndustrial Designer:But maybe when we uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but keep the programme and the volume ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Okay , okay .\nMarketing:Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but\nProject Manager:Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .\nUser Interface:So\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's that's a big advantage , I think .\nProject Manager:Okay , g good .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:But maybe can {disfmarker} we we can think something smart about it .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .\nProject Manager:But {disfmarker} But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?\nIndustrial Designer:You have to do nothing for it .\nMarketing:M {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Twelve dollar fifty . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Because it seems like a very {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Maybe , maybe not .\nMarketing:And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .\nIndustrial Designer:I'll have to find that out . Yes . So {disfmarker} No , that's very cheap .\nMarketing:'Cause when {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Is a cradle very cheap ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's {disfmarker} Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .\nProject Manager:I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .\nIndustrial Designer:It's {disfmarker} Yes , but they're they're mass production .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:They're very cheap .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So it will cost us p practically nothing .\nProject Manager:Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um {vocalsound} I would like to hear um {disfmarker} maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?\nMarketing:Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So {disfmarker} I don't think that's a big problem\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay , so\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh {disfmarker} Profitable . We we {disfmarker} yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .\nMarketing:Yes . Yeah , profitable .\nIndustrial Designer:Profitable .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Yes .\nProject Manager:O okay . {vocalsound} Um Roo . {gap} {disfmarker} Nothing to add .\nUser Interface:I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .\nProject Manager:Sebastian ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um\nProject Manager:Yeah ? Great .\nIndustrial Designer:so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that {disfmarker} these kinds of things .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .\nProject Manager:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not {disfmarker} do not implement these buttons . {vocalsound} If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that {disfmarker} we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And this even uh makes it more cheapy .\nUser Interface:But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:The board .\nUser Interface:The circuit board .\nIndustrial Designer:The circuit board .\nUser Interface:The fewer buttons you can use on it .\nProject Manager:No , it's th\nIndustrial Designer:The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:It's the other way around , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage .\nProject Manager:It shouldn't be a big issue .\nUser Interface:Well it {disfmarker} then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh {disfmarker} especially for the voice recognition .\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker} Yes , because I don't know {disfmarker} Yes . I d I really don't know . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:It can be costly . Maybe not .\nProject Manager:I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Um I'm not sure how how that {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh {vocalsound} have a lo uh look at it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , great . Um {vocalsound} well , I think we're qui quite done .\nUser Interface:We're done , I think .\nProject Manager:Um for now we will have the lunch break .\nIndustrial Designer:How nice .\nProject Manager:Um I'm {disfmarker} don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out .\nUser Interface:Me neither .\nProject Manager:Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um {vocalsound} the Interface Designer , um I would like to {disfmarker} the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept .\nUser Interface:Interface {disfmarker} industrial .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept .\nIndustrial Designer:Well , we understand . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And um\nUser Interface:Uh the only problem is it {disfmarker} that it depends on the divisions {disfmarker} the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition .\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Well , i it should be easy ,\nUser Interface:Well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um {vocalsound} um yeah , some some fancy lights .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm yes .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I think that's what we decided .\nIndustrial Designer:So we drop the voice recognition ?\nProject Manager:No no no , we didn't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but it shouldn't be integrated {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh .\nProject Manager:yeah , it's {disfmarker} of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:or can we decide next meeting ?\nProject Manager:We can decide the next meeting . Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:And I'm sure the market will um uh {vocalsound} {gap} uh will change , adapt\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Adapt .\nIndustrial Designer:Adapt .\nMarketing:Left .\nProject Manager:and um so\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now .\nUser Interface:That's it .\nProject Manager:Any other questions\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:or can we have the lunch ?\nIndustrial Designer:We can have the lunch .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I'll take the lunch .\nProject Manager:Good .\n", "summary": "This is the second meeting of the design group. Project Manager introduced new project requirements at first. The management required a remote control only for television and aimed at customers under 40. In terms of user interface design, User Interface focused on user-friendliness but still thought multi-function should be considered. Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to substitute voice recognition for the ten digits. He also suggested that they should use infrared so that the remote control could be connected with most TV sets. After that, in order to solve the problem of energy source, the team decided to include a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged.", "length": 13183},
{"id": 22, "conversations": "Project Manager:'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You could change the vegetable , or fruit .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , I can change the vegetable .\nProject Manager:Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'S a very bright strawberry . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .\nUser Interface:It's been a l\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah .\nUser Interface:And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator . How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .\nUser Interface:Okay so that's just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere\nUser Interface:So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah we didn't design that .\nUser Interface:Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .\nIndustrial Designer:But it would be coordinating with that of course .\nUser Interface:Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So . Tada .\nProject Manager:Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . {vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .\nProject Manager:Oh . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and {disfmarker} d I dunno what that means .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:One side is curved and then the other side is curved .\nProject Manager:Well {disfmarker} yeah . If we're talking about the area just {disfmarker} oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um and lots of special colours actually . {vocalsound} Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?\nIndustrial Designer:No I think that's alright .\nProject Manager:Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:And if we sold a lot of squishy things .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Boo yeah . Okay . {vocalsound} S So {disfmarker} Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um evaluation criteria .\nProject Manager:Okay . Do you wanna {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I've got a presentation .\nProject Manager:Okay . I think that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So I need {disfmarker} where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't {disfmarker} okay . Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Um so the que the questions I've given you {disfmarker} c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing:Yeah it's in the um {disfmarker} it's in the project documents .\nUser Interface:Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes .\nMarketing:It's called evaluation criteria .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:And it's under evaluation .\nProject Manager:Huh , the PowerPoint one ?\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm ?\nUser Interface:Okay . Cool .\nMarketing:Yeah . You've found it all ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:So it was um {disfmarker} Yeah true's one .\nUser Interface:True's one and false is seven .\nMarketing:Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?\nProject Manager:Um we can do it separately and then discuss it\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah okay .\nProject Manager:if if that's what people wanna do .\nUser Interface:So it's actually a scale .\nProject Manager:Wait , one is true and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Um ,\nProject Manager:so these are the questions we're answering . And one is {disfmarker}\nMarketing:yes it's {disfmarker} if it's fancy you put one ,\nProject Manager:One , right okay .\nMarketing:if it's really unfancy it's seven .\nProject Manager:If it's somewhere in between you put four .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah , something .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound} Does it feel fancy ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Feels like play-dough .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:They shouldn't really be questions . Should be more like {disfmarker} Are the batteries easy to insert ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I'm gonna say yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yes ? Very very true . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I imagine they're somewhere on the front . We have a little case that you slip 'em in .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Are we just about ready ?\nMarketing:Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we {disfmarker} um is it necessary ?\nProject Manager:I don't think so . It's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:We'll just do um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:Our animals will forever be there .\nMarketing:Yeah . Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Un unless you feel you need it t to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't feel any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:okay okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:We'll {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:right um {disfmarker} Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay\nUser Interface:One .\nIndustrial Designer:Five .\nMarketing:Right . Ooh I don't know .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Right . One ?\nIndustrial Designer:Five .\nProject Manager:Five .\nMarketing:Five .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ?\nProject Manager:I I think we should {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's four if you wanna do that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It adds to sixteen , so that's four .\nMarketing:Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh I thought she said five .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . I think that's um {disfmarker} next ?\nUser Interface:Um three .\nIndustrial Designer:Six .\nProject Manager:Six .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Really ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Two .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I wasn't cheating I swear .\nMarketing:Uh-oh . Right . One point three is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So it's a one was true and seven was false ?\nProject Manager:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Huh ?\nUser Interface:{gap} Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ?\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh I thought it was the other way round .\nIndustrial Designer:Wait a minute .\nMarketing:I really {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I thought it was the other way round too .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:Yeah yeah . It was one is true and {vocalsound} false is seven .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I should've kept the table up .\nProject Manager:Oh gosh . Okay . Well {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Right , well I'm glad this came out .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I thought you guys hated it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} Oh that's quite funny {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay . {gap}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay . So , starting again , one point one ?\nUser Interface:One .\nIndustrial Designer:Say two .\nProject Manager:Three .\nMarketing:Two . Okay , one point two ?\nUser Interface:Uh three .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nProject Manager:Two .\nMarketing:Two . Okay . Um , one point three ?\nUser Interface:One .\nProject Manager:One .\nIndustrial Designer:One .\nMarketing:Ha . {vocalsound} Two point one ?\nProject Manager:Two .\nUser Interface:Uh two .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh two .\nProject Manager:Two point {disfmarker} I think I missed two . {vocalsound} Wait , is that two point one ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:One point four , one point five . Okay right\nMarketing:Oh dear , okay . Sorry .\nProject Manager:that's {disfmarker} I have two of them .\nIndustrial Designer:Mine has all kinds of problems .\nMarketing:Two and one .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Sorry about that . T two point two , which is one point five .\nProject Manager:One .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh three . Wait why did I put three ?\nUser Interface:Uh one .\nIndustrial Designer:I meant one on mine too .\nMarketing:Okay . Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:Uh one .\nIndustrial Designer:Three point one . I have four .\nProject Manager:Three .\nMarketing:One , four , three , three , three point two ?\nIndustrial Designer:Three .\nProject Manager:Three .\nUser Interface:Uh . One .\nMarketing:Three point three .\nUser Interface:One .\nIndustrial Designer:One .\nProject Manager:Two .\nMarketing:Four point one ?\nUser Interface:One .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nProject Manager:Five .\nMarketing:Two . Four point two .\nUser Interface:Two .\nIndustrial Designer:Three .\nProject Manager:Four .\nMarketing:Two and four point three .\nIndustrial Designer:Two .\nMarketing:One , two .\nUser Interface:One .\nProject Manager:Two .\nMarketing:Right so I put one on that .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue .\nProject Manager:Okay . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .\nProject Manager:No no that's um {disfmarker} I think we should look at the ones that {vocalsound} like where s where people said four , where {disfmarker} um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .\nMarketing:I didn't know how else to do it . Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Do {disfmarker} does every ones have the slide ?\nProject Manager:The {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Three point one .\nProject Manager:that was material .\nMarketing:Slide show . Material {vocalsound} technologically innovative , okay . Um ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:do you want to change it ? What are the suggestions ? I don't know , anyone ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ?\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah that {disfmarker} it's three point one was not that good . Four point one .\nProject Manager:Does the shape {disfmarker}\nMarketing:The shape .\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Four point two ?\nProject Manager:See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the {disfmarker} is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It {disfmarker} or bigger ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think the wheel would probably be {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager:Because {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And like then it {disfmarker} you could hold it in your hand better .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .\nProject Manager:Yeah . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get {disfmarker} that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:The flat one . Yeah .\nProject Manager:so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .\nUser Interface:I didn't {disfmarker} yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm .\nUser Interface:But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah like certain ones {disfmarker} you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:like you could probably do a strawberry still .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think the broccoli would be out .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You could do {gap} , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like {disfmarker} sorta like a joystick .\nProject Manager:Yeah that I I {disfmarker} when you were holding that before , it actually looked {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . That looked really good .\nUser Interface:I don't know . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?\nUser Interface:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:Not that I can think of . Rhubarb . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Rhubarb .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I think that broccoli is my favourite actually .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} These obscure fruits .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Uh despite the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think we needn't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What if um the {disfmarker} it was just patterns on like {disfmarker} we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .\nUser Interface:Huh ?\nProject Manager:You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .\nUser Interface:Oh okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .\nUser Interface:Yeah . That could work .\nMarketing:Yeah . {gap}\nProject Manager:Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . I dunno .\nProject Manager:But if we if we need {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah and just have the colour match or something .\nProject Manager:yeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Or like {disfmarker} I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think {disfmarker} see as like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:like you could {disfmarker} if it was only this {disfmarker} you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:So like maybe that's just too big\nProject Manager:Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,\nUser Interface:because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:which is a nice kind of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah . But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap} I dunno .\nProject Manager:I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?\nUser Interface:I guess {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:'Cause like kind of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Or like even {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Dif\nIndustrial Designer:We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .\nProject Manager:Or even like {disfmarker} Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do {disfmarker} I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .\nProject Manager:'Cause that , I think {disfmarker} I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:And you could {disfmarker} like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Alright .\nProject Manager:But I mean it {disfmarker} do we have any other ideas about that ?\nMarketing:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:We could tr I don't know .\nMarketing:Think the critical ones came out to be {disfmarker} yeah that one . {vocalsound} . Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:which can be easily {disfmarker} I think that's not a problem any more .\nProject Manager:The batteries are going in the back ?\nIndustrial Designer:That {disfmarker} everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one {disfmarker} I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,\nProject Manager:no you could {disfmarker} Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah um like on a normal remote .\nProject Manager:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:I think everyone's under three anyway .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points .\nUser Interface:Cool . Well {disfmarker} Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} We were a bit off task .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Um so uh I can't think of any {disfmarker} So we'll have to like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,\nIndustrial Designer:It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .\nUser Interface:but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .\nProject Manager:Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah that's true . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Which is why printing might be like {disfmarker} just printing the fruit on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} fruit .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm . {vocalsound} Not really {disfmarker} Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . {vocalsound} Um so project evaluation .\nMarketing:Do you want this and we can all {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager:I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied {disfmarker} oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah .\nMarketing:It's alright yeah ?\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker} Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Sure .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I did .\nProject Manager:I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Sponginess . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:The prototype making was very creatively stimulating\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:And how was our leadership and teamwork ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .\nProject Manager:Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Um .\nUser Interface:I think you were fine .\nProject Manager:Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now .\nUser Interface:You did a good job leading .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .\nMarketing:Yeah we didn't {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} uh it all c sort of blended quite well .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like {vocalsound} I don't know , all had ideas about it but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah . Very democratic . No spats , that was good .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um and the means for like {disfmarker} the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I mean we used {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .\nProject Manager:Are you a Mac person ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:No no I never touch Macs either .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .\nProject Manager:Huh .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:Which isn't very user-friendly though . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} Well the problem is if you don't {disfmarker} like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now . But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .\nUser Interface:I felt like my {disfmarker} I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my {disfmarker} the information that was available to me was kind of just like {disfmarker} or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda {disfmarker} it was kinda like okay , I don't really think {disfmarker} I dunno what I'm doing here .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , {vocalsound} think it's kinda stupid .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . I never use it .\nUser Interface:Yeah but uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . Like I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It didn't really {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:It {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .\nMarketing:I though it was brilliant no ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Really ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .\nProject Manager:I mean m my problem {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah it probably does .\nUser Interface:So like a f\nMarketing:I think it depends on the role\nProject Manager:yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah I think so .\nMarketing:no ?\nProject Manager:'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like {disfmarker} they'd put {disfmarker} send you to sites and stuff right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . And when you were talking about it I was just like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:'cause I {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:As if you'd wanted to .\nMarketing:Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um\nProject Manager:System . Yeah .\nMarketing:a whole system ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah I mean , it {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , huh .\nIndustrial Designer:It seems planned you know .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah I kinda thought that um {disfmarker} I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:because {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like {disfmarker} we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:No . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:If I hadn't been told that fruit was {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But I think that {vocalsound} it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing .\nProject Manager:Oh right . given certain information or {disfmarker} Just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:yeah .\nMarketing:I don't have a clue , anyway .\nProject Manager:Mm , mm .\nMarketing:Um what's next ? Looks like {disfmarker} oh no that's not um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What do you guys think of the pens ?\nMarketing:It's quite {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It asks about that .\nIndustrial Designer:They're pretty cool .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:I wanna s\nIndustrial Designer:They're kinda hard to write with though .\nProject Manager:Yeah\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and I I've f forgotten once or twice to {vocalsound} check the box . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:But even so , I dunno .\nProject Manager:And new ideas found ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah it's all very new ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:no ? It's all very new .\nUser Interface:Yeah I think I'd like to um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I dunno . Like it was {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Sorry .\nUser Interface:I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're {disfmarker} like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah . Well they drop off if you like move too much .\nUser Interface:Yeah I dunno . But they're they're okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . Maybe we are .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Uh I think , and I think that uh all this technology like {disfmarker} I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company ,\nUser Interface:or like {disfmarker} I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . Like usually I missed meetings deliberately .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:There's just {disfmarker} there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's mostly like rehashing old stuff .\nUser Interface:Hm .\nIndustrial Designer:And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's like the {disfmarker} there's just really not a lot of information that goes through .\nProject Manager:Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration .\nIndustrial Designer:It seems like way overkill .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I guess it would be {disfmarker} it's gotta be worth it to {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . How about a p {vocalsound} a {gap} {vocalsound} ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um I dunno .\nProject Manager:Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Any other ideas for {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What what's the end ? Are we are we supposed to um {disfmarker} you supposed to write a report ? Or we ending ?\nProject Manager:Um we still have time if there's any other input .\nMarketing:Is that the end ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I mean the {disfmarker} I think we did really well personally , which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly . 'Cause I mean we've all {disfmarker} we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So . Um .\nMarketing:End of meeting . You have to tell her , she {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So I think that's all for today . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay we have to fill in all this stuff .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} M meeting adjourned .\nMarketing:Stuff stuff stuff .\nProject Manager:Meeting adjourned .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I think it would be a good idea , I like it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . Especially if you have food .\nProject Manager:So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . 'Cause {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:All of us ?\nProject Manager:I don't know . Hmm .\nMarketing:Well there's al eight , nine .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ooh . Oh ooh .\nProject Manager:Hmm . Or is that just me ? {vocalsound}\n", "summary": "Project Manager initiated the meeting topic on the detailed design.

One was rehearse your i i talk {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Oh yes , and that too .\nGrad C:Not {disfmarker} not rehearse , I mean , I have just not spent any time on it , so I can show you what I 've got , get your input on it , and maybe some suggestions , that would be great . And the same is true for the proposal . I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains . So , um .

He sent it . OK . You can keep it .\nGrad D:Er , actually , my only copy , now that I think about it ,\nGrad F:Alrigh\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad C:Um , I don't {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker} I don't need it .\nGrad D:but . I already read half of it , so it 's OK .\nGrad C:Um , actually this is the {disfmarker} the newest version after your comments ,\nGrad F:OK .\nGrad C:and {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:Yep .\nGrad D:Oh , maybe the version I didn't have that I {disfmarker} mine {disfmarker} the w did the one you sent on the email have the {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad D:That was the most recent one ?\nProfessor E:Uh , yeah , I think so .\nGrad C:Yep .\nGrad D:OK . Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing .\nGrad A:I 'm changing this . Just so you know .\nGrad C:Yeah ,\nGrad A:But , anyway .\nGrad C:um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d\nGrad A:Oh . Oh , sorry . OK . Sorry .\nGrad C:current formalism thing that you presented .\nGrad A:OK . I will . OK . OK . OK .\nGrad C:But for this it doesn't matter . But , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad A:We can talk about it later . That 's not even ready , so . Um , OK ! Go on t to , uh , whatever .\nGrad C:And {disfmarker}\nGrad A:I 'm making changes . \" Don't worry about that . \" OK . Mmm - mmm . Oh ! OK , sorry , go on .\nGrad C:And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:readability {disfmarker}\nGrad F:There 's only one \" S \" in \" interesting \" .\nGrad C:Hmm ?\nGrad F:There 's only one \" S \" in \" interesting \" . On page five .\nGrad C:Interesting .\nGrad A:Anyway . And y uh , email any time , but most usefully before {disfmarker}\nGrad D:The twenty - first I 'm assuming .\nGrad A:The twenty - first ?\nGrad C:Twenty - ninth .\nProfessor E:No , this is the twenty - first .\nGrad F:That 's {disfmarker}\nGrad D:What , today 's the twenty - first ?\nGrad F:Well , better hurry up then !\nGrad D:Oh , man !\nGrad A:Before the twenty - ninth ,\nGrad C:The twenty - ninth .\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad C:That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea .\nGrad A:Mm - hmm . OK .\nGrad C:OK ? Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here and so of course , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning {disfmarker} The Cave Forty - Five is a {disfmarker} is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that {disfmarker} that time . And so\nGrad F:OK .\nGrad C:they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? Uh , which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . And so forth . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine {disfmarker} nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . Um , {vocalsound} and so forth and so forth . That 's sort of motivating it . Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , um , um , SmartKom stuff , that we did , um , everth\nGrad F:Oh , you 've got the parser done . Sorry .\nGrad C:That 's the {disfmarker} not the construction parser . That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser ,\nGrad F:OK .\nGrad A:Easy parser .\nGrad F:OK .\nGrad C:and the generation outputter .\nGrad D:Halfway done ? Yeah .\nGrad C:That 's done .\nGrad A:Mmm .\nGrad C:You have to change those strategies ,\nGrad D:OK .\nGrad C:right ? That 's , ten words ?\nGrad D:Yeah . Well , i it , you know . Maybe twelve .\nGrad C:Twelve ? OK . And , um , and Fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak . That 's all about that . Then I 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about {disfmarker} uh , actually I have an example , probably . Two s Can you hear that ? Or should I turn the l volume on .\nGrad F:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:I could hear it .\nGrad D:I I can hear it .\nGrad F:I heard it .\nGrad D:They might not hear it in the {disfmarker} well maybe they will . I don't know .\nGrad A:This was an actual , um , subject ? Ah .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nGrad F:Sounds like Fey .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:But they 're {disfmarker} they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer ,\nGrad F:Oh , OK .\nGrad C:the {disfmarker} you can observe that all the time , they 're trying to match their prosody onto the machine .\nGrad F:Oh really . Interesting . Oh , it 's pretty slow .\nGrad C:Yeah , you have to {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Wh\nGrad F:The system breaking .\nGrad A:What is the s ? Oh !\nGrad C:OK . And so forth and so forth . Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um , I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , but I thought it would interesting to , uh , um , point out that it 's basically the same . Um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from , uh , some first , uh , observations . Then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz , uh {disfmarker} how to get there , what actually is happening there today , and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit {disfmarker} as much as I {pause} can about the NTL story . I {disfmarker} I wa I do wanna , um {disfmarker} I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in , um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are {disfmarker} or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , and then , {vocalsound} talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude , I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy . And , um , Srini was gonna send me some slides but he didn't do it , so from {disfmarker} but I have the paper , I can make a resume of that , and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think .\nGrad A:Oh . I was like , \" where 'd you get that ? \" OK .\nGrad F:Yeah , that looks familiar .\nGrad A:\" Looks familiar . \"\nGrad C:I think that 's Bergen , Chang , something , or the other .\nGrad A:Uh .\nProfessor E:Whatever .\nGrad A:OK .\nGrad C:Um , and that 's {disfmarker} now I 'm not going to bring that . So that 's basically what I have , so far , and the rest is for airplanes . So X - schemas , then , I would like to do {disfmarker} talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes - net .\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:End of story . Anything I forgot that we should mention ? Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . Should I mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started {disfmarker} going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ?\nProfessor E:You certainly can . I mean I y I you know , I don't know {disfmarker}\nGrad A:You might just wanna like , tack that on , as a comment , to something .\nProfessor E:Right , um .\nGrad C:\" Future activities \" something .\nProfessor E:Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:and , you know , the {disfmarker} yeah , yeah {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} that the plan is to see to what extent the {disfmarker} you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , so that {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:and that we 're planning to do this , um , which , we are . So that 's one thing . Um . Depends . I mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , OK ?\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:which , uh , actually , i i even on your five - layer slide , you {disfmarker} you 've got an old one that {disfmarker} that leaves that off .\nGrad C:Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do have it here .\nGrad A:Hmm .\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad C:Um . And , of course , you know , the {disfmarker} the big picture is this bit .\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad C:But , you know , it would {disfmarker} But I don't think I {disfmarker} I am capable of {disfmarker} of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism story would be nice to be {disfmarker} you know , it would be nice to tell people how {disfmarker} what 's happening there , plus how the , uh , language learning stuff works ,\nProfessor E:OK , so , so anyway , I {disfmarker} I agree that 's not central .\nGrad C:but {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:What you might wanna do is , um , and may not , but you might wanna {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} rip off a bunch of the slides on the anal there {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , and , um , how the construction and simulation {disfmarker} that ho that whole th\nGrad C:Yeah , th that {disfmarker} that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide ,\nGrad A:OK , right .\nGrad C:so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy ,\nGrad A:OK , I can give you a more recent {disfmarker} if you want {disfmarker}\nGrad C:one of Nancy 's st\nGrad A:well , that might have enough .\nGrad C:Uh , I {disfmarker} yeah , but I also have stuff you {disfmarker} trash you left over ,\nProfessor E:OK .\nGrad C:your quals and your triple - AI .\nProfessor E:The quals w the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the quals slides would be fine .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nProfessor E:You could get it out of there , or some\nGrad A:Which I can even email you then , you know , like there probably was a little {disfmarker} few changes , not a big deal . Yeah , you could steal anything you want , I don't care . Which you 've already done , obviously . So . Sorry\nGrad C:Well , I {disfmarker} I don't feel bad about it at all\nGrad A:No , you shouldn't .\nGrad C:because {disfmarker} because you are on the , uh , title .\nGrad A:Oh , that 's great , that 's great .\nGrad C:I mean on the {disfmarker} the , you 're {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} see , that 's you .\nGrad A:I 'm glad to see propagation .\nProfessor E:Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad A:Mmm .\nGrad C:Hmm ? Propagated ?\nGrad A:Yes .\nGrad C:I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , so .\nGrad A:It 's {disfmarker} it 's certainly related , um ,\nGrad C:Because , um , EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig .\nGrad A:might wanna say . Is it ?\nGrad C:So it {disfmarker} It 's on biocomputation . Would {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Yeah , it 's different , this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad A:Kind of a different level of analysis .\nProfessor E:The {disfmarker} yeah it was {disfmarker} it turns out that if {disfmarker} if you have multiple billions of dollars , y you can do all sorts of weird things , and {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Wait , they 're building a building in the shape of DNA ,\nGrad A:What ?\nGrad D:is that what you said ?\nProfessor E:Roughly , yeah .\nGrad F:Oh ! Oh boy !\nGrad A:O\nProfessor E:Including cr cross - bridges ,\nGrad A:What ?\nProfessor E:and\nGrad A:Oh my god !\nGrad F:That 's brilliant ! Hhh .\nProfessor E:You d you really {disfmarker} now I I spent {disfmarker} the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story which is , um {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Of what\nGrad D:Y You definitely wanna w don't wanna waste that money on research ,\nGrad A:the building ?\nGrad D:you know ?\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad D:That 's horrible .\nProfessor E:Right . Well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money . See you th you th you then fill it with researchers .\nGrad A:And give them more money . They just want a fun place for them to {disfmarker} to work .\nProfessor E:Right . Right .\nGrad F:And everybody gets a trampoline in their office .\nGrad C:Well , the {disfmarker} the offices are actually a little {disfmarker} the , think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes , and the offices are in {disfmarker} in the glass half - dome .\nGrad A:Really ?\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad F:Alright , let 's stop talking about this .\nGrad A:Does it exist yet ?\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad A:They are w now building it ?\nGrad C:Uh , as a model .\nGrad A:Hmm .\nGrad C:But I th\nProfessor E:So , yeah , I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , uh , a lot of the {disfmarker} this is interacting with , uh , people in Italy but also definitely the people in Leipzig and the {disfmarker} the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah . OK . OK . Anyway ! Enough of that , let 's talk about your thesis proposal .\nGrad C:Yeah , if somebody has something to say .\nProfessor E:Yep .\nGrad F:You might want to , uh , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , you had a few , uh , misspells in your slides , there . Like I believe you had \" Jackendorf \" .\nProfessor E:Um .\nGrad F:Uh , unless there 's a person called \" Jackendorf \" ,\nGrad A:On that one ?\nProfessor E:No , no , no .\nGrad F:yeah . But that 's the only thing I noticed in there .\nGrad A:In the presentation ?\nGrad F:In the presentation .\nGrad A:I 'll probably {disfmarker} I c might have {disfmarker} I 'll probably have comments for you separately , not important . Anyway .\nGrad C:Oh , in the presentation here .\nGrad A:Yeah , that 's what he was talking about .\nGrad F:Yeah .\nGrad C:I was ac actually worried about bibtex . Uh . No , that 's quite possible . That 's copy and paste from something .\nProfessor E:So I did note i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet .\nGrad C:Uh , it did , there is a reference to Srini {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place {disfmarker} Oh , did you put in something about ,\nGrad A:Metonymy and metaphor here , right ?\nProfessor E:uh , the individual , we 'd talked about putting in something about people had , uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah , OK . Good . I see where you have it . So the top of the second {disfmarker} of pa page two you have a sentence .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , uh , you should , unless you put it in the text , and I don't think it 's there yet , about {disfmarker} we talked about is the , um , scalability that you get by , um , combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism . Is that in there ?\nGrad C:Yeah , mmm . Um .\nProfessor E:Uh , OK , so where {disfmarker} where is it , cuz I 'll have to take a look .\nGrad C:Um , but I {disfmarker} I did not focus on that aspect but , um {disfmarker} Ehhh , um , it 's just underneath , uh , um , that reference to metaphor . So it 's the last paragraph before two . So on page two , um , the main focus {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Uh , OK . Yeah .\nGrad C:But that 's really {disfmarker}\nGrad A:That 's not about that , is it ?\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:No , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it s says it but it doesn't say {disfmarker} it doesn't {disfmarker} it d it d\nGrad C:Why .\nProfessor E:yeah , it doesn't give the punch line .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is , because it 's actually important , which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general but cover only base cases . And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at {disfmarker} at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work .\nGrad F:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions .\nGrad F:Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nProfessor E:And it {disfmarker} to the extent that that 's true then {disfmarker} then it 's a big win over anything that exists .\nGrad D:So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them .\nGrad F:Yeah .\nProfessor E:Mm - hmm . So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal and any metaphorical one {disfmarker} and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff {comment} {disfmarker} you can do the same grammar .\nGrad D:Mmm .\nProfessor E:And it is the same grammar . But , um , the trick is that the {disfmarker} the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container . Well , \" trouble \" isn't a container , but it gets constr construed as a c container .\nGrad D:Right .\nProfessor E:Et cetera . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's where this , um ,\nGrad D:So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule .\nProfessor E:Right . So 's it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't , um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could .\nGrad C:No , it doesn't say it at all . No . Even though {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One could argue what {disfmarker} if there are basic cases , even . I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free .\nProfessor E:Oh , nothing is context - free , but there are basic cases . That is , um , there are physical containers , there are physical paths , there {disfmarker} you know , et cetera .\nGrad C:But \" walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , \" and \" walked into the cafe and broke his nose , \" that 's sort of {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous .\nGrad C:Mmm . Yeah .\nProfessor E:I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as {disfmarker} as a obstacle ,\nGrad F:Uh - huh .\nProfessor E:or as some physical object . So there are multiple construals . And in fact that 's part of what has to be done . This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm . Yep .\nProfessor E:The b the {disfmarker} the double arrow .\nGrad C:Yep .\nProfessor E:So , uh , yeah , I mean , it doesn't magically make ambiguity go away .\nGrad C:No .\nProfessor E:But it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:And if that 's not consistent with other things , then you 've gotta reject that reading .\nGrad C:Yep .\nGrad D:You con {disfmarker} you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so I thought , \" Why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose ? \" uh , oh , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F:He slipped on the wet floor .\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad C:You don't find that usage , uh {disfmarker} uh , I checked for it in the Brown national corpus .\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad C:The \" walk into it \" never really means , w as in walked smack {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:But \" run into \" does .\nGrad C:Yeah , but , y y if you find \" walked smacked into the cafe \" or \" slammed into the wall \" {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Yeah , no , but \" run into \" does .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:Because you will find \" run into , \" uh ,\nGrad D:Cars run into telephone poles all the time .\nProfessor E:well , or \" into the cafe \" for that m\nGrad C:Right .\nProfessor E:you know {disfmarker} \" His car ran into the cafe . \"\nGrad C:Yeah . Or you can run into an old friend , or run .\nProfessor E:Well , you can \" run into \" in that sense too .\nGrad A:Yeah , \" run into \" might even be more impact sense than , you know , container sense .\nProfessor E:But , uh , Right .\nGrad F:Depends .\nProfessor E:But {disfmarker} Like , \" run into an old friend \" , it probably needs its own construction . I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else\nGrad A:Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:and maybe it is , but , um , there are idioms and my guess is that 's one of them , but , um {disfmarker} I don't know .\nGrad A:All contact . I mean , there there 's contact that doesn't {disfmarker} social contact , whatever . I mean .\nProfessor E:Uh .\nGrad F:Sudden surprising contact ,\nProfessor E:Yeah , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} Right . i Yeah , it 's more {disfmarker}\nGrad F:right ?\nGrad A:Forceful .\nGrad F:But of course , no , i i I mean it has a life of its own . It 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Well , this is this motivated {disfmarker} but yeah {disfmarker}\nGrad F:Yeah .\nProfessor E:oh yeah , mo for sure , motivated , but then you can't parse on motivated .\nGrad F:Yeah . Yeah . Right .\nProfessor E:Uh ,\nGrad A:Too bad .\nGrad D:You should get a T - shirt that says that .\nProfessor E:OK .\nGrad A:There 's {disfmarker} there 's lots of things you could make T - shirts out of , but , uh , this has gotten {disfmarker} I mean wh We don't need the words to that .\nGrad C:Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen , today .\nGrad A:What ? Oh , no no no no no no no no no , we 're not going there .\nGrad C:Not {disfmarker} not your marks .\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor E:OK , so , um ,\nGrad F:In other news .\nProfessor E:anything else you want to ask us about the thesis proposal , you got {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Well ,\nProfessor E:We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it .\nGrad C:Well there {disfmarker} actually {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this , uh , from our domain . So maybe if we w if we can make one up {pause} now , that would be c incredibly helpful .\nGrad A:So , w where it should illustrate\nProfessor E:OK .\nGrad A:uh {disfmarker} wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , I don't know , the related work stuff ,\nGrad C:How {disfmarker}\nGrad A:as well as , mappings ?\nGrad C:w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something\nProfessor E:Right {disfmarker} right {disfmarker} r\nGrad C:and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we {disfmarker} we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the {disfmarker} to the domain .\nProfessor E:OK , f let 's {disfmarker} let 's suppose you use \" in \" and \" on \" . I mean , that 's what you started with .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:So \" in the bus \" and \" on the bus , \" um , that 's actually a little tricky in English because to some extent they 're synonyms . OK .\nGrad C:I had two hours w with George on this , so it ,\nProfessor E:OK , what did he say .\nGrad A:Did you ?\nGrad C:um {disfmarker} Um .\nGrad A:Join the club .\nProfessor E:Right . Oh , h that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad C:\" On the bus \" is a m is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on {disfmarker} on that path and th w I mean it 's {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} there 's a platform notion ,\nProfessor E:Yeah , I {disfmarker} I believe all that , it 's just {disfmarker}\nGrad C:right ? \" he 's on the {disfmarker} standing on the bus waving to me . \"\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad C:But th the regular as we speak \" J Johno was on the bus to New York , \"\nProfessor E:Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad C:um , uh , he 's {disfmarker} that 's , uh , what did I call it here , the transportation schema , something ,\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad C:where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight ,\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad C:and you can be , you know , on the wagon .\nProfessor E:Right . So {disfmarker} so that {disfmarker} that may or may not be what you {disfmarker} what you want to do . I mean you could do something much simpler\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:like \" under the bus , \" or something , where {disfmarker}\nGrad C:But it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say . So .\nProfessor E:Well , unless he was repairing it or something ,\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:but yeah .\nGrad C:But um .\nProfessor E:Uh , but OK .\nGrad C:So in terms of the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker}\nGrad A:I see .\nGrad C:We had {disfmarker} we had {disfmarker} initially we 'd {disfmarker} started discussing the \" out of film . \"\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad C:And there 's a lot of \" out of \" analysis , so , um ,\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad C:could we capture that with a different construal of {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Yeah , it 's a little {disfmarker} it 's , uh {disfmarker} we 've thought about it before , uh t uh {disfmarker} to use the examples in other papers , and it 's {disfmarker} it 's a little complicated . Cuz you 're like , it 's a state of {disfmarker} there 's resource ,\nGrad F:Out of {disfmarker} out of film , in particular .\nGrad A:right , and like , what is film ,\nGrad F:Yeah .\nGrad A:the state {disfmarker} you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource .\nGrad F:It 's {disfmarker}\nGrad A:I mean .\nGrad F:yeah , I mean ,\nGrad A:It 's a little bit {disfmarker}\nGrad F:but {disfmarker} and plus the fact that there 's also s I mean , can you say , like , \" The film ran out \" you know , or , maybe you could say something like \" The film is out \"\nGrad A:Yeah , is film the trajector ?\nGrad F:so like the {disfmarker} the film went away from where it should be , namely with you , or something , right ? You know . The {disfmarker} the film {disfmarker} the film is gone , right ? Um , I never really knew what was going on , I mean I {disfmarker} I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that {disfmarker} that \" I 'm out of film \" means that I have left the state of having film or something like that ,\nGrad A:It 's weird . That {disfmarker}\nGrad F:but .\nGrad A:Or , \" having \" is also , um , associated with location ,\nProfessor E:Uh .\nGrad A:right ?\nGrad F:Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad A:so if the film left , you know {disfmarker} state is being near film .\nGrad C:So running {disfmarker} running out of something is different from being out of somewhere .\nProfessor E:Or being out of something as , uh {disfmarker} as well . So \" running out of it \" definitely has a process aspect to it .\nGrad A:Mm - hmm . But that 's from run , yeah .\nProfessor E:So ,\nGrad F:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:b that 's OK ,\nGrad A:Yeah .\nProfessor E:I mean {disfmarker} b but the difference\nGrad C:Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it .\nProfessor E:is {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Yeah . So th\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad F:Yeah . You got there .\nGrad A:That part is fine .\nGrad F:You got to out of it .\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad F:Yeah .\nProfessor E:But , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F:Hmm !\nProfessor E:Yeah , so {disfmarker} so nob so no one has in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} of the , uh , professional linguists ,\nGrad A:Uh .\nProfessor E:they haven't {disfmarker} there was this whole thesis on \" out of \" .\nGrad A:There was ? Who ?\nProfessor E:Well , there {disfmarker} I thought {disfmarker} or there was a paper on it .\nGrad F:Out .\nProfessor E:Huh ?\nGrad F:There was one on {disfmarker} on \" out \" or \" out of \" ?\nProfessor E:There was a Well , it may be just \" out \" . Yeah .\nGrad F:OK .\nProfessor E:I think there was \" over \" but there was also a paper on \" out \" .\nGrad F:Yeah , Lind - Susan Lindner ,\nGrad A:Oh , yeah , you 're right . Yeah .\nProfessor E:Or something .\nGrad F:right ? The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} \" the syrup spread out \" ?\nProfessor E:Yeah , and all that sort of stuff .\nGrad F:That kind of thing ?\nGrad A:Yeah . And undoubtably there 's been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics ,\nProfessor E:OK . But anyway . We 're not gonna do that between now and next week .\nGrad A:but . Yeah .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:OK . So , um {disfmarker}\nGrad A:It 's not one of the y it 's more straightforward ones {disfmarker} forward ones to defend , so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad A:th these are {disfmarker} you 're addressing like , computational linguists ,\nProfessor E:OK .\nGrad A:right . Or {disfmarker} are you ?\nGrad C:There 's gonna be four computational linguists ,\nGrad A:OK . But more emphasis on the computational ? Or emphasis on the linguist ?\nGrad C:computer it 's {disfmarker} More {disfmarker} there 's going to be the {disfmarker} just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists .\nGrad A:Oh , OK .\nProfessor E:No no no , but not for your talk . I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes\nGrad C:Oh , the thesis !\nGrad A:Oh , I meant this ,\nProfessor E:it 's just for one guy .\nGrad C:That 's {disfmarker} that 's computa should be very computational ,\nGrad A:you know , like {disfmarker} OK . So I would try to {disfmarker} I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff .\nGrad C:and , uh , someth\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad F:Yeah .\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad A:You know , it 's an obvious one {disfmarker}\nGrad F:Totally weird stuff .\nGrad C:I mean the {disfmarker} the old bakery example might be nice ,\nGrad A:but , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad C:\" Is there a bakery around here \" . So if you c we really just construe it as a {disfmarker}\nGrad F:Yeah .\nGrad A:Around ?\nGrad C:No , it 's the bakery itself {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Oh .\nGrad C:is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ?\nGrad A:Oh , oh yeah . Yeah , we 've thought about that . Right . Right .\nGrad C:And then {disfmarker}\nGrad A:Nnn . No . What ? \" Bakery \" can't be something you 're gonna eat .\nProfessor E:No , no . The question is d do you wanna {disfmarker} do you wanna construe {disfmarker} do you wanna constr - strue\nGrad F:Sh\nGrad D:It 's a speech - act .\nProfessor E:r Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} i for example , if {disfmarker} y\nGrad A:Yeah . Where you can get baked goods .\nProfessor E:Well th well , that 's one . You want to buy something . But the other is , uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or ,\nGrad F:Mm - hmm .\nProfessor E:um , pfff you know , you wonder how people here make their living , and {disfmarker} there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery\nGrad F:Yeah .\nProfessor E:that doesn't mean , \" I want to buy some baked goods . \"\nGrad A:OK .\nProfessor E:But {vocalsound} um , those are interesting examples but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples .\nGrad A:So it 's a lot of pragmatics , there , that\nGrad F:Yeah .\nGrad C:Mmm .\nProfessor E:There 's all sorts of stuff going on .\nGrad A:might be beyond what you want to do .\nProfessor E:So let 's {disfmarker} so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal . So let 's first do a {disfmarker} So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a and actually the {disfmarker} Though , the one you have isn't quite {disfmarker}\nGrad A:You mean the s You mean \" the steak wants to pay \" ?\nProfessor E:N no not that one , that 's {disfmarker} that 's a {disfmarker} the sort of background . This is the t uh , page five .\nGrad D:About Plato and the book ?\nGrad A:Oh .\nProfessor E:No .\nGrad A:Um .\nGrad C:No .\nGrad A:How much does it cost ?\nProfessor E:Just beyond that .\nGrad F:Onward .\nGrad C:Where is the castle ?\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad F:A castle .\nGrad C:How old is it ? How much does it cost ?\nGrad D:Oh .\nGrad F:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:To go in , that 's like {disfmarker}\nGrad F:Two hundred million dollars .\nProfessor E:Right . It 's not for sale . Uh . So\nGrad F:Yeah , I think that 's a good example , actually .\nGrad C:S\nGrad A:Yeah , that 's good . u\nGrad C:But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus .\nGrad A:Ellipsis .\nGrad C:Huh .\nGrad A:Like , \" it \" doesn't refer to \" thing , \" it refers to acti you know , j thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist {disfmarker} you could think of it that way , but .\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad F:Well , shoot , isn't that {disfmarker} I mean , that 's what {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Well , I mean , my argument here is {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's the same thing as \" Plato 's on the top shelf , \"\nGrad F:figuring that out is what this is about .\nGrad A:Yeah , yeah , no , I I agree .\nGrad C:I 'm con you know , th that you can refer to a book of Plato by using \" Plato , \"\nGrad A:Yeah . No no , I {disfmarker} I 'm agreeing that this is a good , um {disfmarker}\nGrad C:and you can refer back to it , and so you can {disfmarker} Castles have {disfmarker} as tourist sites , have admission fees , so you can say \" Where is the castle , how much does it cost ? \" Um . \" How far is it from here ? \"\nGrad F:Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:So , You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so ,\nGrad A:Hmm . Mm - hmm .\nGrad C:www .\nGrad F:Mmm .\nProfessor E:OK . Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of \" where \" in the tourist 's domain ? Um .\nGrad F:Hmm .\nProfessor E:So you know it 's {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you can sometimes use \" where \" f for \" when \"\nGrad F:O\nProfessor E:in the sense of , you know , um , where {disfmarker} wh where {disfmarker} where was , um , \" where was Heidelberg , um , in the Thirty Years ' War ? \" Or something .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nGrad F:Uh , yeah .\nProfessor E:You know , or some such thing . Um .\nGrad F:Like what side were they on ,\nGrad A:What ?\nProfessor E:Yeah . Essentially , yeah .\nGrad F:or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad A:OK . I was like , \" Huh ? It was here . \" Like {disfmarker} {comment} Um .\nProfessor E:But anyway th so there are {disfmarker} there are cases like that . Um ,\nGrad A:Ah ! Or like its developmental state or something like that , you could {disfmarker} I guess you could get that .\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad A:Um .\nProfessor E:Um .\nGrad F:I mean , there 's also things like {disfmarker} I mean , s um , I guess I could ask something like \" Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah \" in a sort of {disfmarker} doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location , just give me a phone number\nProfessor E:Yeah . There certainly is that , yeah .\nGrad F:and I 'll call them or something like that ?\nProfessor E:You know , \" Where could I learn its opening hours , \" or something .\nGrad F:Yeah .\nProfessor E:But that 's not metaphorical .\nGrad A:Hmm .\nProfessor E:It 's another {disfmarker}\nGrad F:Yeah .\nProfessor E:So we 're thinking about , um , or we could also think about , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Well , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:How about \" I 'm in a hurry \" ?\nGrad A:State .\nProfessor E:It i But it 's a state {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} the issue is , is that {disfmarker} it may be just a usage ,\nGrad F:Hmm ?\nProfessor E:you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , I don't know .\nGrad F:Mmm .\nGrad A:Right . So you want a more exotic one {disfmarker} version of that .\nGrad F:Oh .\nProfessor E:Yeah . Yeah , right .\nGrad A:I 'm really into {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Ah ! How about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you know , \" I 'm in {disfmarker} I 'm in a state of exhaustion \" ?\nGrad A:Do you really say that ?\nProfessor E:or something like that , which a tourist w Huh ?\nGrad A:Would you really say that ?\nProfessor E:A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , \" I 'm in overload . \" Tu - stur tourists will often say that .\nGrad F:Yeah .\nGrad D:I I 'm really into art .\nGrad A:Yeah , I was gonna say , like {disfmarker}\nGrad D:Uh {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Oh , you can do that ? Really ? Of course that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's definitely a , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F:Fixed .\nGrad A:A fixed expression , yeah .\nProfessor E:that 's a , uh {disfmarker} Right . But . {disfmarker}\nGrad A:There 're too {disfmarker} there 're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't {disfmarker} like uh \" I 'm out of sorts now ! \"\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad A:Like {comment} \" I 'm in trouble ! \"\nGrad C:Well I {disfmarker} when , uh {disfmarker} just f u the data that I 've looked at so far that rec\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad C:I mean , there 's tons of cases for polysemy .\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad A:Uh - huh .\nGrad C:So , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build\nProfessor E:Right .\nGrad C:you know , whatever . Um , so ib in mus for example , in museums , you know , as a building or as something where pictures hang versus , you know , ev something that puts on exhibits , so forth .\nProfessor E:Right . As an institution ,\nGrad C:But {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:yeah .\nGrad C:Um .\nGrad A:Why don't you want to use any of those ?\nGrad C:Hmm ?\nGrad A:So y you don't wanna use one that 's {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Yeah , well {disfmarker} No , but this {disfmarker} that 's what I have , you know , started doing .\nProfessor E:The castle {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that old castle one is sort of {disfmarker}\nGrad C:Metonymy , polysemy .\nGrad D:I love Van Gogh .\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad A:\" I wanna go see the Van Gogh . \"\nProfessor E:Ah !\nGrad F:Oh geez .\nGrad A:Anyway , I 'm sorry .\nGrad C:But I think the argument should be {disfmarker} uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical ,\nProfessor E:Yeah .\nGrad C:construal still is , uh , you know , completely , um , key in terms of finding out any of these things , so , um .\nProfessor E:Right . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's a {disfmarker} that 's a reasonable point , that it {disfmarker} in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy .\nGrad C:We , uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} I looked {disfmarker} with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy .\nProfessor E:And polysemy , and stuff like that . Yeah .\nGrad C:Hardly anything . So not even in descriptions w did we find anything , um , relevant .\nGrad F:I have to go .\nProfessor E:Alright . Yeah .\nGrad C:But OK this is just something we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll see , um ,\nProfessor E:Right . s See you .\nGrad C:and deal with .\nProfessor E:OK , well . I guess if anybody has additional suggestions ,\nGrad C:I mean maybe the \" where is something \" question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request .\nProfessor E:w Yeah .\nGrad C:So , if we 're not talk about the lexic\nGrad A:Location versus what ?\nGrad C:instruction .\nGrad A:Instruction . Oh , directions ? Yeah .\nProfessor E:Sure .\nGrad A:Oh , I thought that was {disfmarker} definitely treated as an example of construal .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nGrad A:Right ?\nGrad C:Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level , that 's sort of one level higher .\nGrad A:Oh , you want a lexical example .\nGrad C:But I don't need it .\nProfessor E:Well , you might want both .\nGrad C:Mm - hmm .\nGrad A:Yeah .\nGrad C:Also it would be nice to get {disfmarker} ultimately to get a nice mental space example ,\nProfessor E:We {disfmarker}\nGrad C:so , even temporal references are {disfmarker} just in the spatial domain are rare .\nProfessor E:But it 's {disfmarker} it 's easy to make up plausible ones .\nGrad C:When {disfmarker} when you 're getting information on objects .\nProfessor E:You know .\nGrad C:So , I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor E:Right , you know {disfmarker} you know , where r Yeah . What color was this in {disfmarker} in in the nain nineteenth century .\nGrad C:Yeah .\nProfessor E:What was this p instead of {disfmarker} wh what {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} how was this painted , what color was this painted , um , was this alleyway open .\nGrad C:Yeah , maybe we can include that also in our second , uh , data run .\nProfessor E:Uh .\nGrad C:We c we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth .\nProfessor E:Mm - hmm . OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically . Wish you a good trip . All success .\nGrad D:For some reason when you said \" feedback electronically \" I thought of that {disfmarker} you ever see the Simpsons where they 're {disfmarker} like the family 's got the buzzers and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying ?\nGrad A:Yeah . That 's the {disfmarker} first one , I think . The very very first one .\nGrad D:It was a very early one . I don't know if it 's the first one .\nGrad A:Mmm . Mmm .\n", "summary": "The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy. Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: \"walk/run into\", \"on the bus\", \"out of film\", \"where is X?\". However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.", "length": 14964},
{"id": 24, "conversations": "Project Manager:{vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:as the previous meeting I will be the secretary\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No y you do the minutes first , or ?\nProject Manager:What ?\nMarketing:No ?\nProject Manager:I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:So , we'll {disfmarker} S\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:technical accessoire ?\nUser Interface:No no no .\nProject Manager:Interface ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:This .\nUser Interface:Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:A nice one .\nUser Interface:attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's very big ,\nUser Interface:if you're {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface:yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , why not . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:so .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .\nProject Manager:Okay . Something else ?\nUser Interface:Okay . No . There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?\nUser Interface:Y\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager:or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?\nUser Interface:Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .\nProject Manager:Yeah , sure .\nUser Interface:For example , if you cannot find your uh {vocalsound} controller , you can just uh {vocalsound} just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .\nProject Manager:I\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , {vocalsound} that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good point , so .\nProject Manager:That's true . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:One and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah but how how is {disfmarker} how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?\nProject Manager:Broken arm ?\nUser Interface:For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yep . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:But this this {disfmarker} but this would never happen anyway .\nProject Manager:Why ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .\nProject Manager:If you have one brother and one sister\nMarketing:Yeah {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme ,\nMarketing:Yeah , but the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} Yeah\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's very interesting . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah but this {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so .\nIndustrial Designer:but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nMarketing:I don't think it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} That's right .\nProject Manager:You're not you're not obliged to share it .\nMarketing:Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .\nProject Manager:Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:so it's c come to channel three ,\nMarketing:No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .\nUser Interface:I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .\nUser Interface:It's advantage .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to\nProject Manager:Yeah , but one other question .\nIndustrial Designer:manual controllers , eh .\nProject Manager:How how much will it cost ?\nIndustrial Designer:No , more expensive maybe .\nUser Interface:How much ?\nProject Manager:Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .\nUser Interface:No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Some some efficient .\nMarketing:Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .\nProject Manager:So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ? Or ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:it's uh {disfmarker} yeah . It's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh {disfmarker} I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .\nIndustrial Designer:Well y y you have also the language problem ,\nUser Interface:No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:you know when you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer:'Cause it it have to be universal ,\nProject Manager:Yeah . I agree with uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nUser Interface:The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so .\nUser Interface:Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation\nMarketing:Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but you know . The product {disfmarker} The pro\nUser Interface:mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm , okay .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nProject Manager:And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?\nUser Interface:it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but for each country you have to do one ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh really ? {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh .\nMarketing:Yeah ,\nProject Manager:Seems to be quite complex .\nMarketing:but then w Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Comple\nUser Interface:No , it's not so complex {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:we have to take care of the twelve Euros\nProject Manager:And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?\nMarketing:problem .\nProject Manager:And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?\nUser Interface:No no no it's not {disfmarker} I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just {disfmarker} the microphone is embedded in the controller .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but where is the controller ?\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:Where is the controller ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:It's in your family , in your home . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah , but we're {disfmarker}\nMarketing:No , but then it's it's like this uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .\nIndustrial Designer:A microphone maybe .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .\nIndustrial Designer:To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .\nProject Manager:You just want to interact with television .\nUser Interface:Yeah yeah just {disfmarker} you just put the controller here , then you\nIndustrial Designer:I if you say one , he switch to channel ,\nUser Interface:you use your command\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nUser Interface:and you do s your gesture .\nProject Manager:but you can lose it . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:No no it's n y {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you lose it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay you {disfmarker} so you can build a kind of black box\nIndustrial Designer:Devic\nProject Manager:and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone {vocalsound} inside your remote control .\nProject Manager:Ah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:But you would still have the buttons . Or is it {disfmarker} do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?\nUser Interface:think it {disfmarker} we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay , so you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:yeah .\nUser Interface:You can see {disfmarker} they can switch form one modality to another .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .\nProject Manager:I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:No ,\nProject Manager:And maybe it will be quite {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:that's quite inter quite attractive .\nIndustrial Designer:But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y\nUser Interface:Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but i i {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I dunno .\nUser Interface:We should have confidence in technology . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah , we should . {vocalsound} Uh .\nProject Manager:Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:What ?\nProject Manager:Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?\nMarketing:If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .\nUser Interface:More features , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But if if if it like doubles uh\nIndustrial Designer:I think he need a control that is very reliable ,\nMarketing:no one would would be interested .\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nProject Manager:So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ?\nUser Interface:Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . No ,\nUser Interface:Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:It's not really the {disfmarker} we\nMarketing:Y\nIndustrial Designer:we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so {disfmarker} or something like that . But uh I think a user need {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function ,\nMarketing:No ,\nUser Interface:but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,\nIndustrial Designer:Don't have a {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} Yeah\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:if we can send email from it .\nUser Interface:But it's not the {disfmarker} only the problem {disfmarker} only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .\nMarketing:No . No .\nIndustrial Designer:Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Cause for example {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but uh we want so\nUser Interface:but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .\nMarketing:Yeah , you wou you would {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:True .\nUser Interface:the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our {disfmarker} from other products .\nProject Manager:Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And for all the person of the family maybe ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You don't need to tune it .\nIndustrial Designer:so , yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , why not ? If it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I mean , for example the goo y\nIndustrial Designer:Because you have new {disfmarker}\nMarketing:you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is {vocalsound} is simple , works fine ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .\nMarketing:Uh thi this {disfmarker} I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition\nUser Interface:The {disfmarker} then nn\nMarketing:or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:no .\nMarketing:if he has something that works fine and is really {vocalsound} fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .\nUser Interface:Tha\nProject Manager:Not too expensive too .\nUser Interface:But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .\nMarketing:See {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That's the same {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's the problem ,\nUser Interface:yeah .\nMarketing:yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Ye {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and so .\nProject Manager:Okay . So\nMarketing:I mean , that's the point .\nProject Manager:let's go to the Industrial Designer .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Two ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , participant two um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Working ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , working design ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I can {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Can you go to the {vocalsound} next one ? I uh {disfmarker} it's not this one .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:It's uh oth the oth {vocalsound} so I {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:It's the working design . Sorry . {vocalsound} Component design .\nProject Manager:It's okay {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So this yeah {disfmarker} so this is the described use {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:What ? Are you inst\nProject Manager:Uh I think there's something wrong with your {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .\nProject Manager:Maybe you you record it somewhere else .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't think so .\nUser Interface:Participant one . Participant one .\nProject Manager:Interface concept . No .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the {disfmarker} Computer .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh . {vocalsound} Nope . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , okay . Yes .\nProject Manager:It seems that we have a problem with the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I dunno if you remember what you had to say or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I can say it to you without .\nProject Manager:Yeah , so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , maybe we can first come to\nProject Manager:No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides ,\nMarketing:I think it's more interesting what he says ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface:then present it later .\nMarketing:okay .\nIndustrial Designer:exac\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:You will had s some more information in {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , true .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:In fact , I don't know ,\nProject Manager:So . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , never mind .\nIndustrial Designer:so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .\nProject Manager:and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers\nIndustrial Designer:Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:no ?\nIndustrial Designer:Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,\nProject Manager:So .\nIndustrial Designer:but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so hmm .\nProject Manager:And what tha what about the uh materials ?\nIndustrial Designer:And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common\nProject Manager:Impersonal , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Special for {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:or you know , you can have some {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:and it can be interesting .\nProject Manager:Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .\nIndustrial Designer:And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .\nProject Manager:Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:And you think that we will be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nProject Manager:So wood .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nProject Manager:And what about the buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer:I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion\nProject Manager:No it's fashion , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .\nMarketing:What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So you got email ?\nProject Manager:I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Participant four ? Functional requirements ?\nMarketing:Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:This one ?\nMarketing:Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,\nIndustrial Designer:Ah yes .\nMarketing:okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .\nMarketing:'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris\nIndustrial Designer:And fruit and vegetables yeah .\nMarketing:we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing:okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?\nMarketing:Yeah thi this is this would be like um\nIndustrial Designer:Pla S\nMarketing:plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh\nIndustrial Designer:Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:device , so um\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Solar .\nMarketing:Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:maybe will attract\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm\nIndustrial Designer:It will be a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:pro-ecology consumers .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Case .\nUser Interface:Later ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So you think {gap} case . Something spongy . {vocalsound} Someth no wood .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} No wood but {disfmarker} Plastic ?\nMarketing:Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Would some {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Pla\nProject Manager:Maybe you {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want ,\nMarketing:Yeah , maybe the base .\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nProject Manager:It's it's natural .\nMarketing:But still y\nProject Manager:Th The feeling is natural ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it's natural\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and i\nProject Manager:so maybe we can stay with wood .\nIndustrial Designer:And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol\nMarketing:Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .\nProject Manager:But it's still fashion .\nMarketing:But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:or\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nMarketing:I dunno .\nProject Manager:something that you can {vocalsound} into it .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh and what about the user interface concept ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Google and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Google and fancy ?\nIndustrial Designer:and fancy , f how about the the voice ? {vocalsound} And {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested\nUser Interface:Uh yes .\nIndustrial Designer:and how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It It is an an interesting concept to see {disfmarker} to have uh voice control .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface:The smart controller . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker} and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nProject Manager:but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .\nIndustrial Designer:But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .\nProject Manager:That's true .\nMarketing:Yeah {disfmarker} d\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,\nMarketing:I dunno .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .\nUser Interface:Yeah . It's good .\nProject Manager:And L_C_D_ buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:What interface ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , for the interface something {disfmarker} added value .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the supplement can be the voice {vocalsound} . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .\nProject Manager:Turning the T_V_ o on o or off .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , turning {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,\nProject Manager:So ,\nIndustrial Designer:so .\nProject Manager:adding some vocal commands .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Simple ones ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , simple ones for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} we'll {disfmarker} you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yep . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} expensive buttons {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , to make some new {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .\nMarketing:Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , fruits .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:If possible .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really {disfmarker} it will be seen in the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer:Need it to be , okay .\nProject Manager:So you will have {disfmarker} Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:so you will have to model model something .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yep\nProject Manager:And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:So ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:no more questions , we can close the session .\nIndustrial Designer:Sounds good , mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay , cool .\nMarketing:Okay .\n", "summary": "This meeting was about conceptual design. The user interface designer first introduced three concepts in the user interface - Google controller, fancy controller, and intelligent controller. The first two were approved by the project manager, but the last one was seriously questioned. The group finally decided to mix the Google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands. The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects —material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with LCD, applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, and using low level chips, which was agreed by the group. The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative. At the same time, being user-friendly was also important. Then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice.", "length": 11676},
{"id": 28, "conversations": "User Interface:Hmm hmm hmm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Are we {disfmarker} we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay , that's fine . Am I supposed to be standing up there ? Okay .\nMarketing:So we've got both of these clipped on ? She gonna answer me or not ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , I've got {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Right , both of them , okay .\nProject Manager:Yes .\nMarketing:God .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Jesus , it's gonna fall off {gap} .\nUser Interface:Okay . Yep , yep . {vocalsound} Okay . Tu tu tu tu\nProject Manager:Okay . {vocalsound} Hello everybody .\nUser Interface:Hi , good morning .\nProject Manager:Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Okay , this is our agenda , um {vocalsound} we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh {disfmarker} people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . Um , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Oops .\nProject Manager:Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . Um {disfmarker} What's missing ? We're running out of blue . Okay . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:And I see them as majestic , and independent , and proud .\nUser Interface:Oh sorry . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Now , who would like to go next ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , me .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{gap} Cat . Where did this come from ?\nProject Manager:Is that your lapel then ?\nUser Interface:Uh , yep .\nProject Manager:There you go .\nUser Interface:Thank you . Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ?\nMarketing:A kind of dog ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yep . It's actually sitting , so {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's sitting down .\nMarketing:Sorry ?\nUser Interface:it's sitting , it's not standing .\nMarketing:Uh .\nUser Interface:Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive . It's your best friend and your {disfmarker} you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . {gap} dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog .\nProject Manager:Okay , thank you .\nUser Interface:Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I'll have a go .\nUser Interface:Okay . Sorry .\nIndustrial Designer:Thanks .\nMarketing:Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Alright , okay .\nMarketing:you can get to the top , with standing on a chair .\nIndustrial Designer:Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Does it look like a dog actually ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah .\nProject Manager:Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:I think it's outstandingly good . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:because that looks like a beak now , so . {vocalsound} Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile .\nMarketing:Crocodile ?\nProject Manager:Gonna be a bird . Is it gonna be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well it was it was an {disfmarker} at first {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} it's gonna be a bird .\nIndustrial Designer:firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican\nMarketing:O\nIndustrial Designer:but it can be a crocodile now actually {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} That's lovely .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . Um\nMarketing:Beauti that's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:uh scary , uh strong , yeah that's about it I think {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:Okay {vocalsound} it's fine .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay . Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills ,\nIndustrial Designer:Uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:mine's {disfmarker} are dreadful . Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in .\nIndustrial Designer:Wo {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I hope that clicks in , I'll just {disfmarker} I'll hold it on , okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oops , oh dear , what happened there ?\nProject Manager:Technical help .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay , uh {disfmarker} Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nMarketing:Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:S Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Uh .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:It's not a vampire bat honestly {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , yeah .\nMarketing:Uh and somewhere there's a body behind .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , some sort of bird {vocalsound}\nMarketing:That's my dreadful {disfmarker} that's the worst yet , that's {disfmarker} it's meant to be an eagle {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:A seagu\nUser Interface:Eagle , okay .\nProject Manager:right ,\nIndustrial Designer:Ah eagle , right okay .\nProject Manager:not a seagull {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:you can tell it's a flying animal {vocalsound} could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . {vocalsound} Da dum um .\nIndustrial Designer:They're good at golf .\nMarketing:Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Eagle .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , no yeah ,\nMarketing:Are they ?\nIndustrial Designer:an eagle .\nMarketing:Oh . Oh right , okay ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'm not good at golf .\nIndustrial Designer:{gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . And uh , birds of prey aren't they ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:oh dear , intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:There we go ,\nProject Manager:That's lovely .\nMarketing:hope that pen's gonna be okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Whoops .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay . That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ?\nIndustrial Designer:It's about {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:One point four or something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:mm , mm yeah .\nMarketing:Seventeen .\nUser Interface:One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah , something like that ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:D fifteen ?\nIndustrial Designer:yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that .\nProject Manager:Seventeen .\nMarketing:Seventeen Pounds .\nProject Manager:Okay , that's expensive .\nMarketing:Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ?\nProject Manager:I think so , I think so ,\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I'll be able to um pull it up ,\nMarketing:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:or I could put it in the shared folder or something .\nIndustrial Designer:Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those {disfmarker} the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So , it'd still be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Really ?\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , we had to buy one {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:So\nProject Manager:Mm . I think {disfmarker}\nMarketing:so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay , pretty huge margin .\nProject Manager:half of the selling price is taken up by building it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:which is uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:In our first year ?\nProject Manager:Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So then {disfmarker}\nMarketing:You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone\nProject Manager:No , yeah .\nMarketing:{disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone . Okay .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Big target group {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point ,\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Alright .\nUser Interface:that c\nProject Manager:but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah uh .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .\nIndustrial Designer:Use all the ones at the same time .\nMarketing:Right .\nUser Interface:Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause you {disfmarker}\nMarketing:My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .\nProject Manager:Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .\nUser Interface:So simplification of symbols you could think of .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um . When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .\nMarketing:Oh yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:it's obvious what you're doing , um .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Menu , alright .\nMarketing:I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:so you've got a little L_C_D_ display .\nUser Interface:Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .\nMarketing:With menus , yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number .\nProject Manager:Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:I don't think they tape things ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I don't think they use {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,\nProject Manager:Mm , yeah , the age gap .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I don't know , I d\nIndustrial Designer:But I don't know how {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Teletext has got that option as well .\nMarketing:Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm , okay . S\nProject Manager:I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Y\nUser Interface:It might\nMarketing:Yeah ?\nUser Interface:it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yes , no that's important .\nUser Interface:But it might have its cost implications .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , like smaller .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:Something that's easily moulded and produced .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um , right , okay\nIndustrial Designer:No uh uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui\nMarketing:Ah right .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic\nMarketing:Sure b y yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:I presume it would .\nProject Manager:I would {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , so let's break it up there . Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:So , see you in half an hour .\nMarketing:Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?\nUser Interface:Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager:I think so , yeah .\n", "summary": "Project Manager introduced a new remote control project. The team started to know each other by drawing favourite animals. Project Manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 Euros, considering the 12.5-Euro production cost. The market range would be international and over all age groups. After the financial targets, the team discussed the remote design. Despite the \"one-for-all\" style, the remote was still supposed to be user-friendly. Standard features such as sorting through channels and adjusting volume would not lose their priority. The team, therefore, agreed on a style of basic buttons with a self-intuitive screen menu. Silver lightweight plastic was temporarily decided to be the material, for it is easily moulded and cost-saving.", "length": 6204},

Okay , that's fine .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Oh God .\nProject Manager:Are we done ? Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?\nMarketing:Uh , no that's okay ,\nProject Manager:Okay , um {vocalsound}\nMarketing:sorry .\nProject Manager:I'll go over what we decided last meeting ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment .\nUser Interface:Sorry .\nProject Manager:Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um {disfmarker} try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of {disfmarker} oh oh you can see it , okay {vocalsound} . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . Okay . Um , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ?\nMarketing:Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information ,\nProject Manager:No that's fine , that's fine . {gap}\nMarketing:is that okay ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Unplug me .\nIndustrial Designer:Thanks . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ?\nProject Manager:Um , F_N_ function F_ eight .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh right , yeah . Okay . Maybe {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah sure .\nMarketing:is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .\nMarketing:Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah the the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:They are .\nIndustrial Designer:well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption\nMarketing:Oh I see .\nIndustrial Designer:and how much you need to send the data across .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the {vocalsound} uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would {disfmarker} the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to {vocalsound} whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and {disfmarker} reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,\nMarketing:Mm . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker} th that was just sort of a general point there .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} And that's uh {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,\nProject Manager:Okay , thank you very much .\nIndustrial Designer:so if you wanna {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um , would you like to continue on from that ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nIndustrial Designer:Ooh .\nUser Interface:'Kay . It can be {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or , maybe move the laptop over .\nUser Interface:okay , that's okay with me . {gap} further . {gap}\nProject Manager:{gap}\nUser Interface:Oops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ?\nProject Manager:F_ function .\nIndustrial Designer:Function F_ eight yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay . Mm why's it in the right ?\nMarketing:No . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .\nUser Interface:Yeah , it's connecting {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer:No , no yeah it's just {gap} .\nMarketing:Meter adjusting .\nUser Interface:{gap} okay .\nProject Manager:Oh , there {gap} .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Uh any comments like , if you want ?\nProject Manager:'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah sure .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . Oh , God . Right , okay .\nUser Interface:I think you'll have to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Have I got to keep this here ?\nUser Interface:You can't {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Does it matter ?\nUser Interface:It'll have to {disfmarker} this can't be pulled .\nMarketing:I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ?\nProject Manager:We just do the best we can .\nMarketing:Uh , whoops .\nUser Interface:You'll have to push it a bit more .\nMarketing:Will it manage ? Bit more ,\nUser Interface:Yep .\nMarketing:oh dear . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah this is more than enough . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Oh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:There we go .\nMarketing:Is that okay ?\nUser Interface:Yeah I think you can pull it out now .\nMarketing:Thank you ,\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:just pull it closer a little bit .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh you should be able to {gap} and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , you might .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , there you go .\nMarketing:Get it right over , okay , thank you .\nProject Manager:Ah . Look at that .\nMarketing:Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . {vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . {vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nMarketing:but I think I'll just keep it simple ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,\nUser Interface:{gap} That's fine .\nProject Manager:Okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:is that okay ?\nProject Manager:Right , um\nIndustrial Designer:Huh .\nProject Manager:we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um {vocalsound} our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it limits the cost for us ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?\nProject Manager:It says for T_V_ only , so {vocalsound} looks like it's just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Just channel-hopping .\nProject Manager:yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but {vocalsound} I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .\nMarketing:Would that imply video use ?\nIndustrial Designer:T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g\nProject Manager:I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . If yeah {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer:and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .\nProject Manager:Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and {vocalsound} programming .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons ,\nUser Interface:Ten perc\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Pens\nIndustrial Designer:and they're not that great anyway .\nMarketing:In fact I've just called up that table there ,\nIndustrial Designer:Alright , okay .\nMarketing:we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer:Alright , okay .\nMarketing:So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but um on on that again I just thought {disfmarker} 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:bu\nMarketing:Oh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:so I thought that could be quite a {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:um because it is something I {disfmarker} it needs to be {disfmarker} the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager:maybe {vocalsound} on the T_V_ {disfmarker} you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yes . That's a super idea .\nProject Manager:but that's {disfmarker} that sounds a lot cheaper to me .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well .\nMarketing:Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may {disfmarker} and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs {gap} ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Sure .\nIndustrial Designer:Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs\nUser Interface:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .\nIndustrial Designer:Just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What about {disfmarker} you were talking about the buttons ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah ? Um so you {disfmarker} it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to {disfmarker} you don't actually have to press them you just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , think that might appeal {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,\nMarketing:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:trendy kind of a thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def\nProject Manager:Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can {gap} oh yeah that's obvious what that's for\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm , mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um {vocalsound} if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big\nProject Manager:Were too big .\nIndustrial Designer:because um {vocalsound} they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} 'cause you {disfmarker} obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .\nUser Interface:Yeah , uh maybe to {disfmarker} as uh {disfmarker} it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .\nProject Manager:I think we have to design one product\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm . Huh .\nProject Manager:and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .\nProject Manager:It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:I'm j I really can't get my head round this one ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .\nIndustrial Designer:I {disfmarker} yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause {disfmarker} without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel\nMarketing:Mm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .\nIndustrial Designer:and it becomes {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or a speech recognition ,\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . Yeah , speech recognition ,\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:which is extremely expensive ,\nIndustrial Designer:but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:Yes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um .\nUser Interface:We could focus on the biggest market .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?\nIndustrial Designer:Ge uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .\nProject Manager:We are {disfmarker} we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume {disfmarker} associate that with the older generations .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people .\nMarketing:Mm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first {disfmarker} it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .\nProject Manager:Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,\nIndustrial Designer:Video plus .\nProject Manager:yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah .\nProject Manager:I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:because you've got your general record anyway so if you {disfmarker} there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in\nIndustrial Designer:Just whack in the number .\nProject Manager:and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that ,\nIndustrial Designer:And you w {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:it's just a number .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,\nProject Manager:No .\nIndustrial Designer:you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,\nProject Manager:You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nMarketing:Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:It is\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:after um {disfmarker} if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards\nIndustrial Designer:It's not {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager:and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth\nMarketing:Ah , hmm .\nProject Manager:so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times ,\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:um and it has been around for quite a long time .\nIndustrial Designer:It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .\nProject Manager:No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Superb . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it {disfmarker} you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .\nMarketing:Excellent , mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:So that {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:But just to have that function would be would be really good .\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:Okay so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , {gap} to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um {disfmarker} the companies who uh who you deal with have actually {disfmarker} they've they've got an obligation to to help you out\nMarketing:Mm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and also {disfmarker} I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?\nMarketing:Alright . {vocalsound} Yes\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel ,\nIndustrial Designer:{gap}\nMarketing:but I mean for {disfmarker} if there were any more {disfmarker} or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video ,\nProject Manager:I think so .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , I mean {disfmarker}\nMarketing:we're not gonna put any {disfmarker} {vocalsound} okay , just a thought .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .\nProject Manager:Instruction manuals . But I mean they're {disfmarker} there's customer service ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Department , yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Sure .\nProject Manager:and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Right .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to {disfmarker} for a phone maybe he might walk down the street ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .\nIndustrial Designer:And they're {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Not for such simple functions\nIndustrial Designer:yeah , they should be f yeah .\nMarketing:because we're focusing on that ,\nProject Manager:Mm . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible\nMarketing:yes okay .\nUser Interface:Simple .\nProject Manager:because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .\nProject Manager:It does ,\nIndustrial Designer:It's the uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about .\nMarketing:Sure , okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um , what other functions ? We need {disfmarker} I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about {disfmarker} c 'cause you've got the dilemma between {disfmarker} oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well they la they they last quite a long time ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and if you had uh {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and if {disfmarker} yeah if you if you had if you had one of those {disfmarker} uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah it could be on that {disfmarker} yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah on that as well so .\nUser Interface:So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?\nProject Manager:S\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nProject Manager:Yes .\nIndustrial Designer:some sort of docking station or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Rechargeable with a docking station .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah .\nProject Manager:So the rechargeable which would be your field .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Yes ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:which it is cheaper in the long run as well .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how much you try and make it simple ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical ,\nProject Manager:They do .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely {disfmarker} an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .\nProject Manager:Okay so we've got a flip-screen .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:and you don't have to {disfmarker} you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .\nMarketing:Slightly curved , curved .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway .\nUser Interface:y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:the way you h hold of {disfmarker} it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .\nProject Manager:Can you look into the company logo ? Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .\nUser Interface:Current .\nProject Manager:I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design ,\nMarketing:{gap}\nProject Manager:while also making it quite different from anything else that's there .\nUser Interface:We could look in at that but {disfmarker} Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells ,\nMarketing:I mean look at the mobile .\nUser Interface:logo could become as {disfmarker} you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .\nProject Manager:Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different .\nMarketing:I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that sounds a really attractive idea ,\nUser Interface:A sea shell ?\nMarketing:I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of {disfmarker} yeah and that opens out into your flip-top .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea\nUser Interface:Yeah we could look in at that .\nMarketing:and plus you can get {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know even though we're using plastic , you can still {disfmarker} I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .\nProject Manager:Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah . Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't {disfmarker} not gonna lose it so much {vocalsound} either . It's easier to {disfmarker} bit nice to handle .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are {disfmarker} whichever appeals the most like ,\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:that could be the most common design .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:But we can like think of five , six designs .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right , I think we have to round it up , um {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .\nProject Manager:Sure .\nMarketing:So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus .\nProject Manager:That was um in cutting down the number {disfmarker} that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you {disfmarker} it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and {disfmarker} Or was {disfmarker} is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just {disfmarker} that was an add-on feature ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .\nMarketing:Uh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ?\nProject Manager:Um it could be it c It {disfmarker} yes ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature ,\nMarketing:Right .\nProject Manager:you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .\nMarketing:Mm , and the rechargeable batteries .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Was there anything else there that we {disfmarker} in the new new project requirements ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {gap}\nProject Manager:We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at ,\nProject Manager:Yes . Yes .\nMarketing:what preference {disfmarker} so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .\nProject Manager:And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .\nUser Interface:For detection , right .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um . I think {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yep ,\nProject Manager:Yep ,\nUser Interface:I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and different from what's out there . Yep , I think that's us .\nMarketing:Okay .\nUser Interface:True .\nMarketing:What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ?\nProject Manager:I think you might get guidance , but um I th Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:u um , they're {disfmarker} everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um .\nUser Interface:Oops .\nMarketing:Whoops , questionnaire four .\nUser Interface:We should f\nProject Manager:Yes , right . Okay .\nUser Interface:I think it's time for us to get back to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think .\nProject Manager:Right , okay . I think you can email me , if there's any more questions . Um and I'll be able to not answer them .\n", "summary": "The team mainly made some adjustments to the remote control design to meet the new project requirements. The second meeting started with Project Manager who briefly went over the last meeting. Industrial Designer hoped to minimize the size of the battery. The team thus decided on a rechargeable one. User Interface desired to simplify the remote control style, cutting down unnecessary functions. According to the market research presented by Marketing, the team agreed on a trendy and user-friendly flip-top design.

{"id": 32, "conversations": "Project Manager:Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Alright we're moving on to conceptual design .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} 'Scuse me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Bless you .\nProject Manager:Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , {vocalsound} under marketing we targeted our audience , and {disfmarker} Um , yeah . That was {vocalsound} generally {vocalsound} {disfmarker} how helpful that was .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're {disfmarker} Right , um {disfmarker} So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what {disfmarker} where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ?\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nUser Interface:Yes .\nProject Manager:Would anybody like to go first ?\nIndustrial Designer:Sure .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .\nProject Manager:And why not wood ?\nIndustrial Designer:And ,\nProject Manager:And why not wood ? {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:hmm ? {vocalsound} Uh , well we can use wood . {vocalsound} I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design .\nProject Manager:'S good .\nMarketing:Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material\nProject Manager:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:which is quite shocking .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the {vocalsound} is the current trend\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to {disfmarker} I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:but that's just a personal opinion .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find {disfmarker} come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Thank you for your attention .\nUser Interface:So .\nProject Manager:I think it's the next {disfmarker} it's the blue one , yeah .\nUser Interface:Oh , uh , there we go . {vocalsound} Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} I actually wasn't aware of the {vocalsound} new trends in electronics\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um {vocalsound} fabrics . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway . Um {vocalsound} here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . {vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?\nProject Manager:Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .\nUser Interface:'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this {disfmarker} it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um {vocalsound} the wheel\nProject Manager:You need a screen for it ?\nUser Interface:you {disfmarker} it seems like you would need a screen .\nIndustrial Designer:You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But like if you think about it {disfmarker} yeah but if {disfmarker} so is it just {disfmarker} okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?\nProject Manager:We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,\nUser Interface:Are we {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:that was one of th I I was {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:sorry ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:I I meant to update you on that . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Alright . Okay .\nMarketing:But the screen can come up on the telly , the {disfmarker} she said .\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:That correct ?\nUser Interface:So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna {disfmarker} I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a {disfmarker} right .\nMarketing:Graphical interface ?\nUser Interface:Yeah like you're g\nMarketing:Uh on the {disfmarker} you can have it on the telly though .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can {disfmarker} okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So that {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} people seems to be {disfmarker} well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:You've {disfmarker} Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um {vocalsound} I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because {disfmarker} So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if {disfmarker} or or {disfmarker} then again if you just {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker} I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:But but imagine someone with s\nIndustrial Designer:My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .\nUser Interface:I oh yeah ?\nProject Manager:But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:'Cause you'll have to like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:They have to r wheel really fast .\nUser Interface:but you can quickly s you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:at least on theirs .\nUser Interface:Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth\nProject Manager:Right .\nUser Interface:And then there's also the concern about you know um {vocalsound} how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um {vocalsound} you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,\nProject Manager:Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I'd think that the screen would be better ,\nUser Interface:like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:because you could have that menu option , sort of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I would think so too , like {disfmarker} So I mean {disfmarker} and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but then again it would {disfmarker} it does make kind of {disfmarker} if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:It's more expensive according to the design people .\nUser Interface:m yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , that's the only thing though .\nIndustrial Designer:You have to get a {disfmarker} an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} You can get to {disfmarker} you know , you can {disfmarker} Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can {disfmarker} it brings up like the menu on the T_V_\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So the T_V_ is the screen , that {disfmarker} yeah\nUser Interface:yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:So it would have all these different options of changing\nUser Interface:Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .\nProject Manager:to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Look it even has settings .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Hmm ?\nMarketing:On the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} you can just take theirs and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:but um {disfmarker} 'cause that just {disfmarker} it does seem like , it {disfmarker} that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but {disfmarker} I dunno , and then {disfmarker} so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um , right . What if {disfmarker} I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ .\nProject Manager:Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah definitely .\nProject Manager:okay .\nUser Interface:Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I mean it it needs to be easy to {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah but should be comfortable .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:I mean how do how do {disfmarker} I'm not really {disfmarker} Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah I use it like that .\nIndustrial Designer:W when we had the wheely remote control , we {disfmarker} it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But , were there buttons on there as well ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do .\nProject Manager:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So we just used the top part .\nUser Interface:Mm yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , so {disfmarker} but I mean I think it could be pretty small .\nMarketing:Uh .\nUser Interface:Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you {disfmarker} so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .\nUser Interface:But can't you just get {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Do {disfmarker} do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:K\nMarketing:Well you can have it on the settings ,\nProject Manager:Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:no ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen .\nProject Manager:Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:is is {disfmarker} if w I {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:That keeps it\nProject Manager:if we can do this , that'd probably be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:really {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh you wouldn't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I just don't think you would even need it .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this {disfmarker} how they actually programme these things , and if that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?\nProject Manager:yeah . I mean it {disfmarker} would y would {disfmarker} that would be {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know .\nUser Interface:I mean you can do it ,\nMarketing:They already do it .\nIndustrial Designer:I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .\nUser Interface:you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm not sure .\nUser Interface:It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Well they usually are .\nUser Interface:which is a little {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:My {disfmarker} I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know .\nMarketing:No .\nProject Manager:Huh .\nUser Interface:But um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:So , um {disfmarker} but I mean it's {disfmarker} I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , it {disfmarker} most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah . Well so {disfmarker} So , do we need {disfmarker} I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about {disfmarker} But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:That's what it does anyway .\nMarketing:But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you {disfmarker} like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and I never get it .\nProject Manager:yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Never ever .\nUser Interface:So , but {disfmarker}\nMarketing:So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?\nMarketing:Well on the telly .\nIndustrial Designer:Or on the T_V_ too .\nUser Interface:On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those {disfmarker} like okay now I hit this {disfmarker} you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .\nProject Manager:Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:so that fits with the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are {vocalsound} really hot right now , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:B Yeah .\nMarketing:Did you did you get that pc picture on {disfmarker} did they provide you with that picture on the web ?\nUser Interface:Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing:That's quite interesting . What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Oh god . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Oh , I was gonna say .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nIndustrial Designer:You said uh people want spongy .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Um , one of your {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's {gap} in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy .\nUser Interface:Oh , okay , that would be cool .\nProject Manager:Ah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of {disfmarker} oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah . I mean definitely the area round it .\nUser Interface:But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:so you're like {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think it could work .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Or what if we integrated the {vocalsound} the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana .\nUser Interface:a vegetable . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Well it could be like mobiles that just {disfmarker} you just put a cover .\nProject Manager:An orange . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing:If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:which frankly I'm not particularly fond of ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:You know you had {disfmarker} there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .\nIndustrial Designer:You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:And it could {disfmarker} the colour can fit your sitting room ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have {disfmarker} well I don't know . Um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So what if {disfmarker} what\nUser Interface:So I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} this is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:yeah , colours .\nProject Manager:I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Is that kind of {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:I {disfmarker} 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:I do I dunno . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just {disfmarker} the feedback we've just got about the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Maybe a ball .\nProject Manager:A ball ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Know , a squashy ball .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} A relaxing squashy ball . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That you can p\nUser Interface:That's in the shape of a fruit , like a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:well I {disfmarker} see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:and I'm thinking how do you change the hard {disfmarker} would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:This is just {disfmarker} Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .\nMarketing:Oh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:That {disfmarker} see I was thinking this s\nMarketing:Which is cheaper .\nProject Manager:sorry {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .\nProject Manager:I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh . Mm .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:And like this {disfmarker} you could have like you could have like cherries and {vocalsound} things around there .\nUser Interface:Oh I like that shape .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I was thinking sort of a single ball shape .\nProject Manager:I was thinking if it was like this {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:So you're holding a squishy ball\nProject Manager:'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and then it has a {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:It's like it has to be s\nProject Manager:It's almost like your thumb is farther up ,\nUser Interface:yeah {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager:so if if you could squish it lower then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I guess so .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either {disfmarker} like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .\nProject Manager:Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah .\nUser Interface:What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can {disfmarker} so so maybe one you know {disfmarker} you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:and you could get {disfmarker} you could have your choice , you know ?\nMarketing:Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:But {disfmarker} well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that ,\nUser Interface:Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:No .\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Hmm . Well that's not very neat , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Um .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . I mean I think uh {disfmarker} and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely {disfmarker} So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .\nMarketing:If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your {disfmarker} to the way you hold it .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah you could squish it .\nMarketing:If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you {disfmarker} it it just moulds to your hand .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .\nUser Interface:Fruits and veg .\nMarketing:We we don't know . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:And the rest is the company {disfmarker} the company colour's silver ?\nProject Manager:It was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:We could promote the banana one .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Like {disfmarker} mm .\nProject Manager:I mean that's another question , where are we gonna {disfmarker} we we should have the logo somewhere on it .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case .\nUser Interface:Oh yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah , th and that would {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But uh it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:No but it does it automatically .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Does it automatically ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:I don't know .\nProject Manager:I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} But if someone {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark .\nIndustrial Designer:That was me .\nProject Manager:Was that you ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yes .\nProject Manager:Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .\nMarketing:Oh , a dynamo is {disfmarker} ah , {vocalsound} it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:So I sort of picked battery .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's quite sweet .\nIndustrial Designer:We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .\nProject Manager:I think batteries sound good .\nIndustrial Designer:It {vocalsound} it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .\nProject Manager:What does everyone else think ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} The dynamo would be interesting {vocalsound} .\nMarketing:No . But dynamo {disfmarker} the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it {vocalsound} creates energy on its own .\nProject Manager:What about Kryptonite ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Oh .\nMarketing:Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:Don't know the cost .\nIndustrial Designer:Didn't have enough data to actually {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?\nIndustrial Designer:All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost .\nMarketing:Okay . Right .\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .\nProject Manager:What does chip on print mean ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .\nProject Manager:Right . So , chip on print is just {disfmarker} means like that they're mass-produced .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about ,\nIndustrial Designer:Case is what we were discussing yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah . Casing . Yeah . {gap} thinking of like syntactic case and thi\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:um {vocalsound} let's see . Is there anything else we need to\nUser Interface:Hmm .\nProject Manager:talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .\nMarketing:Oh , thank you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Cool .\nProject Manager:See you soon . Does it matter that I end early ?\nMarketing:I {disfmarker} it's strange because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:How how early is it ? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said {disfmarker}\n", "summary": "This meeting was mainly about conceptual design. Industrial Designer, Marketing and User Interface gave presentations mainly on component design, current trend and interface design respectively, based on their research on the website incorporating the ideas from last meeting. A lot of discussions was centred around the fruit and vegetable theme, which was the current marketing trend. In the meanwhile, they had some discussions on physical attributes and the use of energy. They agreed that the screen was not necessary, and TV could be used as the screen instead. In addition, Kryptonite became their preferred energy.", "length": 11138},

Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm .\nProject Manager:Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:After lunch . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right um this is our conceptual design meeting ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:um {vocalsound} I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well .\nProject Manager:I th I I think {disfmarker} yeah um .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .\nIndustrial Designer:Etcetera .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a {disfmarker} leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:things like that ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?\nMarketing:Shall I ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Yes if you feel {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Okay . We just connect up .\nProject Manager:{gap}\nMarketing:Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's okay {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nProject Manager:Okay thank you very much . Um\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:let's start from the inside and work our way out .\nUser Interface:Fine . It's okay with me .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay . {gap}\nMarketing:Unless anyone has any questions about that ?\nProject Manager:I don't think so , not yet .\nMarketing:Not yet ? 'Kay .\nProject Manager:Um , yes , thank you .\nIndustrial Designer:That screwed in ? {gap}\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:I hate those little things\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} I know .\nIndustrial Designer:'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .\nProject Manager:'Kay . {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we {disfmarker} I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,\nProject Manager:Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?\nIndustrial Designer:people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .\nProject Manager:Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:So you wind up your remote control before you use it .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:How {vocalsound} {disfmarker} what kind of {disfmarker} how l long can you get out of that ,\nIndustrial Designer:It might {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:You {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get {disfmarker} when when you got T_V_ .\nProject Manager:That doesn't count though does it ?\nMarketing:Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?\nProject Manager:I thought it was U_V_ like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No .\nMarketing:Artificial light ?\nIndustrial Designer:Is it ? Alright i\nProject Manager:Any , any {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Has to be solar .\nUser Interface:Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or {disfmarker} and dynamo might take more space .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .\nProject Manager:I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights\nMarketing:Mm . Artificial light , no .\nProject Manager:no , but I mean not many {disfmarker} you don't want to limit your market .\nMarketing:That's going to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .\nUser Interface:Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I know ,\nIndustrial Designer:But {disfmarker}\nMarketing:different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah\nUser Interface:Right .\nIndustrial Designer:and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .\nUser Interface:Night .\nProject Manager:Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .\nIndustrial Designer:But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches\nProject Manager:Yeah I've seen {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .\nUser Interface:And are these like uh {disfmarker} what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um yeah it's {disfmarker} it charges into um some form of {disfmarker} it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause they use them quite frequently in watches .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out {gap} .\nUser Interface:We c\nProject Manager:But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah but then again\nProject Manager:Is it really gonna be enough ?\nIndustrial Designer:I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um {vocalsound} it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it\nProject Manager:So it's not {disfmarker} the draw on it isn't {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and you put it {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Could I just ask {disfmarker} referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging\nIndustrial Designer:Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing\nMarketing:or the two things not compatible ?\nProject Manager:Like a dual kind of .\nIndustrial Designer:but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .\nMarketing:Mm . So that affects the exterior design .\nUser Interface:Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .\nProject Manager:Expensive as well . What kind of price are we looking at for {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:It's twelve point f\nProject Manager:I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the {disfmarker} It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,\nProject Manager:Solar .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y\nProject Manager:Well they're not designed {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .\nProject Manager:Practical-wise okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,\nProject Manager:You do get a bit of wear\nIndustrial Designer:they can t\nProject Manager:but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Another question is like {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Again it de\nUser Interface:sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nUser Interface:A remote control , like ,\nIndustrial Designer:W m yeah\nUser Interface:so we have to s look at the life also .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:so the {disfmarker} Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in {disfmarker} or triple A_s would last .\nMarketing:It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah .\nMarketing:i {vocalsound} it's not gonna add anything , okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well add it in to think about um\nMarketing:right , okay .\nProject Manager:because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:the eternal battle for control of the controls .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:it's not a thing that people are looking for\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:when we threw it open to the field yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .\nProject Manager:Okay , right .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay , well I'll move on .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .\nProject Manager:What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units\nUser Interface:Second thing is {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Hinged , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:for the flip phone .\nUser Interface:yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I th\nUser Interface:or it's like only specific to plastic or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .\nMarketing:It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing:I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,\nIndustrial Designer:Rubber , yeah .\nMarketing:that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .\nIndustrial Designer:And you can peel them off yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,\nMarketing:Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .\nUser Interface:Something like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:That could be a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:It could {disfmarker} it would be comfortable to hold on also .\nProject Manager:Okay . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:T\nMarketing:Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .\nMarketing:Mm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Also the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the {disfmarker} I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch\nUser Interface:Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:display . Uh what what {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could {disfmarker} becau you could fit it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve {disfmarker} curved things with it ,\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but um you can {disfmarker} you wouldn't have {disfmarker} with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:With {disfmarker} W also with the {disfmarker}\nMarketing:I don't {disfmarker} s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Oh it would be flat inside .\nIndustrial Designer:You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,\nMarketing:yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .\nMarketing:Have I misunderstood you ?\nIndustrial Designer:It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:but there'd be touch touch buttons ,\nUser Interface:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .\nProject Manager:I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Is rubber . Mm .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .\nProject Manager:Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out\nProject Manager:Like one of the palm pop thing .\nIndustrial Designer:but I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:Absolutely , f for somebody who {gap} very often , if he would {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:'cause I had {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:It would have to be attached .\nMarketing:They're easy to replace as well , cheap .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a {gap}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface:and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah okay .\nMarketing:Yeah just a thought {disfmarker} they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Okay , we'll talk about that {disfmarker} so if you finish your {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and we'll come back to that .\nIndustrial Designer:yeah that {disfmarker} that's the end of m my {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:That's you , right okay .\nUser Interface:And just one small question before like you are {gap} , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .\nIndustrial Designer:Uh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate {disfmarker} you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them ,\nUser Interface:Okay . Okay .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .\nMarketing:I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?\nProject Manager:No .\nMarketing:And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display {disfmarker} th uh the remote control display thing .\nProject Manager:We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .\nIndustrial Designer:Um .\nMarketing:They don't look at themselves ? Just a thought .\nProject Manager:Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah , no , no .\nMarketing:{gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , okay .\nMarketing:that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nUser Interface:Like , some some people have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Here you see this ? This is on a {disfmarker} I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:and g graphic user interface\nMarketing:Sorry what does that stand for ?\nProject Manager:Which means {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,\nMarketing:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:which is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:If you if {disfmarker} yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .\nUser Interface:Like you have on a l uh {disfmarker} icons or something y you have {disfmarker} is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So basically {gap} not point or click {gap} {disfmarker} Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .\nProject Manager:Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?\nUser Interface:{gap}\nProject Manager:'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:No you'd hold it {disfmarker} you don't {disfmarker} if you flip it open then you'd be {disfmarker} Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah .\nProject Manager:Yeah . That's what I was just saying ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:and then be able to touch that for the {vocalsound} other controls ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Okay and you mean to the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that ,\nUser Interface:And the lower distance .\nProject Manager:on the lower side .\nUser Interface:Oh f perfect .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:Hmm .\nUser Interface:So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the {disfmarker} for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it {disfmarker} this at a low cost , but for {disfmarker} like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh {disfmarker} you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . My personal preferences would be like , as already {gap} uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh\nMarketing:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh\nIndustrial Designer:Well , yeah we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .\nProject Manager:I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ?\nUser Interface:This is central one , the one you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Or is that volume and channel ?\nUser Interface:yeah volume and channel . So keep that m {disfmarker} that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . This and voice recognition .\nProject Manager:Okay . Right . Okay . Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . So , we agree on {disfmarker} Do we agree on the battery ?\nUser Interface:The kinetic .\nMarketing:Kinetic ?\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nProject Manager:so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a\nIndustrial Designer:I mean if {disfmarker} Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have\nProject Manager:selling point .\nIndustrial Designer:and also if they've got it {disfmarker} if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them ,\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun .\nProject Manager:I think the only\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:but I think pretty much we've used cheap {disfmarker} relatively cheap and simple things .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:The L_C_D_'s not cheap .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one ,\nMarketing:Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer:I mean they use them in calculators so .\nProject Manager:Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface:Maybe we could start with the black and white .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:That that way we could upgrade later {gap} .\nProject Manager:And you could {disfmarker} yeah . Okay .\nMarketing:Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Mm .\nMarketing:we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?\nUser Interface:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:Well you cou um .\nProject Manager:Do you want like a back-up ?\nMarketing:No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?\nIndustrial Designer:K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch {disfmarker} a battery that goes in a watch .\nMarketing:I oh I see . Right , okay , got you .\nIndustrial Designer:So it's a lot smaller , so it would {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Got you on that okay , didn't realise .\nProject Manager:Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:So there's not a {disfmarker} really a decision to be made there , um . The buttons {disfmarker} what did you give us as our {disfmarker} The bare-board L_C_D_ or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah the {disfmarker} well I think were {disfmarker} we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons ,\nUser Interface:{gap}\nIndustrial Designer:on the on the on on the top one we're gonna\nProject Manager:On the top one okay you've got the touch\nIndustrial Designer:{disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager:okay and then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Okay , okay .\nMarketing:Sorry could you repeat that last part ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um , okay on {disfmarker} we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .\nMarketing:L_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface:And for the {disfmarker} sorry .\nProject Manager:No , it's fine .\nUser Interface:For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah\nIndustrial Designer:Plastic ,\nUser Interface:we could use the body ,\nProject Manager:For the inside .\nIndustrial Designer:okay .\nUser Interface:for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm ,\nUser Interface:{gap}\nMarketing:so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,\nUser Interface:Plast right .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Oh I think so , I think so .\nMarketing:okay . and it is just uh {disfmarker} although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm no .\nProject Manager:No I think I {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing:just go for the colours .\nUser Interface:It's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:um the fact {disfmarker} the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know {disfmarker}\nMarketing:The feel .\nProject Manager:yes . So we could just pick anything .\nMarketing:'Kay . Mm-hmm . Is that going to be {disfmarker} this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,\nUser Interface:Uh I {disfmarker} it's different .\nProject Manager:It's just different\nMarketing:is that fancy {gap} ?\nProject Manager:it's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses ,\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:sort of beige and black\nMarketing:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:um so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway ,\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:or you want something that contrasts as {vocalsound} you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm .\nMarketing:Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah . I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things .\nProject Manager:Mm .\nMarketing:This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:And you would just have an {disfmarker} across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little {disfmarker}\nMarketing:Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming {disfmarker} I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes {vocalsound}\nMarketing:which is another beauty of it .\nProject Manager:y you know , you could just go so far with it ,\nIndustrial Designer:You can you can just {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever ,\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:so I think that's quite a flexible thing .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case {disfmarker} casing {disfmarker} the case outside ,\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:it should be moulded {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} the design in such a way you can change it every time .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca\nProject Manager:Mm .\nIndustrial Designer:not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .\nUser Interface:Okay . The rubber .\nProject Manager:Yeah . Okay we've got five minutes , {vocalsound} um , or that might've been up for a while .\nUser Interface:Fine .\nMarketing:Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?\nUser Interface:Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also\nMarketing:Mm .\nUser Interface:because that {disfmarker} we are not {gap} for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:So , are we looking at voice {gap} ?\nMarketing:Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,\nUser Interface:Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .\nMarketing:is that right ?\nUser Interface:For l yeah , the whistle .\nIndustrial Designer:Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah .\nUser Interface:So we can {disfmarker} if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .\nMarketing:And incorporating the company logo ?\nUser Interface:Yep .\nProject Manager:Have you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design .\nMarketing:Mm .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nMarketing:'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product\nProject Manager:Well they do ,\nMarketing:don't they ?\nProject Manager:but I think we can {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours .\nProject Manager:well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:and that does the work for you .\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that\nMarketing:Okay .\nProject Manager:so I'm not worried about that .\nMarketing:Okay . Did we {disfmarker} I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?\nProject Manager:Depending on how i {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah , depending on the expense of it .\nProject Manager:I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so\nIndustrial Designer:And they've got in stock , so yeah .\nProject Manager:um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards .\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Right I'm going to wrap it up there .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Fine .\nProject Manager:I got a end meeting now message on my mo\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:yeah\nIndustrial Designer:Did it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} so . Um\nUser Interface:Again a questionnaire huh ?\nProject Manager:so I think we've probably got {disfmarker} it says , closing we have forty minutes\nMarketing:You got to go through .\nProject Manager:so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took {gap} .\nUser Interface:I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Is everyone happy ? {vocalsound} Okay .\n", "summary": "After a brief summary of the last meeting, the team discussed the conceptual design for new remote control, which covered the properties, materials, user interface and trend watching.

Marketing Expert .\nProject Manager:Oh yeah .\nUser Interface:Right .\nProject Manager:Are you ready ? You should put the laptop uh right into the square .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:For i for the cameras , yes .\nUser Interface:For the cameras Alright .\nProject Manager:Good morning , Sebastian .\nIndustrial Designer:Good morning , {vocalsound} Mister P_M_ .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{gap} {disfmarker} I'm fine .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Geez .\nProject Manager:So {disfmarker} Do you want to open it as read-only .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um I guess I should close it here .\nUser Interface:You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um\nMarketing:{gap}\nUser Interface:sen oh stand-by . Close the the window .\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud .\nUser Interface:So {disfmarker} That's right . Ruud .\nProject Manager:Um project kick-off .\nIndustrial Designer:Is there a schedule for this meeting ?\nProject Manager:Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . Good morning , Ruud .\nMarketing:Good morning . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} Uh it's important um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I shall close the door .\nProject Manager:yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Okay . Okay . Um we're here to develop uh a new product .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ?\nIndustrial Designer:That's correct .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .\nUser Interface:Alright .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?\nProject Manager:There is ? Yeah , there is .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} No problem .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . {vocalsound} Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:The market , we should have a look at the market . Um {vocalsound} we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the {gap} {disfmarker} the the progressions , yes .\nUser Interface:Progressions . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific {disfmarker} uh specification of that . Um {vocalsound} the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .\nUser Interface:It's for the vision . Yeah .\nProject Manager:Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it {disfmarker} keep it with the functional design . {vocalsound} Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . {vocalsound} Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um {vocalsound} to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . {vocalsound} Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh\nUser Interface:Sensors .\nProject Manager:sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um well , it {disfmarker} it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um {vocalsound} you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . {vocalsound} Um you can use the eraser to make something go away .\nUser Interface:But we all use the same white-board file\nProject Manager:Yes .\nUser Interface:So we can work together on it while we're {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?\nProject Manager:Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager:It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard .\nUser Interface:Yeah , alright . Yep .\nProject Manager:Um you can choose the format , um {disfmarker} sorry . Uh {disfmarker} Let me see . Um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um {vocalsound} to um {disfmarker} oh well , I'm {disfmarker} I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training {vocalsound} um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:Okay . Um green .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:An animal . Okay . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:Uh a wee rabbit .\nUser Interface:It's a bunny . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:A rabbit . Okay , well great .\nIndustrial Designer:Alright .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .\nUser Interface:But of course , Flores .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Blank .\nProject Manager:Sebastian is thinking about the animal .\nIndustrial Designer:I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Yeah , I'm think about it too . {vocalsound} Format {gap} . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but {vocalsound} it works ,\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , I'll give it a try . {vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager:It it should be a cat .\nUser Interface:right ?\nProject Manager:Okay ?\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} I'm guessing a horse .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:Very good . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:With a very small {vocalsound} legs . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} I was very good in drawing . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:You should feed that uh that animal . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Well , I guess you uh get the idea . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Yes , okay . {vocalsound} Beautiful .\nIndustrial Designer:Beautiful .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions {disfmarker} well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um {vocalsound} the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . {vocalsound} Um\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , {vocalsound} um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh\nProject Manager:Limitations .\nIndustrial Designer:influations influences .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , great .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . {vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .\nUser Interface:And for a cell phone ?\nIndustrial Designer:Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .\nUser Interface:Yeah , okay . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so\nIndustrial Designer:But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all .\nUser Interface:y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's the point .\nUser Interface:Or you shou sh use a {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:So {disfmarker}\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .\nIndustrial Designer:Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:but take these things into account when you start the discussion .\nProject Manager:Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,\nIndustrial Designer:Yes ,\nProject Manager:and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,\nProject Manager:Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:and the way of communicating with these equipments .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay , good .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:That's it .\nProject Manager:Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .\nUser Interface:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?\nUser Interface:Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?\nProject Manager:Yep .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , I think it should be something like that .\nUser Interface:It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,\nProject Manager:Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,\nUser Interface:right ?\nProject Manager:not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it .\nIndustrial Designer:We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?\nProject Manager:No . No .\nIndustrial Designer:No ,\nUser Interface:No , okay .\nIndustrial Designer:we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?\nMarketing:Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:It just should change the T_V_'s state .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?\nUser Interface:Yeah . Yeah , with buttons .\nIndustrial Designer:Or are there any o other controls ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Are there only {disfmarker} any other cont Well , {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nProject Manager:Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer:You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:They're very vu vulnerable .\nIndustrial Designer:w yes ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea ,\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:I don't know .\nUser Interface:And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Maybe not even pointed . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .\nProject Manager:Okay\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:{disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Uh is that uh {disfmarker} are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .\nUser Interface:Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager:Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nUser Interface:But {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Two more things .\nProject Manager:okay .\nUser Interface:Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .\nProject Manager:Okay , s yeah .\nUser Interface:You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nUser Interface:And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nUser Interface:So when it's dark {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Those are two really uh user interface {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha {vocalsound}\nUser Interface:Yeah . {gap} {disfmarker} That's perfect . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .\nIndustrial Designer:Do do you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?\nMarketing:Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .\nProject Manager:Because ?\nMarketing:Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing .\nProject Manager:Mm-hmm .\nMarketing:But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So {disfmarker} we'll probably have to implement that .\nProject Manager:Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?\nIndustrial Designer:Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer:but I've seem to forget them {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forgot them . Um {disfmarker} oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it .\nUser Interface:Yeah . Well , maybe I um {disfmarker} but it it can be quite simple ,\nIndustrial Designer:I I don't know .\nUser Interface:you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nUser Interface:The uh the the digits in black .\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface:Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound}\nUser Interface:{disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .\nProject Manager:Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer:Well , that's more {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:twelve Euro fifty , yeah .\nMarketing:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .\nProject Manager:Okay .\nIndustrial Designer:The cost price is very low .\nUser Interface:Just remind something .\nIndustrial Designer:Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .\nProject Manager:Okay , okay .\nUser Interface:You have a m uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Okay . Very good point . Yeah .\nUser Interface:Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily\nIndustrial Designer:Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager:um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .\nUser Interface:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:But um {disfmarker} Necessary , yeah .\nProject Manager:yeah . I dunno , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's more Sebastian's uh um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface:Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .\nIndustrial Designer:Hmm .\nUser Interface:'Cause I think Bluetooth uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:Well does it ?\nUser Interface:Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .\nIndustrial Designer:well {disfmarker}\nProject Manager:I'm not sure . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay .\nProject Manager:Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer:So uh technically it will be possible .\nUser Interface:But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .\nProject Manager:Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .\nUser Interface:Does it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer:No , you cannot .\nUser Interface:{vocalsound} It's over ?\nIndustrial Designer:{vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing:{vocalsound}\nProject Manager:Um\nIndustrial Designer:Okay .\nProject Manager:{vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it .\nUser Interface:Okay .\nProject Manager:See you in thirty minutes .\nUser Interface:Great .\n", "summary": "This is the kick-off meeting of the new television remote control project. The team got acquainted with each other and Project Manager described the scope of the project. Industrial Designer claimed that he could support any practical ideas technically and proposed that they could make an interoperable remote control. User Interface agreed and pointed out that people changed the state of the TV by pressing the button. Then he proposed that people should be able to feel the buttons without having to look at them and the buttons should be visible in dark. In terms of the way to connect the remote control to the TV, Industrial Designer suggested that infrared could be substituted by Bluetooth.", "length": 7221}]

{"id": 1, "target": "This is the fourth meeting of the design group. The group firstly introduced a prototype which contained the characteristics determined at the last meeting. Then Project Manager pointed out that since the production costs were over budget, they should reduce costs by leaving out solar cells, not using voice recognition and changing the button material into plastics. Then the group went through the evaluation criteria of the product. They thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. When evaluating the project, the group considered that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. Eventually, the group decided to redesign the product.", "prediction": "1. The article discusses the redesign of a product, with the project manager expressing hesitation about the time and resources required. The industrial designer suggests evaluating the product to determine if the objectives are good and to learn from the process.2.

{"id": 3, "target": "The meeting covered the issues with different kinds of mics, progress on the Aurora project, effectiveness of spectral subtraction, adding parameter to spectral coefficient, and studying energy in the data, along with a short discussion on student housing. The team thought that the LDA was doing well for the Aurora project, where the team had made good progress. The linear normalization was not as good. For spectral subtraction, the team discussed recreating data with FFT of combining the Weiner filtering with the signal subspace. The team had not made much progress on using spectral coefficients for voice-unvoice. The current approach was to study the variance, so other ideas were suggested. The meeting ended with a short discussion on student housing and a graduate student's interest in studying energy.", "prediction": "The article discusses the use of wireless microphones in a recording studio, specifically the switch from lapel microphones to wireless headset microphones. The feature \"run command\" in P-make and Customs allows users to execute commands on the fastest available machine in a cluster, and can be used to manage jobs and avoid overwhelming the network."}

Speaker fe008 presented the current status on transcriptions, and explained procedures for cleaning up transcripts and ensuring they conform with set conventions. Speaker mn014 briefly described his efforts to normalize loudness levels across speech channels to distinguish between foreground and background speech. Finally, the group discussed legal and procedural issues concerning the provision of transcripts to meeting participants for 'bleeping out' any sections of speech they want excluded from the Meeting Recorder database.", "prediction": "Transcribing and analyzing spoken language can be challenging due to colloquial forms that are not found in standard dictionaries or lexicons. Researchers suggest using a combination of manual and automated methods to identify and locate these colloquial forms in order to build more accurate and comprehensive language resources."}
{"id": 5, "target": "The group members mainly talked about the details of the belief-net framework. They first discussed the way to make the definition of user and situation clear and set up the standards, e.g., user thrift, based on user's budget. Then they turned to the discussion about endpoint decision. They mentioned approaches including setting features/modes of like selling, fixing and exhibiting, and this inspired the group members to design user compatibility nodes of which value would depend on the user status and situation. They further discussed Go-there decision, which is related to the previous idea using the similar set of the ontologies. Finally, they shifted the topic to different probability computation methods for belief-nets and thought of solutions to issues with limited data annotation.", "prediction": "The article discusses the use of belief propagation in machine learning, particularly in the context of decision-making under uncertainty. Belief propagation is a method for updating beliefs about the state of the world based on new information but can be computationally expensive and may not always converge to the correct solution."}
{"id": 6, "target": "This was a functional design meeting. Based on the presentations of the user interface designer, the industrial designer and the marketing expert, the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful, easy to use, fashionable, recognizable, only for television and Internet-connected. After discussing the industrial design of the product, the group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller with less buttons but whether the product would be wireless was still unsolved. As for the product appearance, the group decided to make the product look fancy and recognizable; nevertheless, they had different opinions on the colour of the product.", "prediction": "The article discusses the potential benefits of using psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, in treating mental health disorders.

In the time remaining, the members did some tool training by drawing their favourite animals on the whiteboard.", "prediction": "Project Manager: So we can start?Marketing: Yeah, suppose I have to do my presentation."}
{"id": 9, "target": "The group discussed the first version of the Bayes-net used to work out a user's intentions when asking for directions from a navigation device. Three intentions were identified: Vista (to view), Enter (to visit) and Tango (to approach). The structure of the belief-net comprises, firstly, a feature layer, which includes linguistic, discourse and world knowledge information that can be gleaned from the data. It is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters( eg \"entrance\", \"type of object\", \"verb\"), each one with a separate middle layer.  At this stage, all the actual probabilities are ad-hoc and hand-coded. However, there has been progress in the design and organisation of experiments, that will eventually provide data more useful and appropriate for this task.", "prediction": "The article discusses the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze data from a user's interactions with a computer interface in order to infer their goals and intentions. The authors propose a new approach that uses a middle layer of hidden variables to represent the user's mental state, which can be used to improve the accuracy of goal inference."}
{"id": 10, "target": "Project Manager invites teammates to brainstorm animal characteristics on remote control function and suggest a reflection on user experience to improve technical function design.

{"id": 11, "target": "The participants discussed results from the experiments that had been conducted. Switching between tasks in the same language had smaller errors than multilingual models. The professor thought that increasing the parameters of the net for larger multi-lingual models would be helpful. The team decided that they should experiment further with different linguistic features. They also discussed how they could speed up their work by relying on greater computational resources.", "prediction": "The study found that adding English to the mix of languages spoken in a household did not improve the cognitive abilities of children aged 3-5, and may have had a negative impact on their language skills for those who were already proficient in their native language. The findings suggest that exposure to multiple languages in early childhood may not necessarily lead to improved cognitive abilities, and that other factors such as quality of language input and social interaction may be more important for language development."}
{"id": 12, "target": "This is the third meeting of the design group. At first, Marketing revealed that ease of use, innovation and a fancy look and feel could be important to customers and the team discussed what colour and material they should use.

{"id": 15, "target": "The meeting began with the Project Manager announcing the task and the agenda. The group should design an original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control through the following meetings. First of all, they did a brief equipment testing on their laptops, the pens, and the whiteboard to ensure they would work. Then getting to the main point of this meeting, the group talked about the budget and reached the agreement that it had to be a universal remote control with such a high price. The group also discussed the functions, the shape and other external design of the remote design, as well as drawing them down as a conceptual draft.", "prediction": "The team is working on a remote control design project, but technical issues are hindering their progress. The team members are using a whiteboard to brainstorm ideas, but the technical issues are slowing down the process."}
{"id": 16, "target": "In this meeting, the speakers addressed issues that related to their meeting annotation progress. They talked about the types and variability of the future meetings. This led to them speaking about how to use their recording equipment if they got groups outside of their own departments to record meetings. Additionally, they discussed how to handle the storage of meetings on disk. They eventually address how to handle speech overlap and speaker anonymity, which were two crucial issues.", "prediction": " Meeting recordings can be challenging to capture using tabletop microphones, especially when there are only a few participants. Researchers are exploring the use of machine learning algorithms to automatically summarize meeting content, but acknowledge the limitations of the corpus and the difficulty of accurately transcribing spoken language."}

{"id": 19, "target": "The team mainly planned the remote control project down to the last detail in the final meeting. Industrial Designer presented the prototype as a clam-shell design with a flip-top LCD touch screen and fully closed flat buttons at the bottom. There would be a wide choice of colours and patterns due to customization. Inside the remote control, there would be a standard chip and a kinetic battery. The team was under the budget at present. Once the budget increased, however, the voice recognition would be incorporated. The remote control's fashion style and location function were most highly rated among the team members, but the minimization of repetitive strain injury was not satisfying enough. All members gave their sincere feedback on teamwork and leadership.", "prediction": " Please provide the ratings for each criterion."}
{"id": 20, "target": "The meeting was mainly about the reasons behind and the measurements against the increasing exclusions from school. The increase brought more pressure to EOTAS in the aspects of finance, transition, curriculum arrangement and the recruitment of professional staff. Although much time and finance had been devoted to the PRU, the education quality could still not be assured. The collaboration between the PRU and the schools required to be strengthened. Besides, training for special education ought to be included in teachers' colleges to meet EOTAS learners' special needs. Their psychological health was another concerning problem.", "prediction": "Schools in Wales are experiencing an increase in exclusions, with some local authorities seeing a 50% rise in the past year. Local authority representatives emphasized the need for a multi-agency approach to address the root causes of exclusions and support vulnerable learners."}
{"id": 21, "target": "This is the second meeting of the design group. Project Manager introduced new project requirements at first. The management required a remote control only for television and aimed at customers under 40. In terms of user interface design, User Interface focused on user-friendliness but still thought multi-function should be considered. Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to substitute voice recognition for the ten digits.

The group decided to write a final report in the end.", "prediction": " Please provide a clear and concise summary of the article."}
{"id": 23, "target": "The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy. Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: \"walk/run into\", \"on the bus\", \"out of film\", \"where is X?\". However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.", "prediction": "The article discusses the use of probabilistic relational models in natural language processing, specifically in the context of tourism. The author proposes a framework for constructing such models, which incorporates elements from ontology, situation, user, and discourse models."}
{"id": 24, "target": "This meeting was about conceptual design. The user interface designer first introduced three concepts in the user interface - Google controller, fancy controller, and intelligent controller. The first two were approved by the project manager, but the last one was seriously questioned. The group finally decided to mix the Google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands. The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects \u2014material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with LCD, applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, and using low level chips, which was agreed by the group.

The article suggests using soft, bright colors and curved shapes to create a playful atmosphere in a children's room."}
{"id": 26, "target": "The whole meeting was a special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. After some regulations proposed by The Chair, the members presented many petitions on behalf of different areas. Then the meeting proceeded to questioning ministers, the attendees asked for the reasons that the government put easy policy for fraudulence and tax evasion of businessmen. Moreover, the participants required government support under the COVID-19 Pandemic, not only for the elderly and vulnerable people, but also for energy resources and tourism sectors. At the same time, the exact funding from the government should be given to green economies including agriculture and forestry. In addition, the meeting also discussed the current situations of different sectors such as employment, fishing and tourism, oil and gas and business affected by the Covid-19 and called for government support for these sectors. Last but not least, the attendees required strict implementations of the laws and appealed for process following. They wanted a transparency and open environment for voting and debating under the precondition of community safety. Also, they wanted affordable medication including vaccines as a part of a sound health care system for their people.", "prediction": "The Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, has been criticized for not doing enough to address tax evasion and avoidance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, he has announced measures to tighten the screws on big businesses that benefit from tax havens and provide direct payments to those who need it."}
{"id": 27, "target": "This was a meeting on the detailed design. First, the user interface designer presented a prototype to show the basic colour and shape of the product. Next, the marketing suggested doing some product evaluation instead of just talking about it, so the group started to judge the design in three aspects: how fancy, technologically innovative, and easy-to-use the remote control was. It got three, two, and four in separate aspects, which meant the design was acceptable. Later, the group discussed the quotation and made some decisions on details of industrial design to make sure the cost was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods. Finally, the group named the product as pineapple remote control.", "prediction": "The team of designers and project managers worked together to create a new remote control for TVs and other devices, with a focus on user-friendly features such as a stable triangle base and a mushroom-shaped button layout.

{"id": 31, "target": "The team was coming close to finalizing the model for Aurora. They were still trying to make some improvements to improve their score. The team began with a discussion about how reverberation could be better accounted for. The professor thought that experimenting with different filters could help achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio. The new system for estimating silence probabilities that the team had added to the model was very effective, but it created a 220ms latency in the VAD. The team was not sure what kinds of constraints would be placed on latency eventually. They wanted to play it safe. The models, over all, were performing well, though the team intended to keep improving them. The team was also trying to figure out how to deal with different kinds of background noise. The meeting ended with a discussion of logistical issues.", "prediction": "The article discusses the use of reverberation in speech processing, specifically in the context of the Aurora project.

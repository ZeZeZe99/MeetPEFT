Others argued that fireworks pose health risks and should be banned. The council heard from the executive who reviewed the proposed ordinance and determined it did not have significant impacts. However, some council members wanted to take more time to discuss the issue before making a final decision.The key points of the ordinance are:- Consumer fireworks would be banned in unincorporated areas of King County, including the International District.- Permits would be required for public displays of fireworks, and the code would specify requirements for applications and traffic control.- The county would not allow the sale of fireworks to people living in unincorporated areas, though wholesale sales would still be allowed.- The fines for violations would increase from $250 to $1,000 per day.Overall, the discussion centered around balancing public safety concerns with cultural and economic interests, while trying to find a middle ground that would pass muster with the public."}

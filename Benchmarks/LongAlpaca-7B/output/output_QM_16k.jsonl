{"target": "This meeting was the eleventh evidence session on the Children Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Publishment Wales Bill. Barry Hughes was there to answer questions related to the Bill. Six main topics that had been discussed or explained. The first one was how the Bill protected the children in terms of prosecutions. The second part explained the divergence between regions and the Bill's implication on England. The third part explained how the law was implemented, and the fourth talked about prosecutions and potential alternatives. Barry Hughes then further explained our-of-court disposals and responded to a specific infrastructure for these cases. In the last part, the meeting turned to discuss a number of unintended consequences related to the Bill.", "prediction": "Here is a summary of the meeting transcript in two sentences:The meeting discussed the proposed Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) Bill which aims to remove the reasonable punishment defence for assaults against children. Barry Hughes, the chief crown prosecutor for Wales, explained the current law and how the proposed bill would change it. He said prosecutions for this offense are unlikely to be double the current low numbers but more likely to increase slightly. However, he acknowledged that the numbers will be small and he cannot see any significant impact on the Crown Prosecution Service's performance targets. The bill is unlikely to conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights, though it may be tested through case law. The low numbers of prosecutions indicate the bill is unlikely to have a major impact on the criminal justice system.", "id": 0}
{"target": "This is the fourth meeting of the design group. The group firstly introduced a prototype which contained the characteristics determined at the last meeting. Then Project Manager pointed out that since the production costs were over budget, they should reduce costs by leaving out solar cells, not using voice recognition and changing the button material into plastics. Then the group went through the evaluation criteria of the product. They thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. When evaluating the project, the group considered that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. Eventually, the group decided to redesign the product.", "prediction": "Here is a summary of the meeting transcript in two sentences:The meeting between Industrial Designer and Project Manager discussed the new remote control prototype.

{"target": "The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy. Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: \"walk/run into\", \"on the bus\", \"out of film\", \"where is X?\". However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.", "prediction": "Here is a summary of the meeting transcript in two sentences:The meeting discusses various topics related to the construction and simulation of language. Professor E and Grad A propose a framework for combining construal mechanisms with general construal rules to analyze language. They discuss examples from the literature and propose future activities. However, Professor E thinks the framework is not context-free and depends on basic cases. Grad C argues that construal is important but not central to the analysis. Professor E thinks the punch line is that the constructions can interact with metaphors and metonymies to provide orthogonality. However, Grad F thinks the framework is too complicated and recommends simplifying the construal mechanisms. Professor E thinks the current thesis proposal is not straightforward enough.", "id": 23}
{"target": "This meeting was about conceptual design. The user interface designer first introduced three concepts in the user interface - Google controller, fancy controller, and intelligent controller.

The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects \u2014material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with LCD, applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, and using low level chips, which was agreed by the group. The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative. At the same time, being user-friendly was also important. Then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice.", "prediction": "The meeting transcript details discussions on designing a new remote control for televisions.

{"id": 13, "target": "The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy. Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: \"walk/run into\", \"on the bus\", \"out of film\", \"where is X?\". However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.", "prediction": "The conversation is between a group of graduate students and their professor. They discuss various topics, including a frustrating meeting, the thesis proposal, and examples of construal in the tourist domain.

The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects \u2014material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with LCD, applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, and using low level chips, which was agreed by the group. The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative. At the same time, being user-friendly was also important. Then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice.", "prediction": "The project manager starts the meeting and assigns roles.

        "source": "Speaker 5: Thank you. I to make clear.\nSpeaker 6: I made this communication for the office. Councilwoman Jeri ships key with recommendation to buy motion of the city council directed the city manager to suspend the contract of North American Limited until the next City Council and Mayor Assume office in July 2014 as membership.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I bring this issue forward because in talking with numerous residents all throughout the city of Long Beach, many question the the wisdom of pushing through any kind of project that is going to financially obligate the next city council.\nSpeaker 9: If this council recalls, we had to deal with the pension spiking that was left to the city council. And this is not something I think a new council, particularly this the first time in the history of Long Beach, you're going to have five new members of the council, possibly six to be handed something that was generated from\nSpeaker 9: this council. So I understand from the city attorney, Mr. Anthony, that, in fact, that the city could direct the city manager to suspend the contract until the new city council comes in so that they can take it up from.\nSpeaker 0: Their council memberships. That's correct.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. And the other reason I bring this up is because as we talk to talk to residents out there, they're they're asking about the city expending $1,000,000 at a time that police officers and I've shared this with the chief and others are telling my constituents and others that we don't have enough officers on the street, that when\nSpeaker 9: we had a fire the other day, that we didn't have an engine directly available across the street and that we don't have engines in two other stations as well. And so I think it's very difficult to explain to them that the city would expand $1,000,000.\nSpeaker 9: I did read the new management memo, which I find very interesting, because I actually kept I keep everything. I kept the 26 and the 27 report to us. And I I would ask, though, that there was a request from city management at that time that two things be done based upon the seismic concerns.\nSpeaker 9: And one of them was to evaluate, evaluate emergency response plans for occupants of this building to ensure personal safety. I know we've had some kind of discussion, but I've never seen in writing what it is that we plan on do.\nSpeaker 9: Because if we do in fact believe this is an unsafe building, that should be the first thing we do. And the second thing was to develop mitigation strategies to address the problems with the wings and the second floor truss.\nSpeaker 9: And so before I make my motion, I if I can, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to ask city management if we have those two things in place.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I was going to ask them to respond in general. So, Miss Frick, I'll turn it over to you.\nSpeaker 1: Certainly, we did all that during. We did everything there from the reports that we had from 2005 and 2006. And then, of course, when we did the peer review as requests for the city council, things got a little bit worse.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to turn it over to Suzanne Frick to walk us excuse.\nSpeaker 9: Me now and specifically, Mr. Mayor, if I can, and I hope that you answer this, those two specific steps. I know you did the peer review. I know we had a tier two study. We did not have an RFP on the cost to retrofit.\nSpeaker 9: But I'm particularly concerned that if, in fact, we do believe this building is unsafe, did we do these two particular things that you brought to our attention on May 15, 2007, when Christina Anderson was the director of Public Works?\nSpeaker 4: Mayor Members of the Council. Yes. In fact, we did do those items at that time, as you recall. The vulnerability with this building were in the wings and that there was fear that the the wings were potentially unstable.\nSpeaker 4: And that contains our elevator shafts, our stairwells and restrooms. And so, in essence, what we did was a major undertaking within City Hall to move all of our emergency supplies that used to be stored in those wings into the middle of the building.\nSpeaker 4: We informed our employees about evacuation techniques, and we also worked with the fire department to determine what would be the best method to evacuate this building in the event that our stairwells and elevator shafts were unusable. There were some challenges with the floors above the seventh floor that we still were working out the specifics.\nSpeaker 4: Then subsequent to that, as you recall, the Council directed us to prepare that peer review of the seismic analysis. And that peer review has determined that it is no longer just about the wings. It is now about the core of the building.\nSpeaker 4: And that we are a. Finally on notice as of the fall that this building has some serious seismic vulnerabilities and could jeopardize the life and safety of the employees and the visitors in this building. That is what's prompting us to move forward at this point in time.\nSpeaker 4: What I would indicate is that we have evaluated the issue of retrofit versus is new construction. And I want to kind of remind the council to some degree that the retrofitting option basically requires us to go to the voters for a bond measure because there is no funding for a retrofit, whether it is 100 million, 200 million\nSpeaker 4: or 250 million. We don't have that funding. So not only would we be paying the 10 million we're paying today, we could be paying up to an additional 16 million for a bond measure for retrofitting. And what the council has been clear about is that you do not want to fix city hall on the backs of the\nSpeaker 4: taxpayer, that what you have directed us to do is try to develop a scenario that, in fact stays within the amount of money that we're currently spending. And what we're doing is moving forward with the public private partnership because that meets that objective, that there would not be a additional cost beyond what we're paying today to build\nSpeaker 4: a new city hall. So that's the dilemma that we're faced with and that's why we're moving forward. I'd also note that what we're doing right now is merely testing the market to determine whether or not the notion of this public private partnership and staying within the amount of money we spend today is feasible in the private market\nSpeaker 4: . And that's what this RFP is doing. Once we determine it is or is not feasible, if it's feasible, great, we'll have a partner. Then we embark upon our public process to vision city hall and figure out what the configuration and the design is going to be.\nSpeaker 4: And there will be an extensive public process if it is not feasible to stay within our means. We're going to have to come back to the council and then we will have to discuss the option of going out to a bond to deal with this issue.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. I appreciate that. A couple of if I can, Mr. Mayor, a couple follow up questions. One is that I think residents are asking why it takes $1,000,000 to find out if there's a market for this, since there obviously is a market out there because we have a building across the street.\nSpeaker 9: The P3 or the P3 law expires in 2017 statewide. So it needs to be obviously renewed. But we know that there that there is a market out there. So the million dollars is, I think, the bigger question. The second question is, and I and as somebody who has worked diligently in the city to try to get residents\nSpeaker 9: ready for an earthquake, if, in fact and I do believe that we have a seismic problem here. When are we think heating this building? Because the scenarios that I've been given all the time in the handout is that tomorrow, Calgary, that they are it will take best case scenario to do a development five years from the time\nSpeaker 9: that you get your proposals. Seven years is realistic according to your slide presentation. In ten years, if in fact this is in the condition in a seismically and safe. And as you say, Suzanne, the city has been put on notice.\nSpeaker 9: Why aren't we? Why aren't we backing up a little bit and making plans to relocate staff and get them out of this building instead of waiting to go through a consultant process and go through the machinations and waiting for a new council to come out.\nSpeaker 9: So, you know, I'm being I'm being sincere. I'm not you know, I'm trying to get. If you really do think this place is and you keep saying we've been put on notice, then why would we keep people here from for four or five years or even two years more?\nSpeaker 4: We believe we need to move expeditiously, and that is why we're proceeding down the path where we're going down with the council support and we're engaging the council every step of the way. It is a risk that we are taking.\nSpeaker 4: There's no question about that. That's why we want to continue on an expedited process to relocate. City Hall is going to be a tremendous expense, and that may in fact, be an option that we're going to have to explore.\nSpeaker 4: If when these we go out with the RFP and the proposals come back, and if the scenario is that nobody can deliver us what we're asking for, we may in fact be before the city council asking you to spend money to relocate the employees.\nSpeaker 4: It seems to me we don't know that.\nSpeaker 9: Right. It might be prudent that you work on parallel. Tracks if, in fact, you know, this is going to take until July to come back to Stephen to discuss the feasibility of whether this is feasible. It seems to me that it would be in the best interests of the people who work here, that we are proceeding on\nSpeaker 9: some way to plan to get people out of here. The poll was closed down because it was considered to be seismically unsafe. And because you do have crowds there and they you didn't want to have any difficulties. I would think that if this is in the same and I saw the film, it's called the FCI score on\nSpeaker 9: this, if in fact, this truly is is in the state that you're saying, then I'm wondering why we would keep open and risk the same thing that might happen at a pool structure that might happen here. And I understand because of the pool in the earth.\nSpeaker 9: But again, if if this is considered to be so seismically unsafe.\nSpeaker 4: Let me jump at the Belmont Pool. And the condition of city hall are two completely different scenarios. The Belmont Pool is on basically quicksand and is a 5.0 earthquake could topple that building. So that's what necessitated the immediate evacuation.\nSpeaker 4: City Hall, on the other hand, has some seismic vulnerabilities. We are taking a risk, but it is a calculated risk at this point in time. And so we don't believe that it is such a risk that necessitates the immediate evacuation of this building.\nSpeaker 9: Well, what timeframe do you think they. We have to evacuate people, because by your own report, you put this city hall on fault areas. That's what you handed out to council, saying it, showing the city hall being in a Long Beach area fault.\nSpeaker 4: I don't think we've said that city hall is on a fault. The Southern California is peppered with faults and that this particular building is not in a fault.\nSpeaker 9: Well, perhaps that was the error of the former public works director because she has it. And the city hall seismic evaluation pointing out our vulnerability because of the fault. So I don't know why that was in there if we're not at.\nSpeaker 4: But I think it's the proximity of the faults. Just we've got the newport-inglewood, we've got the Palos Verdes, we've got a number of faults that are directly connected to Long Beach.\nSpeaker 9: Well, personally, I you know, I'd like to hear some more from the public, too, but I really would hope that instead of spending the money to find out if the market's out there and by the way, was the newspaper correct that if people answered this RFP, that the city will be financially obligated to pay them for answering\nSpeaker 9: it? Or was Mr. Bradley incorrect because he put that in his table?\nSpeaker 4: When this matter was brought before the council, we there was a discussion about a stipend for the developer teams and that stipend would be paid by the winning developer. So that in essence the council authorized 500,000 per up to 500, let me say it that way for up to 500,000 per development team that would be payable by\nSpeaker 4: the winning proposal. Now if in fact the Council does not choose, we get the proposals in, there's a viable proposal, the council decides not to proceed. Then there is a remote possibility that the city would have to pay that.\nSpeaker 4: But we believe if in fact this is successful and we find a developer who can deliver this, then the city will not be paying the 1.5.\nSpeaker 9: But the city would be obligated according because we certainly haven't we don't get to see the RFP before you send it out. So I don't know what the language is, but my understanding now is that the city would be oddly so.\nSpeaker 9: The future council would be obligated to pay the winning development team if in fact it chooses not to go forth at that point.\nSpeaker 4: I'm not following the question.\nSpeaker 9: Well, are they going to get paid whether or not the city decides what if the city does what this news council decides in July? I know they don't want to do this. And you've picked a winning proposal that you've brought to city council.\nSpeaker 9: What happens with the obligation in the RFP to pay the winning.\nSpeaker 2: Team.\nSpeaker 7: Council memberships? The current posture is that if the city issues an RFP and cancels the RFP before the submittals are required to be received, then no stipend is payable. If the RFP continues and we receive submittals from the three short bidders, those submittals that are qualified under the requirements of the RFP would then be eligible for a\nSpeaker 7: statement. If we are unable to come to an agreement with the preferred proposer, then there is a possibility the city would be responsible for the or for the stipend. But if we proceed to closing with the preferred proposer, then the preferred proposer will pay the stipend.\nSpeaker 9: And Mr. Conway, if the city chooses, not after they've done. Can you tell me what the maximum obligation of the city would be.\nSpeaker 7: If we would be currently liable up to a half a million dollars per bidder if we received three qualified bids as a result of the response to the RFP.\nSpeaker 9: So potentially, if the next council decides not to go forth and you had responsive bidders, it could be 1.5 million that the city would have to pay for them. Taking the time to respond.\nSpeaker 7: That could be an outcome.\nSpeaker 9: So I'd hold off on a motion until we hear more from my colleagues and from the public.\nSpeaker 5: Councilor Longo.\nSpeaker 8: That's okay, Mr. Mayor. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: You passed?\nSpeaker 8: Well, it was the cup that could hit the cue button. It wasn't me.\nSpeaker 5: Mr. Dome.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just a couple of questions here.\nSpeaker 0: So, in essence, what I'm hearing, I'm hearing here tonight, if we if we suspend the.\nSpeaker 10: Process, we suspend identifying our potential solution. Is that really where you're coming from?\nSpeaker 4: That's precisely where we're coming from.\nSpeaker 10: Correct. Because we don't know that a new building or a three piece is the solution.\nSpeaker 0: This is a search.\nSpeaker 10: This is an investigation. Am I correct?\nSpeaker 4: That is correct.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: And what about speaking specifically to the retrofit option?\nSpeaker 10: I know the $160 Million number has been thrown out. How hard is that number?\nSpeaker 0: What experts have.\nSpeaker 10: Looked at it? How confident are you that that is the number? Should we be doing something now that.\nSpeaker 0: Might put us on a dual track where we want to look.\nSpeaker 10: At a retrofit?\nSpeaker 7: Councilmember O'Donnell The original estimate for the retrofit, including both code required and ADA, required upgrades for temporary relocation space, for soft costs, for design, for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Back in 2006 was estimated by the same engineering firm that conducted the Tier one and Tier two study.\nSpeaker 7: And at that time, in 2006, the estimate was $119 million. For discussion purposes, we brought that number forward to 2013 at a 5% annual increase, which brought us to the 100 and I think $74 million range. I think Ms..\nSpeaker 7: Frick's comment that the order of magnitude of that retrofit clearly makes that an unacceptable alternative for us, as we don't have anything near 100 to $200 million to focus on a retrofit that would simply saddle the residents of Long Beach with additional debt and continue.\nSpeaker 10: I to get the debt part. So I'm just more I just want to be confident that we've really looked at the retrofit component comprehensively. Listen, I'm not in favor of stopping tonight's stopping the process from moving forward. I just wonder, you know, is there something we should look at?\nSpeaker 0: Did this $160 million proposal estimate, did that undergo peer review?\nSpeaker 7: Councilmember O'Donnell I don't believe that went under peer review, but it was conducted by a structural engineer.\nSpeaker 4: And council member. What we anticipate is that that is likely on the low end of the retrofitting costs, because, again, that was based upon the retrofitting associated with the wings, the the Tier one and Tier two analysis. And given the new analysis that's been done that is related to the core of the building, we recognize there will\nSpeaker 4: likely be additional retrofitting that would be triggered. So that's why we're saying it. If it's 160 million or if it's 200 million, that is a significant burden that we would be looking to fund.\nSpeaker 0: Right. But I guess what I'm telling you is what I want to be.\nSpeaker 10: Confident is that the number is 160 million. That that's where.\nSpeaker 4: We are very confident on the low end of the number that in fact, that 160 million is the minimum amount that it would cost to retrofit. We, in fact, believe it could likely be more.\nSpeaker 11: Can you can you.\nSpeaker 7: If I could jump in, since 2006, there have been significant changes to both the building code and the seismic requirements.\nSpeaker 10: And every year there will be I get it. The minute you know, you're after your buildings built, it's out of code because the code changes. So I get that. That doesn't mean that there's not a significant problem.\nSpeaker 3: Well, I understand it.\nSpeaker 0: Could you put something.\nSpeaker 10: Together for me so that I can be confident that we've really looked at the retrofit concept and it's just not viable?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, we can put together what a viable estimate for the potential retrofit.\nSpeaker 10: Right. And if you have to consult with somebody and it costs you a little bit of money, to me, that's not, you know.\nSpeaker 2: Well, made out.\nSpeaker 10: Of reason.\nSpeaker 2: So by all means, thank you.\nSpeaker 5: That's remember Lowenthal.\nSpeaker 8: I think my buttons broken. I'm not cued up.\nSpeaker 4: Sorry.\nSpeaker 5: I'm really sorry. Your button's broken. We'll try to. We'll try to rectify that. So you do not want to be calling?\nSpeaker 8: No.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. All right. Do we have a motion here?\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Let's go to public comment.\nSpeaker 5: Not without a motion.\nSpeaker 2: Well.\nSpeaker 0: Well, maybe. Maybe city management.\nSpeaker 10: Can help here. Listen, I'm not interested in stopping the process here this evening. I want to move forward. I do want to get something back from you that speaks to the effort that has gone into identifying the potential retrofit costs.\nSpeaker 10: So I don't know if we'd have to do a receiver file here or or the motion would be just ask city management to to further analyze the costs associated with the potential retrofit and get back to council. I know it's through a memo or what.\nSpeaker 6: That's just that work for you?\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember We're more than willing to return to council with an estimate on the retrofit.\nSpeaker 5: So there's a motion.\nSpeaker 11: There's a motion and a second council. Boston.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. I'd like to piggyback on Councilmember O'Donnell's motion and possibly offer a substitute, because from what I've heard here, and I do understand that we are looking at the feasibility of this public private partnership for a new civic center.\nSpeaker 10: But and I do agree that we need to also be on a parallel track with the looking at the retrofit option. But have we discussed a public private partnership for a retrofit? Is that a possibility in any way, shape or form?\nSpeaker 10: I think one of the public speakers mentioned that a little earlier. And the notion that we need to look at.\nSpeaker 7: Councilmember a public private partnership for retrofit would still. Let's assume it's $100 million or $150 million. It would still require an additional annual payment above our existing $10.8 million. And and that would require additional funding through some source, whether it be the residents from a bond measure or taking other funds from other necessary programs.\nSpeaker 7: So I don't know if that's a viable alternative. We have to take the existing annual expense that we have for this civic center and put it into another civic center instead of adding on to costs of the existing civic center.\nSpeaker 10: So we have a significant footprint here where we are today. We have a old courthouse. We have successor agency properties downtown that could be identified as a new potentially new civic center. A new civic center. I think there are.\nSpeaker 10: I just don't think we've looked at all of the the options and variables. But I also wanted to comment on the the the original motion. I'm not interested in the new council having an opportunity. I will just say I disagree.\nSpeaker 10: I think the new council won't get a pass on this issue. The new council that will be seated in July will have to deal with this issue and wrestle with this issue issue. And it will be a priority for us to wrestle with because of the seismic safety issues that have been outlined here.\nSpeaker 10: And so I do agree we need to move forward. I just think we need to look at move forward with every option available. I think we need to have a little bit more of a robust public outreach as well to meetings, in my opinion, just stating the case that it's not enough, not when you look at an\nSpeaker 10: investment with the gravity that we are going to undergo with the new civic center or retrofit. Either way, the public needs to be more engaged, more involved. And it was noted that nobody showed up to the the last meeting, a public meeting, or it was that attendance was likely it was light.\nSpeaker 10: I personally had a district events and big district events going on and that conflicted with that. And so there are a lot of activities going on here in the city. And so with that said, I think we should really do more to to to do outreaching and give the public more of an opportunity to be involved.\nSpeaker 10: I'd be really interested in hearing about feedback. What was the public input during those public meetings regarding? The new civic center. Is there any, you know, quantifiable data? Were there surveys? Where was the online outreach and what were the results?\nSpeaker 10: I mean, I would love to get that as well. So with that, I think I'm going to support the motion on the floor.\nSpeaker 11: Councilmember Shipp, Skip.\nSpeaker 9: I think Mr. Austin has a good point, that one of the things that this council has not done, we've not really had a thorough discussion about all the options, including simply relocating. And we also have not seen whether or not what the options are out there about selling the courthouse property to use to finance it for any\nSpeaker 9: kind of retrofit or any improvements for a civic center. We've just really not have that discussion. And in looking at the well, the RFQ, that didn't seem to be something that was even entertained. Any discussion about retrofitting is also not in there.\nSpeaker 9: So none none of the three qualifying groups actually put in any kind of proposal for qualifications for retrofit. And so we really haven't looked at the other scenarios and we really haven't had a full council meeting on the financing.\nSpeaker 9: I know you talk about the voters would have to approve a bond, but we've not even talked about why that would be required and what aspect of this whole proposal would require that to be done versus going the P3 route.\nSpeaker 9: So that's I think that's the other thing. The public is kind of responding to Mr. Austin, that there's they're saying that they don't think enough information has been given to the public. You're asking the public to come out and talk about something that's an extremely kind of amorphous situation.\nSpeaker 9: And unless you give them the information, they they really can't engage and they're not being asked to. As we have had in visioning sessions and others, they're not being asked to put things on paper. They're asked to be they're being asked verbally, you know, what do you think we should do?\nSpeaker 9: Well, you know, that's that's an extremely vague question. And so the answers are extremely vague as well. I will tell you about the notification on the the public meetings. I had a response from a member of press saying that they were only told two days before the those the first public hearing actually took place.\nSpeaker 9: So that makes it difficult to to get those announcements out in the press. So I would hope in this the motion that Mr. O'Donnell made and I second it, that we will get I would ask if city management give a little bit more information not only about the cost to retrofit, but how would such retrofit be financed\nSpeaker 9: ? Because I don't know that we've had that discussion. And could that include selling the courthouse to be able to finance such retrofitting? Because certainly we don't want to increase taxes on anyone and obligations, but we've never really had any of that discussion about how else we could pay for the retrofitting.\nSpeaker 9: I do know that there are FEMA, there are FEMA funds available to many of the cities that have undergone retrofitting. There's there's city halls have have received some assistance from FEMA to do that. So but in those cases, I do believe it's because FEMA indicated there city halls were called essential facilities.\nSpeaker 9: They had emergency communications facilities in those facilities. And we don't. So I don't I don't know that we would probably qualify on that basis. So I would just hope we get that additional information. When you're talking back to us about retrofitting, how such retrofitting could be possibly financed, that would it would help.\nSpeaker 9: Otherwise, we're just we get the information and then we've had no information back about how we'd go ahead and pay for it if we move forward.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Vice Mayor, I just for the record, like to clarify what the exact motion is, as my notes indicate that it's a request for a report on the retrofit costs and then councilmember ships key is has made some additional changes.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if that's a friendly amendment or if so fall to the body.\nSpeaker 11: Because we're ships.\nSpeaker 10: I guess my only I just wonder if you're getting ahead of us here because I mean if the retrofit is so expensive, the cost benefit isn't going to be there to retrofit because then you then you'd had the direction of a new building.\nSpeaker 10: So well, because we want to know what the what has gone on with regard to researching the retrofit. Alternative. That's that's purely my motive and what the costs might be. So, you know, they had some information in there about how we might finance it.\nSpeaker 10: I guess that's fine, too, I guess.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker 11: So they're going to motion in a second on that counts.\nSpeaker 10: And then I like to offer a friendly amendment to include the public the the exploring the public private partnership with the retrofit auction as well if.\nSpeaker 11: I think that's part of the I that will be part of the moonshot.\nSpeaker 0: If we can include that.\nSpeaker 10: As part of the financing component. Yeah. Okay. I just want to be clear. Okay.\nSpeaker 11: So there's a there's a motion on the floor. I'm going to make a couple of comments. We're going to put up to the public. I think what's important for us to note is at least, at least for me, is at the end of the day, this starts and begins.\nSpeaker 11: You know, this starts and ends as a public safety issue. And I think what's important for us to remember is I think everyone is interested, no matter what side of the issue you're on, is that we do have serious issues with this building, with the structure of the building and the safety of the people that are in\nSpeaker 11: this building should always be our top priority. And so I want to make sure that we are that that is what the debate is revolved around. There's different ways of getting getting there and creating a safer environment for our employees.\nSpeaker 11: But that certainly needs to be at the forefront of our discussion. And also briefly, it's my understanding that. Mr.. Mr. West. From conversation that you and I had about the community outreach process is that there is going to be additional meetings.\nSpeaker 1: There continues to be additional needs right now.\nSpeaker 11: Because I think that that's I mean, I think that there's been that something that I have heard in the community, I think that's important for us to make sure that we get out there if we have even that schedule.\nSpeaker 11: I mean, the sooner that we let the public know when these meetings are and they certainly should be throughout the city, I think that's going to be important so that people can ask the questions. And I mean, I think for a lot of people, this is probably instructive as well to just get information out there.\nSpeaker 11: And so the more of those community meetings that we have, the better. And and lastly, on the visioning piece, and I just want to clarify this as well, it's my understanding that there would be an extensive if we decided to move forward and we haven't even decided to move forward on this type of a plan.\nSpeaker 11: If we were to decide to move forward, there would be an extension extensive, I imagine many month, year long visioning process that would go out to every neighborhood, involve all sorts of of communities to envision what we would even do on this on the site.\nSpeaker 11: Is that correct?\nSpeaker 4: Absolutely correct. That, in essence, before we go out with a comprehensive visioning process and get everybody's hopes and dreams alive, we need to know whether or not we have a developer team who, in fact, can deliver a project for us.\nSpeaker 4: And it is absolutely critical that before we embark upon that extensive outreach process, we have that developer in hand. So that developer is in fact listening to the input and participating in that extensive public outreach. So again, really, this step that we're taking is really to determine what we want to do, whether or not it's feasible and\nSpeaker 4: doesn't.\nSpeaker 11: The way I interpret the Senate budget, doesn't this step essentially provide us an option? Correct. That doesn't mean that's the option that we will take, but it provides an option. It's my understanding that the issue would have to come before the council many times between now on numerous occasions, including any future council, on a variety of different\nSpeaker 11: decisions that would come before, on, on, on funding, on the project, on the visioning process, on a variety of different questions. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 4: Yes. And what I like what I like to remind people of is that we started this process back in 2005 when with the first analysis, 25, 26, and we're still at it. So this is really spanning multiple city councils who have participated in this process.\nSpeaker 4: And the Future City Council, in fact, will be significantly engaged in the completion if in fact, we move forward on this project.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. And then my last point is going to be and again, I had some conversations with with Mr. West about this. But I do think and I do believe in reviewing the engineering studies, that we do have a problem in this building.\nSpeaker 11: It's a serious problem. It's one that we should take seriously. And I think that, Mr. West, as as we do these reports and as you come back with more information, we should be looking at what are what are other options are, for whatever reason, we go through this process and we find out what our options are.\nSpeaker 11: And this council or future council rejects those options. Or the option doesn't pan pan out, because we could come back with information that says this is just not financially possible or this won't work. For whatever reason, we still have a building that is structurally unsafe for our employees, and at the end of the day, we have to\nSpeaker 11: fix our problem. And so we need to start. And I think we have already. I know. Ms.. Frick, you said that we don't have an official plan, but I know you guys have already had discussions about what other options would be, what leasing would look like, which would be very expensive, but what leasing would look like in\nSpeaker 11: many other buildings, or if we'd have to relocate to other parts of the city. So that piece of the of the discussion is critical, I think. So let's bring some of that discussion, I think, to the forefront. We should do them parallelly, because I don't want to get to a point where one thing is rejected and then\nSpeaker 11: we have no plan. And I think we're going to have hopefully a couple a couple of plans in the works. Thank you. We'll go and go to the public or you have another comment?\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, I have a couple of quick questions. Can you please then enlighten me and the public what this public process is that you're doing right now? I mean, what is it that you're asking the public to give input on what they should tell the developers, how they should go and write an RF P because they're not being\nSpeaker 9: given the opportunity for input as to what should be done. Since you're since the purpose of the RFP is to go find out what can be done.\nSpeaker 7: Councilwoman Chips Key In the RFP, we have a somewhat abbreviated process that we're following that is intended to provide the short listed bidders the requirements of. Both Civic Center and the port in in the RFP. So we're going to be providing them not only programs but the functional needs of the civic center, both from the city hall\nSpeaker 7: perspective and the library perspective. The port has their own needs assessment and 30 year demand analysis, and we're converting that into a document that will hopefully inform the short bidders on how to come back to us with a financially feasible project.\nSpeaker 7: And so the outreach to the public is to inform them that we are proceeding with this process and that we are not we don't have a project yet. We are only on the pathway of selecting a partner, a development partner.\nSpeaker 7: The idea being to educate and inform the public that this is the process we're going through. And this is just two of probably countless outreach meetings that will occur as this project progresses.\nSpeaker 9: Well, in fairness, I don't think that's what the public understood, because we've got a great deal of people in the library community who thought it was an opportunity to come and give input, particularly because in the RFQ there was a figure put in there about what the in you and I.\nSpeaker 9: Mr.. Conway We've had discussions on this where that figure came from about what should be the size of a new main library. And so when people are coming this morning, they really thought that it was to give input as to what direction to go.\nSpeaker 9: And I share and I think I've shared this with Mr. West. Unfortunately, I've heard from residents who overheard staff afterwards kind of ridiculing the people who had come up to say something by saying, Haha, I guess we got your our marching orders.\nSpeaker 9: And these are credible residents.\nSpeaker 1: I have to interrupt that. That is adamantly false. That's not the case. We listened to the tapes and that is not that comment is not attributed to us.\nSpeaker 9: It wasn't said on tape, Mr. West.\nSpeaker 1: We listen to that. Listen to tape. We heard the comment is not attributed to staff. I have to adamantly protest that.\nSpeaker 9: Was it attributed to the consultant staff?\nSpeaker 1: No.\nSpeaker 9: Oh, who was it then? Because it was not. It was not. I mean, because you're you're making the question about public input. And to have people come to something and then have them feel that their input doesn't really matter.\nSpeaker 1: And so, again, that's the statement you're referring to is false.\nSpeaker 9: All right. The second thing that said, Mr. West, that there's some additional when are the additional public sessions going to be on this aspect?\nSpeaker 7: If I could add to that, we have been working closely, not only with the Library Foundation, but a consultant hired by the Library Foundation to better describe and define the library of the future. That information is going to be in our data room, which is accessible by all of the short bidders so that they can understand the\nSpeaker 7: position of the foundation and their consultant. So we believe we reached out to them. We believe that we are working together with them to better define what the future library looks like. And I'm hopeful that that cooperative spirit proceeds into the future and as that needs assessment gets translated into a design, is when we're going to go\nSpeaker 7: out to the public and seek their input from the entire entire entitlement process, which will be nine months to a year.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. Well, to questions, Mr. West mentioned the regret to Mr. Garcia that there is going to be some additional sessions. Do we know when they are so we can let the public know?\nSpeaker 1: We councilmembers. We continue to stand ready to respond to any member of the community, any community group, any council group to appear and go to any meetings we've done to several already. And I'm getting direction from the council that we may want to go out and schedule some of our own, but certainly we're out.\nSpeaker 7: There with.\nSpeaker 1: Our website volunteering to go to any public meeting desired and we stand ready to go to anyone.\nSpeaker 9: All right. And last but not least, Mr. Garcia brought something up. I don't think the rest of the council was ever aware of. You have worked out scenarios about leasing other property to move.\nSpeaker 1: I think the city council has heard those scenarios.\nSpeaker 9: Know the cost of leasing. Yes, absolutely.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. We can do those, too.\nSpeaker 9: Well, that was that was you know, that you included that in the cost for relocation, but you didn't talk about what potential buildings you're looking at to lease.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, the council's been informed of that and we'd be happy to provide that to you.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, please. I would like to see the memo about the locations that have met. Identified.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. We're going to go to the public. Please come forward.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Mr. Vice Mayor. Gary Shelton, again. I didn't rush down because I think my comments are most important. I just have to be somewhere else in a few minutes. So I wanted to get my my thoughts in. I'm in favor of the motion as it stands right now.\nSpeaker 1: Anything that can give us an insight as to what seems to be some of the missing pieces of this conversation is welcomed. I did want to express just sitting there listening as closely as I could, that there are the cross purposes are being loudly spoken and there are there are some folks that seem to want things both\nSpeaker 1: ways, and it really can't work that way. What I'm what I'm talking about, I get to a couple of specifics is related to the idea of of of a retrofit financing would have to go into bond issuing and and be approved by the voters and by the issuers of the bonds that's spoken as if that's something bad\nSpeaker 1: . I don't know that it's something bad. We have no no concept of why that would be an improper way to move forward. Maybe it's the best way. I really don't know. That's never been elucidated or there's been no light put on that.\nSpeaker 1: The other cross purpose that I heard was over and over was that this this RFP process is just a a search that we really don't know what the outcome is going to be. We don't know if it's going to be feasible or not.\nSpeaker 1: That's looming large in the discussion, however. Then just five or 10 minutes later, Missouri State but not moving forward is a remote possibility. So like which is it?\nSpeaker 6: Is it this is just.\nSpeaker 1: Going up in the air and we don't know what's going to happen or is it not moving forward is a remote possibility. Which way is it? So learning more about the retrofit is going to help us understand that the the the remote possibility, by the way, was in the context of the $500,000 stipend.\nSpeaker 1: So I appreciate the motion and the second and the discussion and I hope it passes. Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Good evening, Vice Mayor Garcia. City Council members, city staff. My name is Margaret Smith. I am a resident of the third district and I am speaking on behalf of the Long Beach Public Library Foundation. We appreciate the difficulty of these decisions and we respect your need to go forward.\nSpeaker 4: From a cost and safety standpoint. But from the very beginning, the foundation has asked for an open, robust and transparent process for getting community input. Not just library supporters, but everyone's input about what they want for the future of their civic center.\nSpeaker 4: And we have also voiced our concerns about the aggressive timeframe of this process. The request for proposals, as Mr. Conway has shown in many of his public community sort of outreach efforts, goes out February 28th or let's say March 1st, three months later.\nSpeaker 4: Those proposals are due back from our three pre-selected bidder teams. So that's three months to do a monumentally complex proposal. And then a month later in an evening meeting, just like this one on July 1st, city staff is going to come back to you at the city council with the proposed preferred proposed proposal and ask you to\nSpeaker 4: vote on that all in one meeting. And at that July 1st meeting, no one from the public will have seen those three proposals that have come back. And we are making a commitment to this team for a minimum of 30 years.\nSpeaker 4: So with all due respect, Ms.. Frick, when you say we're just testing the waters, we're going to be committing to a team and committing, at least in concept, to a design approach that we are going to have to deal with.\nSpeaker 4: So I respectfully disagree that this is just a testing of the waters. This is a monumentally important decision that will be made July 1st, first with no community public input. If this current schedule goes ahead, we are asking that sometime in that month, between June 1st and July 1st, the public be given access to those proposals so\nSpeaker 4: we can have and make informed input on July 1st. We don't think that there's adequate time in this process for community input, for adequate time to explore all the options and adequate time for the bid teams to create a proposal that a project of this magnitude warrants.\nSpeaker 4: But if we do go forward, we do ask for that public input input in that all important month. We appreciate the respect and consideration that has been shown to us as the Library Foundation by Mr. Conway and Ms. Bodak.\nSpeaker 4: We have not heard anything about negative comments. We have been treated uniformly with respect and we very much appreciate forging this mutual partnership with the city to go forward, whatever you decide. In closing, I would ask two things that the public be given access to this retrofit cost analysis and that any additional public meetings that are going\nSpeaker 4: to be scheduled be done so with adequate publicity and adequate advance notice.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 7: Jim McCabe, retired deputy city attorney. I just wanted to point out to the council who I'm sure has read the February 7th memo. My take on what's in there and what's not in there, what we do not know.\nSpeaker 7: As has been pointed out, whether it is commercially feasible. So the numbers thrown out by Mr. Conway all this time of 12 something million dollars a year.\nSpeaker 0: Are.\nSpeaker 7: Essentially out of thin air unless Mr. Conway tells us where these numbers came from. There are just guesses in the wind. We do not know as well.\nSpeaker 0: Whether.\nSpeaker 7: The project is legal. The memo of February seven implies that California legislation is needed to make it legal, but says nothing about whether that legislation is likely. So we're going to be going a gaily forward without knowing whether we can ever do this project at all.\nSpeaker 7: What we do know is that no California city has ever used this project for a municipal building. What we also know what is known is that.\nSpeaker 0: No North American.\nSpeaker 7: Project has ever shown three PE to work in the long term. How can they? There is enormous difficulty speaking as a as a as a retired lawyer. There is enormous difficulty in defining what the maintenance and care needs for a city hall 40 years in advance are going to be.\nSpeaker 7: There's no idea how this is going to be taken care of. One very big question remains is whether or not the city that all the city property reverts to the taxpayers at the end of the 40 year agreement, or it's a three year agreement or a 38 year agreement.\nSpeaker 7: I've heard all these figures. Mr. Conway has told public meetings this a public meeting this last Saturday, that some property at least was will be owned by the developer at the end of the lease. Is this the old courthouse land and how much is it worth and how much does that figure into the supposed limit of 12\nSpeaker 7: something million dollars a year?\nSpeaker 0: What gives? What's the rush?\nSpeaker 7: The memo suggests more public outreach, yet the council.\nSpeaker 0: Voted to limit.\nSpeaker 7: Public outreach. And I just I'm just baffled by the by the whole process it had. Thank you. I may have. Second, if I if I've had the impression this is a little like the like the Wizard of Oz.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. Thank you, Robert.\nSpeaker 7: I'll. I'll just finish up one sentence. Thank you. Just. Just believe the city manager and Mr. Conway.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. Time's up.\nSpeaker 7: Please don't ask who the man behind the curtain is. Thank you very much for your additional forbearance.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Vice Mayor and City Council. I'm Kerry Gallagher, and I'm the executive director of Housing Long Beach. My address is on file. I just wanted to thank you all for having the opportunity to open up this dialog to the public and with our elected officials.\nSpeaker 4: This is a huge opportunity for a Long Beach. It's a really big decision, and I, along with many residents of the city, have not been entirely clear on how the process has moved forward. So I really appreciate thank Ms..\nSpeaker 4: Gypsy as well as the rest of the Council for having this dialog. So if the Council does decide to move forward with a new civic center, this has an enormous opportunity or even a retrofit. There are enormous opportunities to serve the communities of Long Beach, the community of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 4: And so I'd like to just point out a couple of things that especially jobs and housing advocates have been talking about for some time now and hope will be considered as the dialog moves forward. So from start to finish, this really has multiple spaces in which we can insert as a city community benefits that will improve the\nSpeaker 4: condition of life for our residents. We commend you on recognizing that the project should include a project labor agreement. However, we think we should go even further and include living wages as well as a local hire provision. It makes total sense to hire our residents, especially our low income residents, for the jobs that are going to be\nSpeaker 4: created from this project. And this should be a no brainer to include in the project and in the RFP as it moves forward. Additionally, it's under quite a bit of consideration, from my understanding that housing will be included in the project.\nSpeaker 4: And so as our civic center, as a piece of land that is intended to serve the Long Beach community, there should be affordable housing included. And so we started to have these dialogs with a few of you. We hope to go in much deeper as far as how we can include community benefits in this project.\nSpeaker 4: There are a number of other pieces, not just in jobs and housing, but child friendly resources, gender neutral bathrooms, a library that serves everybody, and a number of things that so many residents have come out to support. And so as housing Long Beach and our coalition of partners, we hope that we can continue this dialog with you\nSpeaker 4: . Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Mr. Vice Mayor?\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Can I just add that.\nSpeaker 10: In the project labor agreement, there is a local hire provision? Yeah, there is. That was written into that message.\nSpeaker 4: Okay.\nSpeaker 10: That's of all the project labor agreements we've done in Long Beach. We've included a local hire provision.\nSpeaker 4: What's the percentage?\nSpeaker 10: You know, I don't know the exact percentage because it depends on the project. Realizing that some projects, some of the trades are far out. You know, you're not going to find the number of pile drivers you need in Long Beach to construct the bridge.\nSpeaker 10: So it's on a trade by trade project by project basis.\nSpeaker 4: And we could have either you or city staff help us get the.\nSpeaker 2: Well.\nSpeaker 11: We'll get you the information. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. My name is Lee Fukui. I live in the Wrigley District, sixth district. I went to the first RFP meeting and I was really dismayed that it was less than half full. Not enough notification, not enough communication about this grand project that we have here.\nSpeaker 0: The Civic Center is going to involve every taxpayer here. And yet these meetings weren't communicated well. And if you look at this whole process has not been communicated well. In fact, if you look at it, everything about it doesn't look right.\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry, but I know you've talked.\nSpeaker 4: About this project.\nSpeaker 0: For years, but it hasn't really been communicated to the public. When I talk to my neighbors about this. They're shocked about what's going on. You know, there's this a multimillion dollar effort here to rebuild civic center. And yet no one really knows about it except for the few here.\nSpeaker 0: What I really want to do is what I really came here was to ask you to support council memberships. KEYES Motion. That this is.\nSpeaker 4: Not fair.\nSpeaker 2: To to the residents.\nSpeaker 0: We don't know what's going on. This talk of RFP and all the money.\nSpeaker 4: It's not making sense first.\nSpeaker 0: At the first meeting, we were told that it was going to cost.\nSpeaker 9: $818.\nSpeaker 0: A square foot. Now we got another thing. Information, $685 a square foot. So, you know, there's these wide and.\nSpeaker 4: Retrofitting wasn't even considered.\nSpeaker 0: It was passed over. And yet every city in Los Angeles.\nSpeaker 4: City Hall.\nSpeaker 0: Pasadena City Hall. Venice City Hall. Venice City Hall went.\nSpeaker 4: Under to.\nSpeaker 0: Seismic retrofit because they experienced two earthquakes. They did not.\nSpeaker 4: Tear anything.\nSpeaker 0: Down. They retrofitted. And yet retrofitting was not even discussed until today. And it's this whole process has been backwards and you need to fix it. You have a second opportunity to do this by. By passing this motion and stalling this.\nSpeaker 0: This is taxpayer money. And we need to know exactly what's being spent and where it's going. Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 0: When he was there. He. Gonzales, I just was on fire. Long term, I guess. Civic Center activist by default. My my whole course is the rooftop, the neglected rooftop that's been on top of the library. That is the whole reason we tried closing the library.\nSpeaker 0: What was that? Six years ago when we had the same surge? A sense of urgency. Oh, there's an the earthquake. The big one's going to come. And we haven't done anything in the past six years now, six months before the mayor is about to go out of office and many of you are leaving.\nSpeaker 0: All of a sudden, that urgency is back. And unlike six months ago or six years ago when it was raining and you had this big dramatic effect of all the rain coming into the library, I don't know that you guys are prepared to show us anything.\nSpeaker 0: I don't think you guys are ready to take the public and say, oh, here's our plan for a new civic center. Here's one how we're going to pay for it. Because, for example, I've heard and I've seen this like weird Twin Towers thing in the press telegram with the port, who's going to pay for that?\nSpeaker 0: And I've heard of this whole P3 is going to pay for it. From a business perspective, you don't get something for nothing. So assuming that the private is going to pay for this public entity, they're not just going to do it for nothing.\nSpeaker 0: They're not they're not doing it out of the generous generosity of their heart. Somebody somebody's got to lose something. And my understanding of how a P3 works is that the private developer will, in the end acquire the property.\nSpeaker 0: I believe that's what the former deputy attorney was just referring to. So before we make that kind of decision where we get rid of public property, probably property that was inherited to the public in 1904 when the land was bequeathed in a will, a very expensive public property, ocean and pine, ocean, Pacific.\nSpeaker 0: I think we need to talk to the public first, and I think that's what we keep on hearing. I'm pretty sure that's what everybody just said, including council memberships key and, you know, a few of the other councilors.\nSpeaker 0: So I don't understand the urgency. I don't understand the haste. I've been here for a long time now, six years, and I've been wanting to talk about the Civic Center. I've been wanting to have this big, transparent discussion.\nSpeaker 0: You guys know me by now. I've done this many times, and yet I haven't had anything yet. You guys have always moved forward, you know, I didn't expect to have and I'm sure you guys remember a team of architects actually draw up a proposal.\nSpeaker 0: I had no idea where that was going to come from. Are you kidding me? Like, I'm not qualified to come up with a proposal for how we're going to readapt to the main library. But they are. And I think you guys should take a look at that before you decide in the next five months, before you leave\nSpeaker 0: office, that, you know, it's absolutely, absolutely for certain that we have to destroy and rebuild an entire new library with magic, imaginary money that's supposed to come from the port, which is a big yes or no. Maybe we need to, before going to the public, know for sure how we're going to pay for it.\nSpeaker 0: BE And I say that also because we haven't yet paid for the current one that we're not taking care of. Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. All next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. My name is Melinda Romney and i'm president of Long Beach Heritage.\nSpeaker 2: I live in the Bluff Park area.\nSpeaker 4: I we believe the city needs to take a longer.\nSpeaker 2: Term view of this project. The citizens of Long Beach have a more thorough.\nSpeaker 4: Need to have a more.\nSpeaker 0: Thorough understanding.\nSpeaker 4: Of the rationale and why this has.\nSpeaker 2: Been such a hurried up process. The focus seems to be on the problems of the.\nSpeaker 0: Structure.\nSpeaker 4: Rather than on the most equitable.\nSpeaker 0: And possibly more visionary solutions. We have heard several figures on the cost of.\nSpeaker 4: Retrofitting.\nSpeaker 0: And they were.\nSpeaker 4: Dismissed as too costly or prohibitive.\nSpeaker 0: We have not seen a plan that included both retrofit and adaptive reuse.\nSpeaker 2: The City of Long Beach deserves to see a.\nSpeaker 4: Detailed.\nSpeaker 0: Report that includes both.\nSpeaker 2: Of these items.\nSpeaker 0: Our elected.\nSpeaker 4: Officials need to demonstrate to their constituents.\nSpeaker 0: And their.\nSpeaker 4: Staff that they and their staff are carefully.\nSpeaker 0: Reviewing all the available options for our civic center. Long Beach Heritage.\nSpeaker 4: Supports suspending this for the.\nSpeaker 0: Prime or postponing it.\nSpeaker 4: And we thank.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman Lipski for bringing this up. Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you very much. Speaker.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Vice Mayor and council members. My name is Matt Eichner. My address is on record. I had a whole other thing planned because I really wanted to have this postponed. You and I were going to come up here.\nSpeaker 11: Real quick, just if you're going to speak. Would you mind queuing up if you plan on speaking on the item so we can get to it quicker? No other no other speakers on the item. Okay. Please queue up.\nSpeaker 11: Please continue.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So I originally was we I'm sorry. I wanted this whole process slowed down. I was going to come out to public comment actually tonight. And then I discovered that this was agenda. And I'm very grateful for that.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you very much. I was at the library meeting on the very first one on the 25th and or the meeting at the library. And Mike Conway shared and Amy had shared a lot of numbers and the timeline, and we were all shocked by the timeline because it suddenly was very rushed is based on this motion\nSpeaker 4: tonight. And I guess I'm asking you a question. Are you guys slowing it down? The RFP is going to be released on the 28th or the first that's still going to happen. Is that or is this slowing that down?\nSpeaker 4: Is that process getting slowed down from this?\nSpeaker 11: According to the motion right now, the process is moving forward at the same time that's been set out, but there'll be additional information brought to the council.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. And I'm also concerned about the additional information because like I like Lee, it said that at the meeting on the 25th, $818 a square foot for retrofit is what was presented, whereas for 54 brand new build was the other number presented.\nSpeaker 4: And that number has always stayed constant, although that's the one that we possibly can't really know. And retrofitting is something that has been done in other civics city halls and as Lee had pointed out as well. Sorry if I am bouncing off of him.\nSpeaker 4: And anyways, my our concern is that this number that we keep hearing which dropped to 685 and then tonight, I think it was another number that was lowered. These numbers sound made up and based on some calculations from eight years ago from one company, and it just seems like this information is not necessarily good or accurate to\nSpeaker 4: what really is the case. And I don't understand why an RFP also wouldn't be released concurrently with the new versus the retrofit. I mean, why wouldn't you get both information? I mean, maybe that's what the motion is anyways.\nSpeaker 4: I'm just concerned. I wanted it to slow down. I was really hoping that the motion, as it originally was, would stick. Since it's not, I do appreciate that you're looking at the retrofit as all and we really do feel that this has not been brought to transparency as it should be.\nSpeaker 4: And there is a lot of suspicion and we hear lots of rumors as to why it's moving so quickly. And a lot of it has to do with the election, and we don't want that to be true. And I think I have one last thought that I wanted to say.\nSpeaker 4: Oh, Mr. West, I actually heard on my way to the garage the I believe it was the the woman who was running the RFP, I don't know what it's called, the consulting firm, talking to what I believe was the developers and they kind of she said, what are your marching?\nSpeaker 4: You know, your marching orders? And they kind of jokingly said, Oh, yeah, I put in this and put in that. And maybe, you know, it was light and on the way to the restaurant that they were going through or whatever.\nSpeaker 4: And I don't know who exactly it was, but I heard it and it was it did make me feel like this is a joke. Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Rick Ilitch addresses on file. You know, first of all, I want to say respectfully that I acknowledge the pressure that you as the council are under. Having sat there for eight years, I know that everything could come at you quite quickly and decisions get made quite quickly.\nSpeaker 4: I know that a lot of times staff presents things in certain ways, and you're comfortable with that. But the public is being very vocal. I would like to remind you of everybody seen the movie Chicago. There's the song.\nSpeaker 4: Give them the old razzle dazzle. Well, that's quite appropriate. Here again, this reminds me so much. And I and I want to say that I respect the job that you do. I mean, you're defending what you have to do or what you feel you're supposed to do, but you have a job to do.\nSpeaker 4: And your job is to question everything that they put in front of you so that the people that you represent are satisfied with the outcome of that. And I would hope that there will be a substitute motion on this to stop this and make sure that everybody is informed to the best of your ability.\nSpeaker 4: You know, what is the right I know what the rush is. I'm not going to stand up here and criticize anybody. But, you know, I just I have to say that this smells just like the 2001 Long Beach Airport project that was pushed down the throats of council, who really didn't take the time to understand the implications\nSpeaker 4: . And that resulted in six years, six years of council debate and lawsuits before we finally reached consensus and did it right. So now everybody is happy and proud of that outcome. I hope that you consider doing the same thing.\nSpeaker 4: I will say that one, two, three, four council members had a comment on this the last time I was here and we talked about this sushi. You couldn't stop talking about it. Seize the opportunity. Hardly ever. This hardly ever presents itself, you know?\nSpeaker 4: I mean, don't you care? Is aren't you interested in the outcome? Don't you think that the public that put you there deserves a right to participate in such an enormous project? You know, here's what I'm hearing, Suzanne. You said that the peer review was done and now the entire building is in jeopardy.\nSpeaker 4: Is that because of new physical changes to the structure, because of the land that we're on, or is it because of higher standards within the industry? You know, I could not construct my reconstruct my house with the design that I did in 1988 because of standards.\nSpeaker 4: Is that what we're talking about? You can't do the double speak. You've got to ask for the study session, provide the information to the community and to the council, and then let's make a decision to move forward.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 0: Joel Weinstein, 4000 Linden Avenue. I wrote a rather irate letter to you earlier this afternoon, and I don't know whether I should retracted or emphasize it. The problem is the decision you took on the 3rd of December. It's not that the project is bad.\nSpeaker 0: It's not that the project did not have sufficient public input or in fact, contradicted public input. Those are big problems, but they're not the biggest problem. The biggest problem on December 3rd is you opted deliberately for a decision procedure.\nSpeaker 0: That said, we do not want to look at alternatives. We have a defined problem and we insist on grabbing just the first alternative put on the plate and to reject and blind ourselves to any information on anything else.\nSpeaker 0: That's the basic of what you did on December 3rd. And until you produce a motion that looks at all alternatives, unbiased way that will solve the problem. There's really no satisfactory action here. Because the prime legacy of this process is not going to be a building or a specific rehousing of our headquarters and our city hall staff\nSpeaker 0: . It's going to be the decision method that you are sending as the message of your preferred decision methods. And I was really irate not only as an ordinary homeowner and taxpayer of your refusal to look at alternatives, but also as a math and logic, Ph.D. Who knows a little bit about modern decision analysis?\nSpeaker 0: And what does that modern decision analysis tell you? What common sense has told people who are solving problems for thousands of years that the first step in a rational decision procedure is to look at a spectrum of alternatives.\nSpeaker 0: Like What would it be to have an alternative building somewhere else in town? You go by Douglas Park and they're saying, Come build here. This is a project that you supported. Why isn't there an alternative that's looking at Douglas Park, among other places?\nSpeaker 0: You have people here that brag about how we're a digital city. What about the Internet age alternative, where instead of cramming workers expansively all together into one big, vulnerable building, you put them in distributed neighborhoods, centers economically. And this is not feeling this is how I've been working for the state of California for over ten years as\nSpeaker 0: a member of a six member team, which reports to six different workplaces up and down the state. And we're in constant communication thanks to modern telecom. So please, if you really value your legacy, take something like this motion.\nSpeaker 0: It is a lifeline to save the legacy that you will be stuck with from December 3rd if you don't do something.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 10: Hi. Tom Stout.\nSpeaker 0: And I did attend the meeting.\nSpeaker 10: At the Water, or I guess it was the water.\nSpeaker 0: Department, and there were more questions.\nSpeaker 10: Asked than there were legitimate answers given.\nSpeaker 5: I mean, you need to slow.\nSpeaker 10: This train down.\nSpeaker 0: The public input has been drastic. Li reduced. I mean, if you subtract.\nSpeaker 10: The organizations.\nSpeaker 0: From the library, city employees and developers, there couldn't have been more than ten or 12 people at that meeting, and there were even less at the first meeting. You need to start thinking about and one thing that the IRP has gone out, I would like an RFP from a legitimate company that does retrofitting, not some pie in\nSpeaker 0: the sky figures provided by Mr. Connelly and his staff. I want somebody that does this for a living to give us an honest estimate of what it cost to retrofit this building so we can make an informed decision on whether or not that's a good way to go.\nSpeaker 0: You guys need to slow down. This is 200 and some million dollars. It's not petty cash. We just need more input. Go out to each one of your neighborhood organizations and make your case. Everybody I've talked to is just surprised at the speed that this is going, that nobody I don't even know what they're talking about.\nSpeaker 0: They've never come to my neighborhood. If it's in its deplorable condition, as you said, I know from a physical standpoint, you look at the outside. This place sucks because you have done nothing, nothing to improve the appearance of this building, because once you let it get in a deplorable state, it's much easier for you to justify its\nSpeaker 0: replacement, get a pressure, washer out cheese, clean the bird crap off the place, and then let's see what it really looks like. I swear, if this were, you know, if this were a resident's home, you guys would be on our cases immediately.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, this place, this looks like the biggest dump in the city.\nSpeaker 5: And it's purposely left that way. You know, you can joke about a lot of things, but $200 million is no joke.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Okay.\nSpeaker 11: Next speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to close the speaker's list. Last speaker. All right. Speaker was closed.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council Mike Call live in the eighth district. I've come.\nSpeaker 0: Tonight with.\nSpeaker 5: A big solution for you guys. No more bellyaching about not disclosing to the public what's going on here. Retrofits, so on and so forth. Anybody recall here when the port wanted to buy the World Trade Center and the price tag on that World Trade Center?\nSpeaker 5: Mr. West, you remember that. Why don't we just buy the World Trade Center? Partner up with a port, move it all down the street. Get this land and let a developer make something nice. Retain the rights to the land.\nSpeaker 5: Because, quite frankly, I'm getting pretty tired of our city selling and giving away our land. I don't see anything coming back from us, selling our land and giving it away. I don't see any money flowing into the general fund from it.\nSpeaker 5: I just see developers, consultants doing a real good job knocking Long Beach, and that's disappointing. I noticed there was a lot of people that spoke to this issue tonight that I've never really seen at the council before. Not that I've been coming down here a lot recently, but it's very, very energizing to see the younger people come\nSpeaker 5: out, they see what's going on and they have something to say about it. That's our next generation. That's the ones that's going to be living with whatever you guys decide to build tonight or going forward with one way or the other.\nSpeaker 5: They're not going to go away. They're going to remember this. They'll remember it like I remember when that council passed and let 150, 250 cracker boxes be built across the city that devastate it to this day. Same deal in my mind.\nSpeaker 5: Let's figure out what we're doing. Store it the best way we can. God bless the library people. And I think we need a library downtown, but we certainly don't need a city hall downtown. Why don't we put it out the airport?\nSpeaker 5: We got lots of land out there. This is the most some of the most valuable commercial land in the entire city are sitting on 12.\nSpeaker 0: 15 acres of land here.\nSpeaker 5: And you're going to build it another public entity building, and it's not going to.\nSpeaker 0: Pay any taxes. Come on, we can do better.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. We have gone back to the council and we have a motion. But Councilor Bishopsgate.\nSpeaker 9: Yes? I would just like to ask staff if we can make certain, because I don't see it on the floor as if you could post instructions at each floor for employees about in case of an earthquake. I know you've run through employees and you think everybody knows, but you know, it would be very helpful if that were\nSpeaker 9: publicly posted in a manner that all employees understood not to do certain things during. If we, in fact, have an earthquake in this building.\nSpeaker 4: A council membership scheme, we have regular earthquake drills in this building where we, in fact, simulate that there is an earthquake and evacuate the building and educate our employees that way. We're very cognizant of the safety issues and take every precaution and opportunity to educate our employees.\nSpeaker 9: Well, there's visitors who come here, too, so I would hope that we have some kind of posting of what they need to do.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. Before we go to a vote, actually, there's somebody up at the top there that maybe wanted to make a comment.\nSpeaker 9: That was.\nSpeaker 11: Queued up. Please go ahead.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening, Vice Mayor Garcia and city council members and the city. I am Francis Emily Dyson Harris and I reside in District one and I wholeheartedly support this matter to move forward at Sprout. I don't think that the difference in the time of waiting over the time is going to make that much of a difference.\nSpeaker 9: In fact, it might make a positive difference to enable in being able to move forward and not take so long to have the matter taken care of. And thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. We're gonna get a revote. There's another customer ship scheme that we're going to a vote.\nSpeaker 9: I want to make a substitute in motion. I obviously know I won't have a second here, but I'd like to make a substitute that we suspend the contract for our A pending the issuance and receivable of an RFP for retrofitting City Hall.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. Is there a second? No. Second, we're going to go to the motion on the floor. Members. NEWSCASTER votes. I mean, yes.\nSpeaker 6: This motion carries nine votes. Yes.\nSpeaker 11: Okay, Mr. Clark, next item.\n",

Council is required by law to conduct hearings on zoning map amendments and council actions are subject to court review in order to provide a record for court review.\nSpeaker 2: Testimony is recorded and any items presented to the Council are marked as exhibits and become a part of the public record. Speakers should begin their remarks by telling the council their names and city of residence and that they feel comfortable doing so.\nSpeaker 2: Their addresses. The public hearing for Council Bill 972 is open. May we have a staff report?\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam President. Good evening. I'm Kyle Dalton with the Department of Community Planning and Development. This is an application at 60 1600 leads Dale Drive to rezone from plan unit development number 584 in the former Chapter 59 Zoning Code to the new Denver Zoning Code Zone District of SCC three X is located in Council District six\nSpeaker 4: at the edge adjacent to Council District five in the Washington, Virginia, Vail statistical neighborhood. The property is located on the northwest corner of Leeds, Dale Drive and Exposition Avenue, directly across from George Washington High School and its approximately 40,200 square feet.\nSpeaker 4: It's currently vacant and the property owner is making the request to rezone his property to facilitate development. The property is currently in a planning unit development comprised of two parcels the subject parcel and the parcel immediately to the West, which has been developed as a mini storage site to rezone from a planning, a development to a new\nSpeaker 4: zoning code district requires the consent by all property owners and both property owners. Thus the owner of the subject site and the owner of the site to the West are on record consenting to this rezoning. And as a reminder, the approval of rezoning sets the rules that allow development in the use of a property but does not\nSpeaker 4: approve a specific development project property surrounding the planning to development zone. A variety of districts, as I mentioned, the planned unit development to the west, those high school across the street is zoned in a single unit district. The Eastside X Zone District properties to the southeast along Leeds Dell Drive are zoned CC three, which is a commercial\nSpeaker 4: corridor district and then to the south is a townhome suburban th2 point five all along the lead style corridor you'll see there are single unit zoning districts to the east and the west behind the corridor, but generally along the corridor for a half a mile in either direction.\nSpeaker 4: Our commercial corridor districts and business districts, there is also a mix of higher density residential immediately behind the commercial corridor, particularly on the west side to the south of the subject site. As I mentioned, the current uses vacant surrounding properties range from the high school to the many storage facility that was developed in the PD to the\nSpeaker 4: southeast alongside still our office and retail immediately adjacent and then to the south. Across exposition is a mix of multi-unit and single unit dwellings. This is a photo of the subject site, the vacant lot looking west from Leeds, Dale.\nSpeaker 4: And here are some other photos for context in terms of the building form and scale surrounding it. The mini storage property that was developed in the putty is a three storey building surrounded by surface parking. The middle photo shows to the south east, an example of the one storey commercial buildings found along Leeds Dell Drive with surface\nSpeaker 4: parking between the building in the street. The lower photo shows an example of the residential directly across exposition to the south. Generally 1 to 2 stories in height. The the application was originally received by CPD and notice of receipt of the complete application was sent to register neighborhood organizations in July of last year or July 3rd of\nSpeaker 4: 2014 after review and notification, and proceeded to a probably notice public hearing of the Planning Board in September of tune of 2014, at which the Planning Board recommended approval unanimously after hearing testimony, proceeded to the Neighborhoods and Planning Committee on October 15th.\nSpeaker 4: And there the committee voted by a vote of 6 to 1 to hold the to hold the application in committee with the applicant consent giving direction to the consent or to the applicant to change the application from PD to SCC three x.\nSpeaker 4: So it was originally planning a development in the new Denver Zoning Code and the committee directed the applicant and the applicant consented to go to a standard zoned district, the suburban commercial corridor, three zone district. So with that revised application, we provided a notice again to registered neighborhood organizations of a complete application for that to that zone\nSpeaker 4: district. On October 21st, 2014, they went back to Planning Board for their consideration of the New Zone District in November, where again the Planning Board recommended approval unanimously with one abstention. And then it went to Neighborhoods and Planning Committee again on November the 12th, and the committee this time moved it out unanimously.\nSpeaker 4: It was originally scheduled for a city council public hearing on December 15th, at which time the council voted unanimously to reschedule it to tonight. And today's the final public hearing for this application. The request is for three acts.\nSpeaker 4: So the this stands for the suburban neighborhood context, which is generally characterized by the city's commercial corridors and residential contexts, its winding streets, typically larger setbacks from the buildings to the street in both residential and commercial contexts. The C stands for Commercial Corridor, which is zoned district that allows a variety of mixed uses, including residential office, retail\nSpeaker 4: , eating and drinking establishments public and civic institutional uses. The three stands for the three storey height maximum, which is the lowest height available in a commercial corridor district in Denver. And then the X at the end stands for less intense uses than would otherwise be allowed in the SCC three.\nSpeaker 4: So the SCC three x as a useless that is designed to be more accommodating of transitions to residential neighborhoods by limiting or prohibiting rather certain uses that can be offensive in those areas such as pawnshops and the like.\nSpeaker 4: As compared to the proposed zoning, the current PUD is based on the old B one zone district, which was a district that allowed residential and then office. And that's essentially the extent of commercial. There is very limited retail uses that are listed on your screen.\nSpeaker 4: Anything beyond those very specific retail uses would not be allowed under the current podium. There's a maximum square footage of 19,200 square feet, a maximum height of two stories. And otherwise, it followed the former Chapter 59 zoning code.\nSpeaker 4: The new zoning, as compared to the old zoning, would expand the use list to allow retail uses and eating and drinking establishments, including drive thru facilities accessory to those uses. In the Denver zoning code, we regulate. We have a form based approach to the to the code.\nSpeaker 4: So we we regulate building form by height and setbacks and the like. So there is no maximum gross floor area. The maximum height would go to three stories and 45 feet, and all the other standards would follow the new code, the Denver zoning code, because there've been a lot of questions regarding the drive thru in particular, as\nSpeaker 4: you'll note in the comments in your packets, I've added here a slide identifying what the drive thru limitations are. If a drive thru was to to be to be developed on the property under the new zoning, these are limitations similar to what would be allowed in the former Chapter 59 if drive thrus were allowed.\nSpeaker 4: That provides some screening and separation regarding the location of the drive thru in relationship to the surrounding properties. It also requires that vehicle access to drive thrus, not unreasonably interfere with automobile or pedestrian traffic and that queuing must be able to be accommodated on site.\nSpeaker 4: All of these are standards in the Denver zoning code that apply to all suburban commercial corridor districts and would apply regardless of the specific development provided here. But we provide that for context, just so you're aware what the actual standard is in terms of the public outreach process for zoning, the following registered neighborhood organizations were notified at\nSpeaker 4: the time of application. We had four Virginia Vail Community Association, South Hilltop Neighborhood Association. Those two have commented on this application. And then there were two other neighborhood organizations who did not comment Inter Neighborhood Cooperation and Denver Neighborhood Association Incorporated after the time of application.\nSpeaker 4: We've as I mentioned earlier, this has been in the process for a long time. As you all know, we have our no registration period, which has just recently been. Completed in a new R.A. registered at the time. So though they didn't receive notice of the application, they did receive notice of tonight's public hearing.\nSpeaker 4: And that's the Virginia Vale Neighborhood Association in opposition to the request. We received comments from two neighborhood organizations, the Virginia Vail Community Association, which included a series of petitions in your packet opposing the application. And from the South Hilltop Neighborhood Association as well.\nSpeaker 4: There were 26 additional emails from 14 people opposing the application. Generally speaking, the comments are concerned with the possibility of negative impacts due to the addition of the drive thru that I mentioned, as well as retail and restaurant uses as compared to the current use allowances in support of the application, the applicant provided a petition that he\nSpeaker 4: had collected 40 signatures from surrounding residents just to address some of the comments that have been raised regarding this application. They kind of generally fall in one of eight categories. One one issue that's frequently raised as regards whether traffic will be increased on residential streets.\nSpeaker 4: We note CPD notes that traffic is not enforced in zoning, but the traffic code is enforced by the Denver Police Department, and Public Works will review an application at the time of development review for traffic impacts and any mitigation that might be required.\nSpeaker 4: There are concerns about the Access on Exposition Avenue. There's currently an already existing driveway from the mini storage site to Exposition Avenue, and this property has an easement that allows it to use that existing driveway access. Generally speaking, this is also not enforced in zoning and to the extent that access is reviewed, it is reviewed for fire\nSpeaker 4: and public works standards at the time of development review. Another concern has to do with students crossing. We still drive, which again is not addressed directly by zoning but is enforced by the Denver Police Department and then intersection.\nSpeaker 4: Congestion has also been raised and as I mentioned earlier, public works reviews, applications at the time of development, submittal for any required mitigation. And it's and it's designed that way because although the zoning will allow a variety of uses and a variety of heights, the traffic standards that are apply are specific to a development.\nSpeaker 4: So the scale, the size and the type of use may have different impacts on traffic. And so public works are views that at the time of that development is proposed. There are a number of other issues generally relating to external impacts that were also raised, which we review generally do not be enforced in zoning, include littering, noise\nSpeaker 4: and loitering. A couple of the things that are enforced in zoning that are subject of some of the comments include lighting. We do have outdoor lighting standards that would apply in the Denver zoning code if this gets approved tonight.\nSpeaker 4: And then the other has to do with late night hours of operation. The zoning code generally does speak to late night hours of operation. But in this case, because of the street that separates the site from a residential district, the rules that would occur would apply to an outdoor eating and drinking establishment likely would not apply.\nSpeaker 4: Indoor activities are not generally enforced in zoning. 24 hour diners and the like are allowed in Denver's zoning code. Of course, other regulations that affect hours of operation include licensing and other things outside of zoning. CBD review the application against the five review criteria that are in the Denver zoning code, and I'll review each of these one\nSpeaker 4: at a time. There's further detail about each of these in the staff report packets you were provided with last week. The first is that a rezoning application must be consistent with adopted plans, and there are two adopted plans that apply to this property.\nSpeaker 4: The first is the city's citywide comprehensive plan 2000. And then the second is Blueprint Denver, the city's land use and transportation plan adopted in 2002. There is no specific neighborhood plan for this area. Comprehensive Plan 2000 has a number of strategies that apply directly to this kind of a rezoning, including a desire to promote infill development at\nSpeaker 4: locations where infrastructure and services are already in place to reduce sprawl. The land use strategies include offering opportunities for increased density, more amenities and broadening the variety of compatible uses which the rezoning to the commercial corridor district would increase the variety of uses allowed.\nSpeaker 4: The mobility strategies include the promotion of mixed use development, which, as I mentioned, the new zone district would would allow a greater mix of uses. And then the economic activity goals relate to strengthening and where necessary, revitalize revitalizing Denver's commercial corridors.\nSpeaker 4: And this rezoning would allow for development along the commercial corridor at this vacant site. Turning to Blueprint Denver Blueprint Denver has a land use concept designation of the site of commercial corridor. That's the red color on the map.\nSpeaker 4: Commercial corridors are described in Blueprint Denver as being linear business districts that allow a variety of commercial uses oriented to an arterial street. It isn't an area of stability where the character is desired to be maintained while accommodating some new development and redefine.\nSpeaker 4: Element and blueprint Denver and Lead Sale Drive is designated as a commercial arterial street, generally lined with commercial uses. Exposition Avenue is an undesignated local street, and so a commercial corridor, the suburban commercial corridor 3xa district will implement blueprint Denver's recommendations.\nSpeaker 4: The commercial corridor aspect of the of the zoning is in direct alignment with the land use concept proposed in Blueprint Denver and and the stability and maintenance of character is maintained by choosing the three storey, the least intense commercial districts and specifically the three x, which has even less intense uses than our other commercial corridor districts in\nSpeaker 4: order to accommodate some new development. But being respectful of the character of the area. So having reviewed it for consistency with the adopted plans, we find the rezoning is consistent with both Plan 2000 and Blueprint Denver. We find also that the application, because it is to a standard zone district, has no impact on the uniformity of district\nSpeaker 4: regulations that apply to all properties in the suburban commercial corridor. Three ex district and to reason out of the old code and into the new code would further the public health, safety and welfare of the city. The justifying circumstance for this application is that the land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to such a\nSpeaker 4: degree that it's in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or to recognize the change character of the area. As noted in the staff report, there's been a variety of development and reinvestment along the Lido Corridor, including the mini storage site just to the west.\nSpeaker 4: Redevelopment of McDonald's just up the street from here, and a number of recent commercial tenant alteration and finish permits that have been issued along the corridor. In addition to general population growth in the central Denver region, as was pointed out, pointed out by the applicant in the application and documented by the census, which again are are all\nSpeaker 4: factors that lead to the understanding that other retail and neighborhood serving commercial uses would be desirable, would be useful in the area, and that recognizing those changes is appropriate. Finally, the fifth criterion is that the application must be consistent with the neighborhood context, the zoned district purpose and the intent, as this is a suburban neighborhood context.\nSpeaker 4: So that the suburban context is is is identified, as I mentioned, by the streets that are curved and where there's an incomplete grid, where property or buildings are set back from streets. And generally the SCC three exit zone district in particular applies to auto oriented arterial street corridors, where a building scale of 1 to 3 stories is\nSpeaker 4: desired with less intense uses than three. Here we find that the CC three zone district is a is a perfect fit for this. It's our lead style is an auto oriented arterial street. There is the desire for a lower building scale here than would otherwise be allowed.\nSpeaker 4: And the less intense uses again provide a good transition to the residential areas to the south and west. So having reviewed it against all five review criteria in the Denver zoning code, staff recommends approval.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. We have seven speakers signed up this evening. I'm going to read the first seven speakers when you hear your name, if you could make your way up to the bench here at the front so we can speed up the proceedings.\nSpeaker 2: The following are Paul Nafed Nafed, Phil, Mike Rudd, Holly Winter Hubbard, Bruce O'Donnell, Reuben Bread instead nial Smith, John Struts and Holly Struts. If you could make your way to the front.\nSpeaker 10: Honorable councilman and councilwoman of the Denver City Council. I want to thank you for the opportunity to present this development proposal to you.\nSpeaker 2: Could you tell us your name, please?\nSpeaker 10: Yes, my name is Paul Navratil and I live at 13 Tamari Drive in Littleton. First, I want to thank your Planning Department Representative Kyle Dalton for his presentation of the merits of this application. The zoning request is consistent with our plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and consistent with other commercial is own property to the east as well.\nSpeaker 10: It recognizes that this is an infill property on a commercial corridor. However, I'd like to focus on the efforts that we have made to meet with and work with the community associations and address their concerns. In late 2013, we had two meetings with Virginia Vail Community Association, Paula Szeto, and a group of people that came to that\nSpeaker 10: meeting. And that resulted in a letter of support dated March the second, 2014, which you have a copy of in your packet going down the road when we've got the planning board the first time, it was roughly late August.\nSpeaker 10: The property was posted. We had a call from Mr. Sturtz and he asked me to meet with him. I met with him and he had some questions which we talked about. And then he said he may have some other people that would like to meet with me and discuss questions and concerns.\nSpeaker 10: I said, Fine, I'd love to do that. And the next day I got an email from Mr. Sturtz. It said, No one wants to meet with you, Paul, going down the road. I heard. I listened and I heard the concerns about the cut through traffic, through the neighborhood and the association.\nSpeaker 10: Asked if the exit on the exposition could be closed and we at that their request, we went twice to the city planning department I'm sorry, the city transportation planning department and to the fire department one time was a concept plan review where they verbally said No.\nSpeaker 10: Those two access points must remain open for public safety. But we went in formally in writing in in December, and Mindy Decker concluded in an email to me or actually to Mike read, that the vehicular access on dance position should remain open to the use of the general public and not be restricted.\nSpeaker 10: I want to make sure that you get a copy of that because we specifically asked for that access to be cut closed off. The point is that no matter what's developed here, there's going to be two access points to that property.\nSpeaker 10: And that's the safety record.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Your time is up.\nSpeaker 10: My time is up.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you have six. Sorry, I just saw that. Please continue.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 10: So the neighborhood's position for several months has been no no change to the zoning. All you have is 584 in December. Councilman Brown and Bob Golic met with Jon Stewart's and policy, though, in attempt to broker an agreement.\nSpeaker 10: And as a result of that meeting, I agreed to make some concessions. Number one, no drive thru or drive up for fast food restaurant, no drive thru or drive up for any restaurant on site. So signage would be created to discourage traffic exiting onto exposition and encourage traffic on the leads.\nSpeaker 10: Deal and speed bumps on the property would be put on the property to slow traffic exiting to exposition. There was a handshake deal which in my understanding, the association reneged on two days later. January 20th, there was another meeting with Virginia Veal Association, Paula SIEGEL.\nSpeaker 10: And January 21st, I sent a letter to the association just reread, saying exactly what we would agreed to, and that I think you have a copy of as well. I asked you this before word to the association members, but I don't know what happened.\nSpeaker 10: I don't believe it was. At the conclusion of this meeting, Virginia Vale redefined their position. No change in the zoning. Leave it as a weed or maybe a city park. So after that we did some direct canvasing in February just to see what the neighbors thought.\nSpeaker 10: And in a couple or 3 hours on Saturday afternoon, we were able to get 40 people to sign our petition, and I'm sure you have copies of that. But I just want to just over the weekend, we received another letter of support, and I just want to give that to you.\nSpeaker 10: A couple of weeks ago, Councilman Brown asked me if I would be willing to mediate with the neighborhoods. I said yes. And after several discussions with Steve Charbonneau, he felt the concessions I was agreeing to were significant. There was a tentative mediation meeting set for last Friday, which on Sturtz, Steve Charbonneau canceled a meeting because he felt\nSpeaker 10: the neighborhood stance was, This is all you're going to get. We'd passed your existing zoning, no change. So he even as late as yesterday, Steve Charbonneau called me and asked me if I'd be willing to mediate and meet today at noon.\nSpeaker 10: And I said, yes, I think Jon Stewart said yes. And he reneged on that meeting this morning.\nSpeaker 2: You can conclude your comments. Your 6 minutes are up. Pardon me if you can conclude your comments. Your 6 minutes are up. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Well, I'd like to conclude. You know, the building is appropriate for the corridor city plans. It's going to be an attractive, modern building. It'll be with uses that are neighborhood retail uses and.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. The speaker is Mike Rudd.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. Oh.\nSpeaker 2: And Mr. Rudd, you have 3 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: This will be short. Okay. I'm at. I'm the architect resi office at 88 low in East Hampton Avenue in Denver. I've been working on this property, the site with Paul and several other real estate brokers for a number of years.\nSpeaker 8: We've had a large extended stay motel on this site that then transformed itself into an even bigger building in the self-storage facility.\nSpeaker 0: Most recently, we.\nSpeaker 8: Had a.\nSpeaker 0: 19,000 square foot office.\nSpeaker 8: Building on the site, and during that time we'd had various.\nSpeaker 0: Schemes for.\nSpeaker 8: One story small buildings, a couple of detached buildings from each other. And I think that all the brokers and the real estate people have.\nSpeaker 0: Answered questions for and did site plans for believe that this site is not an office site, that it is better suited as a.\nSpeaker 8: Good infill retail site? It's not significant in size. And so I would hope that council can see an approval for this.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Rudd. Our next speaker is Holly Winter Huppert. Huppert. You got it right. Good job. Hi. My name is Holly Winter, also known as Holly Huppert.\nSpeaker 1: I have many names for many different lives. Don't worry, I pay taxes under both names. I live at.\nSpeaker 2: 726 South Crime Area. I'm a homeowner there and I bought the house.\nSpeaker 1: Just about two.\nSpeaker 2: Years ago. And before I bought the house.\nSpeaker 1: I checked that empty lot and I checked the zoning because I don't want to live in a commercial quarter. Lead sells a couple of blocks away, but you know, it's a couple blocks away.\nSpeaker 2: I thought that was okay. And I checked the zoning very carefully and I saw eight.\nSpeaker 1: Years ago the same developer had changed the zoning. So I thought.\nSpeaker 2: I'm safe because I don't want to live in a commercial district. This proposed project is less than 100 feet from where I.\nSpeaker 1: Parked my car in front of my house. That's close.\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to live in a commercial commercial zone. I hope you understand that.\nSpeaker 1: I don't think you would either. The children play in the street. It's it's a neighborhood. It's not a commercial place. It's really important to me that I have a house that is quiet and safe. There is a.\nSpeaker 2: Lot of traffic already that comes through onto our street.\nSpeaker 1: From the storage.\nSpeaker 2: Unit that was put up a few years ago. I count one car every 2 minutes during rush hour.\nSpeaker 1: So we keep all the children inside during that time. With more development on this property, it's going to be.\nSpeaker 2: Unsafe for our children. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Our next speaker is Bruce O'Donnell.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, Madam Chair, and members of the Council. My name is Bruce O'Donnell. I reside in Denver, Colorado. My office address is 800 Glenarm Place, Suite 200. I'm here tonight to speak in favor of this rezoning application and to encourage your support of it is.\nSpeaker 0: The staff report has pointed out it's consistent with the adopted plans, primarily comp plan 2000 and blueprint Denver. And it's also been demonstrated that it has consistency with the neighborhood context, description and also the zone district purposes blueprint.\nSpeaker 0: Denver came up with a term when it was put into place in that term as commercial corridors, which I think is a key ingredient of tonight's discussion, because that then in turn informed our new zoning code. When we rezoning the entire city, we came up with a commercial corridor districts.\nSpeaker 0: This application is for our C, C, three X, which is the suburban context commercial corridor. And as has been pointed out tonight by staff, lead steel is identified as a commercial arterial and so it's on a scale and similar and would expect land use patterns.\nSpeaker 11: Similar to.\nSpeaker 3: Colfax.\nSpeaker 0: And Carter Boulevard, for example, which also both happen to be state highways, just like lead sales of state highway. They have limited access. The applicant pointed out that during his pre application conferences that he explored and wanted to see if he could limit access on exposition in the fire department required two points of access in and that\nSpeaker 0: links into the state highway issues. So this is very much a commercial corridor. It's also important to note that the applicant, I think, took the high road and attempted on numerous occasions to engage the neighbors in a transparent and sincere process, including agreeing to mediation multiple times and was stonewalled at every turn.\nSpeaker 0: So I think a good process has been conducted and this was also the appropriate zoning and the appropriate land use for a location like this. So the other thing that I think is important to think about in the staff report touched on this briefly.\nSpeaker 0: The proposed land use here is consistent with land uses nearby, right up and down this corridor. So, for example, neighbors of this property.\nSpeaker 3: Include.\nSpeaker 0: A freestanding Starbucks with drive thru, a McDonald's with drive thru, a car wash and a car dealership. All auto intensive use appropriate for a commercial corridor. So consistent with the staff report in the unanimous approval of the planning board.\nSpeaker 0: I'm testifying tonight in hopes that you will approve Ordinance 972.\nSpeaker 3: Rezoning the subject property to SCC.\nSpeaker 0: Three x. It's an implementation step for Blueprint Denver and it also eliminates another remaining.\nSpeaker 11: Artifact from the Chapter 59.\nSpeaker 0: Zoning Code. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. That was perfect. 3 minutes. Reuben Bread instead, please.\nSpeaker 0: Well, good evening. I'm Robin Gibb instead. 393 South A.V. St Denver, Colorado And I somewhat understand the position you're in, having been in similar in my own life. Great. Public trust is in your hands. Now there can be a lot of rules and regulations.\nSpeaker 0: Some good, some of them good, sometimes some of them good. Not good. Other times I also am president of the Homeowner Association South Hilltop Neighborhood, and I'm proud to be in that position and and took it because the people I talked to in my neighborhood felt that they couldn't talk to the city, felt that they were ignored\nSpeaker 0: all the time. Felt frustrated with that time. The current person. And I think we can empathize with that. Least I hope you can empathize because sympathy is not what we're asking for, is empathy. If you lived in this neighborhood immediately behind this proposal.\nSpeaker 0: You see that there is a public street? Oh, commercial corridor is on the other side. Lee still. The residents that are most affected immediately are behind it, behind exposition. Most of the petitioners against it live in that immediate area.\nSpeaker 0: And it's. Not a matter of how many signatures? 700 some homes. Most of them in the this side of the corridor don't live anywhere near the proposed project. Out of sight, out of mind. We've all heard that expression.\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'm here because I care. I care for South Hates Hilltop. We're affected by late. Still the school. We're affected by the density. We join with our neighbors in good faith. Hoping that you as persons. Elected to represent the best interests of the people.\nSpeaker 0: We'll look at those who live within a hundred feet. Less than 100 feet. A couple hundred feet. See the traffic problems that are going to going to be there. But he says they're going to be there. Increased traffic in neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 0: I appeal to you to consider the goodwill of the people that are most affected. In this matter and turn down the change in zoning. Eight years ago it was approved by the same developer that this is what it's going to be.\nSpeaker 0: Well, now we see that was an untrustworthy statement and adventure by the developer. Thank you for your kindness and I pray for your hearts to be right because right is always right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir. Our next speaker is Niall Smith, followed by John Struts and Holly Struts.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. My name is Niall Smith, South Korea area, Denver, Colorado. I'd like to thank you for your time. First of all, Councilman Brown, I'd like to thank you for being at that police rally on Saturday. I noticed that you were one of the few from the council that was there.\nSpeaker 0: I would like to simply say that this rezoning. Had happened eight years ago prior to me purchasing my property on South Camarillo, and that the developer, to reiterate, made a promise to keep it at that. So simply a matter of maintaining a paid 584 versus an SCC three x would be something that would be beneficial for the\nSpeaker 0: neighborhood, the infill, the density, the amount of traffic being diverted down our city streets on an ongoing basis, the possibility of a drive through with lighting and traffic until at least midnight, I would think for a drive thru restaurant would be something that would be an annoyance to at least four or five streets within that area.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you very much for your consideration and thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Mr. John Struts about 6 minutes.\nSpeaker 3: Hello. My name is John Sturtz. I live at 710 South Korean Street. I'm considered the person who's riled everyone up over the change in the zoning request. I want to mention that City Council is not required to. Approve of every rezoning request that comes in front of them.\nSpeaker 3: We ask the applicant to keep the zoning approved. 584 Because the agreement was made with the same gentleman, the same applicant eight years ago when it was formally. Designated as an hour to zone. And we conceded to APD 584, which would be less intensive, uses commercial type things.\nSpeaker 3: We keep intermixing the two words in commercial and retail, but what the SCC three X would involve would be more retail and more traffic. In fact, the applicant did say that a traffic study that was conducted, he didn't indicate by whom, but a traffic study that was conducted indicated that one car per minute extra would be entering\nSpeaker 3: the property that would be entering the property at some point. I'm sure that car would exit the property. The trouble with this particular site is that most of the entry will more than likely be on in excuse me, from the stale drive on to the property at 6200 East Fleet.\nSpeaker 3: Still the exit back out on to lead stale would be near impossible. Almost everything on those along that corridor, which is State Highway 83, almost every one of the new properties that have been developed have a no left turn sign, which would essentially limit who can exit from the from the lead stale side.\nSpeaker 3: So we're making the assumption I realize it's an assumption, but it's a logical one. And we're asking for just a little common sense in terms of looking at the site and looking at how are people going to exit back out onto lead steel.\nSpeaker 3: There is a curb cut that's just going on to the cube smart part of the property. The applicant has asked that that easement be granted for his use. Also, in addition to Cube Smart and Cube Smart has signed off on that.\nSpeaker 3: The trouble is there are accidents. There have been for within just the last two weeks on lead steel right in front of Cube Smart, as well as a hit and run behind Cube Smart two weeks ago. This is all documented in every block Internet site.\nSpeaker 3: The different accidents that have taken place. There were some major injuries just last week. I don't know how many people were actually hurt, but two ambulances and four police cars were out on lead. Still at the evening rush hour time lead still is an extremely busy street.\nSpeaker 3: If any of you have driven down that street. The high school students during the school year have open campus at lunch hour. They migrate throughout the neighborhood. And once again, common sense. We don't have any studies that indicate that the high school students won't use the walk don't walk signs, but it's typically the case that they will\nSpeaker 3: take the shortest route if there is a attractive nuisance across the street, which we would consider a fast food restaurant. We're talking about fatalities, injuries, whatever. And I realize the zoning is saying we don't look at traffic. Traffic isn't our concern.\nSpeaker 3: The police will take care of that. And we're supposed to wait until after the fact that this is built to address the issues of injuries and troubles with traffic on that location with just the one curb cut alone.\nSpeaker 3: There are some problems with exiting. As I mentioned, there's a deceleration, if that's the proper word, lane, going into that curb, cut on leads still. But if someone were to take a right turn back out on to lead steel, there's no acceleration lane so there'd be quite some time involved in getting back out on to lead steel\nSpeaker 3: and once again common sense indicates they will exit onto exposition the drivers and by going down exposition they will cut through the neighborhood as they already do in order to shorten the route during rush hour. Oftentimes, cars are backed up all the way from Monaco to Holly Street at rush hour.\nSpeaker 3: The difficulty with that, once again, is safety. It's a Colorado State Highway 83. We cannot handle the noise, the loitering, the lighting, the hours of operation. We agreed to a 55, 84, and we're asking the applicant to please stick with what he agreed to and honor the commitment and our agreement with him eight years ago.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Our next speaker is Holly Sturtz.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Holly Brooks. I am at 710 South Graham Area Street. I also own property at 7765 South Court Maria Street. Our neighborhood association has pleaded with zoning to maintain the current plywood, which was hammered out over a year's worth of meetings with the current applicant.\nSpeaker 1: When this applicant appeared before you the first time, you sent him back to zoning for an ever even broader usage designation. Our overwhelming concern, which we voted 92 five in our neighborhood, about the serious consequences of permitting a high traffic development on this site.\nSpeaker 1: There is a curb cut entering the property, but traffic is dangerously congested at most times of the day, so that the only obvious exit is the one established onto exposition and into our residential neighborhood. Even now, with only the quiet, low traffic business located at this site, frustrated drivers get backed up on this highway and cut through\nSpeaker 1: . Earlier this very month, there was a hit and run accident at this same egress onto exposition. After hitting a young pedestrian, the driver sped off down my street. The addition of the high traffic business, which the applicant proposes, would increase this threat exponentially.\nSpeaker 1: It is probably your inclination to approve this plan and pass responsibility on to court or traffic. We've been warned by other unsuccessful neighborhood groups not to pin our hopes on traffic. Even if they are to rubber stamp this rezoning.\nSpeaker 1: They will fail to appreciate the dangers that a fast food restaurant located directly across from George Washington High School will pose to a man, the vice president of G.W., the school cop and the local officer at the scene of that hit and run had one response to the proposed plan a disaster.\nSpeaker 1: The applicant has claimed that we have rejected his offers to append concessions to this zoning. You know as well as we do that all promises appended to SC c3x are empty and unenforceable. Please reconsider this rezoning. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. That concludes our speakers question for members of council. Councilwoman Robb.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Madam President. I just want to be sure. I think my first couple of questions are for Kyle. I want to be sure that I understand the changes in the sort of history on this site. I thought you had said that before eight years ago or before you d 584 the site was B1.\nSpeaker 7: Is that right? Because I heard someone say ah two in the testimony.\nSpeaker 4: That, you know, the, the current PWD is based on B1.\nSpeaker 1: Oh for.\nSpeaker 4: You two it was.\nSpeaker 7: It was are two different are two.\nSpeaker 6: Right.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, I think so.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. And okay. And that's why there weren't drive thrus in the others because b one didn't have to. I do understand that. Right. And then a second question. If you look at the site where the storage facility is, whatever you think of storage facilities, at least there's a detached sidewalk in green grass and it's landscaped.\nSpeaker 7: Looks pretty nice. Did the PWD require that detached sidewalk? I know we get right away and zoning, you know the sort of never the twain shall meet. But if this site were to be redeveloped, I'd like to see similar landscaping.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. I don't recall those being specific provisions of the PD. I'm sure they must have been the public works right away standards when the property was developed.\nSpeaker 7: So do you think we can assume similar standards would be applied?\nSpeaker 4: I mean, that would be the public work standard on a street like this. You know, I know those are always subject to variances, but.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 7: And then let's see. I think I had another one. I guess my questions for Mr. Neff tell. But as you're coming up. So just a couple questions I didn't understand. Were you the applicant in owner for 85, 84?\nSpeaker 10: No. The the applicant and owner at the time was Channel six Television PBS's.\nSpeaker 7: When it was risen to 584. But did you buy it from PBS?\nSpeaker 8: We did.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. And then my other question was, can you go back over what you and Bob Golic talked about with Councilman Brown and offered to the neighborhood?\nSpeaker 10: Yes, I'd like to do that. And in reference to that. I have some notes that I'd like to give you, but basically. I mean, basically, the the I guess the tentative agreement was that we would not use the drive thru lane for fast food restaurants, nor would we use it for any restaurants.\nSpeaker 10: We would develop site signage to take the traffic back on to Leeds Dale instead of onto exposition. And in fact we, we agreed that we would put speed bumps on at that exposition, which would slow down that cut through traffic.\nSpeaker 7: So this is a hard question because I realize you don't have any agreements at this point with the neighborhood for various reasons. But is that would that still be your intention in developing the site to put the speed bumps in and not have a drive through for a fast food restaurant and to have the exit signs?\nSpeaker 10: Well, you know, we've we've tried and tried and tried to negotiate with the association and we've met with. No. All you get is page five.\nSpeaker 7: Though, with no agreement with the association, you don't feel bound to those conditions that you just stated.\nSpeaker 10: No, I.\nSpeaker 7: Don't. Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Yeah. And I know I didn't make my point before, but I am respectfully requesting approval of this application. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. For my colleagues, some of you are able to see your names on the screens and some of you aren't. So here's what I have in front of me. I have Councilman Ortega, Councilman Kennish, Councilman Brown and Councilwoman Sussman.\nSpeaker 2: So, Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Kyle, I don't see you. Would you mind coming up to the microphone, please? I've been perusing through the documents here, and I didn't see anything from G.W. High School. Is there anything in the record from the high school?\nSpeaker 4: So we we sent the referral of the both the initial application and the revised application to Denver Public Schools. And then we were copied on some correspondence with them. So we sent another email to them to invite them to comment.\nSpeaker 4: So they received three different requests for comment and never provided comment directly to the city on this matter.\nSpeaker 2: So we don't have anything in the record? That's correct. Okay. I would like to ask someone, how about Mr. Newfield, if you wouldn't mind, coming forward? Sorry. That's okay. I'll try to speak up. So can you. Can you tell us what you are planning to put on the site?\nSpeaker 10: Yes, absolutely.\nSpeaker 5: This should be. Can you talk to the microphone?\nSpeaker 10: This is the current plan we're working with and, you know, trying to say like this is very difficult because it's inefficient compared to a rectangular site. But we're planning to develop a single storey building. Roughly half of the density that's currently allowed on the property.\nSpeaker 10: And it'll be a like what I would call a neighborhood retail service building that would have such things as maybe a sandwich shop, a hair salon, tanning salon, maybe a dry cleaner, sit down restaurant, those kinds of uses that would service the neighborhood and.\nSpeaker 10: These are the two access points, details of which position.\nSpeaker 3: We're going to have speed bumps here.\nSpeaker 5: To slow down the heavy duty trucks. The transfer traffic is already happening.\nSpeaker 10: Because the people that cut through there, if this is backed up, are in fact in fact, they're headed over toward Monaco. And our plan is actually going to slow that down because of the speed bumps that that cut through traffic is going to happen no matter what.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I'd like to ask a question about parking. What what are the parking requirements for what you're proposing? How many parking spaces are you required to have?\nSpeaker 10: Well, this plan here shows an approximately 9000 square foot building. I, I believe the parking ratio is about one four, 200 square feet. And that would be enough to allow for maybe one or two restaurants a pizza place.\nSpeaker 10: And then these other services, general services, because the parking ratio for general retail is a lot less than it is for a restaurant. So we have plenty of parking to service that need.\nSpeaker 2: So I want to ask now about the traffic study that was done. Did the traffic study take into account the fact that there's a high school across the street? And I heard somebody speak to the fact that it has an open campus and there's concern about pedestrian safety of students crossing the street to to maybe buy their\nSpeaker 2: lunch at the restaurants that you just talked about.\nSpeaker 10: Yes. Okay. Thank you. That's several questions, but I'll try to.\nSpeaker 2: If you can, speak into the microphone, if you're going to use that.\nSpeaker 10: It was clear that several questions, but I try to address them. This plan here shows George Washington High School. Can you all see this? George Washington High School in relation to the site, the city has provided a crosswalk and a light at this intersection and at the other end of the storage building where the power pools are\nSpeaker 10: . So there's two ways for people to get across the street there safely. The other question I think you asked about was the trucks.\nSpeaker 2: So those are not there today or are they proposed as part of the development.\nSpeaker 10: Of those two lights and crosswalks are there today?\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 10: The other I think you asked another question about traffic and getting back on to leads.\nSpeaker 2: Nailed it. I was asking if the traffic study took into account the pedestrian safety and the potential volume of students that might be crossing the street to patronize any of the restaurants.\nSpeaker 10: I don't believe it takes into that account. That into account. But we we haven't been requested do a traffic study by the development services. And if we are requested, we will do one. But I asked a traffic engineer to give me a rough estimate, and this is what he said, that he said the proposed near 9000 square\nSpeaker 10: foot development will generate foreign trips per day. When added to the many storage trips, the total site will generate 650 trips per day or 230 less trips than reported in the March 2000. Please still comments. Traffic Impact Study Specialty Retail Center includes a variety of uses such as restaurants, florists, real estate offices, etc. So I feel this\nSpeaker 10: is appropriate for your project to do that. Answer your question.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it did. And I have one last question, if I may, Madam President. I know others have questions. My last question is about it's along the lines of what Councilwoman Robb had asked you earlier in terms of the concessions that you indicated you all were willing to agree to.\nSpeaker 2: But I heard your answer to her question when she asked if that's something you are, in fact going to adhere to, even though there was not a clear agreement with the neighborhoods. And so my question is about the hours of operation.\nSpeaker 2: If there is a drive up window, I heard you say that there would be no drive thru as actually it's in the document you just passed out, no drive thru or drive ups for fast food restaurants, no drive thru or drive ups for any restaurants.\nSpeaker 2: And so. Is that, in fact, what you're committing to as part of this application tonight?\nSpeaker 10: You know, I've I've been trying in good faith to work something out with the associations. And I think you can see from what I said before that I basically been rejected. There was no effort made on their part to conclude mediation, which we even tried to do today.\nSpeaker 10: If if the notes from the came from that meeting with Charlie Brown, Mr. Counselor Brown and Bob Golic basically said that I would agree to these things, provided that the neighborhood would support the application and not commence any legal issues afterward.\nSpeaker 10: So it was a give and take type situation and I feel like I'm giving and they're taking. But when there's, you know, when there's no common agreement, where can you go?\nSpeaker 2: So in terms of the issue of hours, of operation, of a drive thru, is that something that was ever discussed?\nSpeaker 10: It's never been discussed. And I would just whatever the city code is, I don't know, but we would comply with that.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I have no further questions at this time. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilwoman Kennish.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Madam President. Most of my questions were asked, but let's just close the loop on this one from Councilman Ortega Childs. You know the answer to the question, what are the hours of operation for? Generally for commercial and specifically for drive thru in this zone district.\nSpeaker 4: There's no requirement generally for commercial on hours of operation. I believe the record there is a requirement of hours of operation for an outdoor eating and serving area. So if they had an outdoor patio relevant to a restaurant, if it's within 50 feet of the residential zone district.\nSpeaker 4: So if they put it on the front side of the facing leads, they would probably be too far to be even subject to those. But there are limits on those hours of operation that I believe are I believe it's it's 10:00 Sunday through Thursday and 11:00 Friday and Saturday when they would have to close for an outdoor\nSpeaker 4: eating and serving area if it's close enough to the residential district.\nSpeaker 1: And how about for a drive thru?\nSpeaker 4: And I don't believe their hours of operation for a drive thru.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. No further questions, Madam President.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Counsel. McKinney. Councilman Brown.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Madam President. All ask more questions, please. Would you mind repeating the list? Possible tenants that you just mentioned a moment ago and do so very slowly. I think you've started with the what you threw out a potpourri of tenants and I think three or four or five.\nSpeaker 8: Could you list those again, please? I'm going to write these down.\nSpeaker 10: Yes. The kinds of uses we envision would be a hair salon, maybe a Supercuts tanning salon, perhaps a dry cleaning operation, maybe a sandwich shop. Sit down restaurant. Maybe a pizza place. A flower shop. You know, those general kinds of retail type uses?\nSpeaker 10: Restaurant.\nSpeaker 8: Wow. That's quite a variety and help build. How large would the building be that you say 9000 square feet approximately.\nSpeaker 10: It's very hard to get efficiency on a property right. Like this with.\nSpeaker 8: Well, you're going to start building without any tenants or are you going to build to a specific tenant? What are your plans if this is approved?\nSpeaker 10: No. And we only envision maybe five or six businesses in the building. We don't see all those.\nSpeaker 8: You so you can't, you know, have enough room.\nSpeaker 10: Yeah. And I've, I've I'm working with a company called Waldoboro Scott who are talking to prospective users. And of course, we won't start construction until we have significant pre-leasing. No, that would be a requirement of financing.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. And like to get Kyle up here again because in the testimony, it seems like. That you the applicant. Was criticized for changing this from a PWD to more standard zoning. Would you explain what happened when it went to committee?\nSpeaker 8: It went to committee last year as a p u d, right?\nSpeaker 4: That's correct. A Denver zoning code.\nSpeaker 8: Right.\nSpeaker 4: And then and then the neighbors in planning committee expressed concern with it being a customized zoning and didn't think it met. The criteria for planning and development. Invited the applicant to come to the table and consider a standard zoned district and the applicant consented.\nSpeaker 4: So then the committee voted to direct the applicant to revise their application.\nSpeaker 8: So it was really it was my friends and colleagues on the committee that changed.\nSpeaker 4: I should note the committee did advise the applicant in our pre-application meeting at the very beginning that we would recommend a standard zoned district. But we also were recommending approval of the PD at the time it was found that met our criteria.\nSpeaker 4: So.\nSpeaker 8: I mean, there are a lot of fingers to be pointing here, but certainly the council had a role and that's why it went back.\nSpeaker 4: Right. With the applicant's consent. Yeah.\nSpeaker 8: And maybe someone, one of my colleagues, any of them might want to address that. The head of the committee might be helpful in doing that and I relinquish my time for others. I do have other questions, though.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Brown. Councilwoman Sussman.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Brown, for the intro there. Yes, but it did come to us as a paddock cow. I do have some questions for you. And when we ask and generally, we're trying to move to the new zoning and try not to reconstruct pads from the older zoning.\nSpeaker 1: And when we asked what the reason for requesting a pad was, it was because the applicant wanted to make a less intense development there. Was that the reason why? And so we asked, wasn't there a way to move it into the new zoning and keep it less intense?\nSpeaker 1: Do I have that right?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, that's generally correct.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So we hit two birds with one stone. We maintain less intensity in the development and we're able to move it into the new zoning now by less intense. The original pod would have allowed what? That is more intense than what they have now.\nSpeaker 4: Then what they have now under the current PD, I don't know that I would characterize anything less intense.\nSpeaker 1: And the couple had said it was less intense. The ex made it makes it less intense and less intense.\nSpeaker 4: Than the SCC three without the ex which zone other zoning zoning found elsewhere along this corridor.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Most of the zoning is three SCC or 83.\nSpeaker 4: In some cases it's urban edge SCC three.\nSpeaker 1: So that in the ex reduces what opportunities.\nSpeaker 4: So it prohibits some uses that would otherwise be allowed. So it's entirely on the use list. Generally prohibits pawnshops, firearms sales, those types of things.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, there's that. Okay. So it's not less, but it is one story building instead of what could be three. Right. Or the proposed building is.\nSpeaker 4: I believe the applicant said that they're proposing a one storey building. The zoning would allow a three storey building.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The other question that I have had was. One of the folks who talked to talked about their concern on trying to get on to lead stale, which if anybody lives there they know that's is a challenge although they do have turn lanes was there was the original pod.\nSpeaker 1: Would it have allowed an office building? And this new zoning allows some retail, right?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, that's.\nSpeaker 1: Correct. Would the office the drivers to the office building have had a different kind of access and egress issues to light still than a retail customer?\nSpeaker 4: Would the Pudi District site blend in, contemplate different driveways, if that's what you're asking. I mean, the physical access is in the same location as it currently.\nSpeaker 1: Is, right? So no matter who's driving there, they're going to have the difficulty of accessing on to it's not because it's retail that it makes it more difficult to get on and off a lead still, is it?\nSpeaker 4: No, I think I think the comments generally are concerned with differences of volume and generation, that sort of thing. Of course, that's dependent on the square footage, the kind of, you know, restaurant that goes we all know, you know, the what's the what's the the drive thru chain in California, you know, that has the drive thrus around\nSpeaker 4: the block. And then a Starbucks has peaks in the morning, but a pizza restaurant has peaks in the at dinner time. So it kind of depends on the nature of the use and and the size of the use, what the volumes would be.\nSpeaker 4: But in terms of the physical access and needing to get on the lead, still exposition, that doesn't change.\nSpeaker 1: That isn't changed by the new zoning. Okay. Thank you. I'd like to ask Mr. Neff, tell some questions. So in your conversations with Bob Golic and others and what the neighborhood had asked for, I did hear many neighbors speak about their concern about a drive up restaurant.\nSpeaker 1: But I see that you had started negotiating and the in this list and I know people have talked about it, but I want to make sure that we're clear about this. You had agreed to have no drive thru or drive ups for fast food restaurant routes and in fact no drive thru a drive ups for any restaurants\nSpeaker 1: signage on the site to discourage traffic exiting to exposition and speed bumps installed. Now, as you say, the neighborhood didn't want to negotiate further, but could if they had negotiated, would you have would you have written these down into part of the agreement so that it could have remained with the change in the zoning?\nSpeaker 10: Yes, I would.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It's moot now because the arrangements didn't occur. Right. I just wanted to know if you had been willing, because I saw that Mr. Golic had suggested that you actually write these down so that neighbors can feel a little more secure about the arrangements that would have been made.\nSpeaker 10: Well, and it was my understanding that an agreement would be put together that everybody could sign and then become legally enforceable documents.\nSpeaker 1: But when you approached the neighborhoods, was it the the neighborhoods? They did not want to sign it?\nSpeaker 10: Well, at the meeting with Councilwoman Brown, Bob Golic, John Sturtz and policy, though, my understanding was that these things were discussed and the handshake agreement was made and two days later, the association withdrew from that agreement and. I see.\nSpeaker 10: That's where.\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to make sure I understood.\nSpeaker 10: Incidentally, and I didn't answer this one quite correctly, but I would agree to limiting the use of the drive through to midnight, because I know I recognize that that's very important to the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: I see. Okay. Thank you very much for the questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Kelly.\nSpeaker 0: I was at that meeting.\nSpeaker 2: The public testimony is completed, so if you can have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next council member is Councilwoman Robb.\nSpeaker 7: Madam President, I do have a question, but I'd like to yield to Councilman Brown, because I think we're going on this point.\nSpeaker 8: Yes. Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. May I? Madam President, thank you. All right. Let's have the other side, if you will. Paul, do you want to come up arming and you guys want to come up and talk about what happened?\nSpeaker 8: Mr. Smith. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you for allowing.\nSpeaker 8: You bet. And we were both in the meeting. Both of you were in the meeting. I was there. And the late Bob Golic was there. Who was another neighborhood representative, I believe was their.\nSpeaker 3: Policy, though? Yes, Mr. Hall.\nSpeaker 8: Was there. It's not here. Okay, he's not here. Okay. Various. Oh, hey, Paul. How are you? You're absolutely right. There was no handshake after our meeting. But I do believe on that Thursday when we met for nearly 2 hours in my office.\nSpeaker 8: I was trying to act like a facilitator and bring the parties together, and I requested that Mr. GARLICK contact his client and get his client to agree to no drive thrus. Because I understand that in the public hearing at the planning board that was the number one issue that really drove the opposition.\nSpeaker 8: I thought we had made an agreement. We hadn't made progress. And then I get another email through the next day saying that it was rushed and we never got to the curb cut issue that you want. I'd like to hear your response to that, please.\nSpeaker 3: Just part of the difficulty with that, as you know, was that the the meeting that was supposed to follow the agreement was, I believe, three days afterward. I think we met on the 12th and then the next meeting was the 15th of December.\nSpeaker 3: And part of that stipulation, beyond what Mr. Gorelick recommended and nothing legally was written up that would be binding, we needed to talk about whether it would be tied to the deed. And so if the property ownership changed, it wouldn't affect us in any different way.\nSpeaker 3: We discussed that, and Mr. Golic essentially wrote up just a memo that we did make some we made some progress. And he would like to consider that. But he did some some other aspects of the memo included the fact that I was supposed to go around the entire neighborhood and get all of those 42 signature signatures on\nSpeaker 3: the list to agree to withdraw any opposition to the the agreement that was tentative. I said that I couldn't do that in three days, and that was my major opposition and the reason for the postponement at that time.\nSpeaker 3: Once again, there were no legal documents written up. And as Nigel said, there wasn't a handshake. I think you were met. I think you remember that we had to cut the meeting short because you got an emergency call and and you acted properly in terms of it being a quasi judicial, you didn't have any input into it\nSpeaker 3: . So it was essentially you gave us the opportunity to talk in your office, which was great.\nSpeaker 8: Now, do you want to like would you like to add anything? I would just.\nSpeaker 0: Like to say that none of the agreements that were possibly made were legally binding. So this gave Mr. Naftali the opportunity to renege on any agreements that were verbal due to the fact that we would have to go and have another fight afterwards if he decided.\nSpeaker 8: To change his process. I'm moving on to the next attempt, if you will, to mediate this dispute. And that's when I contacted Community Mediation Concepts and my colleagues have a copy of the letter. What happened, why? I have you, Steve Charbonneau, for my 14 years on city council.\nSpeaker 8: And guess what? He's always succeeded in bringing hostile parties together. I can think of one incident where there was a a table between the two parties. One was on one side of the table and the other was on the other.\nSpeaker 8: And it was the table represented, in my judgment, the DMZ. It was that hostile. What happened? Why could you not would not give up anything in this negotiations? And that's according to what Steve Charbonneau said.\nSpeaker 3: One of the difficulties with all of the mediation that was conducted was via email. There was no personal face to face meeting and once again, nothing was written up. And essentially the memo that Mr. Golic wrote had totally gotten out of the argument altogether.\nSpeaker 3: And all that was being offered to us were speed bumps and perhaps a larger culvert for the water drainage from the property would maybe discourage traffic. But that once again was tentative and there wasn't anything legally written up.\nSpeaker 3: But once again, all the all the other agreements that Bob Golic wanted to talk about further were completely dropped as far as drive through and when it came to mediation. One thing that hasn't been mentioned at all is that this easement belongs to Cube Smart.\nSpeaker 3: So if you look at the memo closely, it says that the speed bumps would be put in with the approval of Cube Smart. According to the past president of the VCA, Deb Ward. Speed bumps were proposed when we had this same argument eight years ago about traffic and about high intensity, and we were told the speed bumps\nSpeaker 3: wouldn't do anything or they wouldn't be allowed because the fire department didn't want them. But once again, the the essence of this is that we were being offered speed bumps if Cube Smart approved. The second thing was signage to discourage through traffic.\nSpeaker 3: I don't know how many people really have noticed that. That the signage doesn't necessarily make any difference in terms of the the shortest distance between two points in the avoidance of of traffic jams.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, John. Thank you. Thank you. Madam President.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Brown, are there other questions from members of council? Councilwoman Kathryn Roberts.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, I just want to go back. I mean, ordinarily in Councilwoman Sussman tried to address this. Tonight we're deciding between the current zoning, in a sense, putting 584 in a new proposed zoning. It gets a little muddled because in between there was a PUD proposed.\nSpeaker 7: That sounds like it might have been preferable to the neighborhood. That was not the total impression I got in committee. So, Kyle, I want to ask you something else about that. In the party that came to committee. It was my recollection that a drive thru was also a use.\nSpeaker 7: Is that correct?\nSpeaker 4: That's correct.\nSpeaker 7: And there was other retail in that as well. What was missing and what was missing from it? It seems to me that it cut down on height the little bit, which from the three stories to one, that was sort of the distinction I heard when I thought, you know, there's not that much in it for the neighborhood\nSpeaker 7: that we shouldn't go to the street zoning. Would that be an accurate recollection?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, that's I could I can provide more detail. Kelly, can.\nSpeaker 6: Can I get the.\nSpeaker 11: PowerPoint back up?\nSpeaker 4: So I have a slide here that compares what that pre application was as compared to the SCC three x. It is correct that when the party was at planning board it had the same opposition at Planning Board and there was written testimony, a written correspondence also opposing it.\nSpeaker 4: The differences as compared to the three X were in a number of uses and the height. So yes that it it was going to.\nSpeaker 7: Prohibit maybe.\nSpeaker 4: Some uses and the lower the height.\nSpeaker 7: Probably even the liquor store because it's so close to George Washington. And that's debatable, right?\nSpeaker 4: Well, you know, liquor stores.\nSpeaker 8: You know, it could it could.\nSpeaker 4: There's that the rule now that can be waved.\nSpeaker 7: Back. Okay. All right. That that helps me just in terms of why we went to the UCC, it wasn't to make life more difficult for the neighborhood or Councilman Brown, it was to try to get the code clean.\nSpeaker 7: It sensor wasn't that much gain or difference between the two.\nSpeaker 4: That's right.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Kyle, I want to ask a clarifying question, and if you could put up the map that shows the site. What I'm trying to clarify is if the current curb cuts to the property.\nSpeaker 2: Our what is expected to be utilized as ingress and egress for the site.\nSpeaker 4: So so there's actually nothing in the zoning that speaks directly to that, but that the applicant site plan that he's proposing here is wouldn't add any new driveway. So it's just the two existing driveways that are on both on the cube smart property.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And any idea how traffic would respond to that?\nSpeaker 4: And you had conversations. So that's probably better for Paul.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 10: Yeah. Thanks for asking the question. It's a good one. The the traffic light and exposition of the lead still. And we took this measurement at rush hour three weeks ago, roughly. But that traffic light is green for a minute and 45 seconds and is read for like 18 seconds.\nSpeaker 10: And that means that the city has designed things properly because they want that traffic on resale to flow southeast. So the reality is, if if someone.\nSpeaker 6: Came in here personally.\nSpeaker 10: And decided to go this way, we're going to have to cross the speed bumps, which will be a detriment to go left here over to this light. And if they happen to hit the minute and 45 seconds of red light to make the right turn on leads, they'll they'll probably only do that once or twice because it's\nSpeaker 10: a it's very awkward and it's more time consuming than just flowing with the traffic on lead still.\nSpeaker 2: So can you clarify if the business CU Smart is that within the triangle of this property if they have approved the speed bumps. Because I heard somebody say that this was something that had to be approved by smart.\nSpeaker 10: The the speed. Let me go back one step. This is the property that we own here. It's roughly an acre. This piece here is owned by Kim Smart.\nSpeaker 1: So the two access points are.\nSpeaker 10: Actually on the cube smart property. We have a reciprocal easement agreement to use that for ingress, egress and and access to to our property. The this the speed bumps will be on Q smart property. And they say they suggested to us that we put speed bumps in because we had gone to them and asked them if they\nSpeaker 10: would agree to closing off that exit. And they said no, but we would agree to put speed bumps in on our property, provided they're properly designed. So we have a yes for that.\nSpeaker 2: Do they have to also approve signage on the site that discourages traffic exiting onto exposition?\nSpeaker 10: No, not on our property. They don't have to prove that. But on their property we can put signs here. We would have to give their blessing. Yes.\nSpeaker 2: So that such signage does not exist today, is that correct?\nSpeaker 10: No, it's it's not.\nSpeaker 2: It's something. What kind of business is cute? Smart? I'm not sure. Okay.\nSpeaker 10: Sure.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.\nSpeaker 10: But I'd just like to make one comment on that agreement. With that came as a result of the meeting with Councilman Brown and Bob Golic and the association. Is that my understanding is that there was some general issues discussed and a letter agreement could be executed fairly quickly, which would then go to an attorney.\nSpeaker 10: He'd make it a legal document, which we would record against the property as restrictions. So and that's the same with Steve Charbonneau in mediation. He said we if we'd come to an agreement with the association, something could be done very quickly and then convert it to a legal document that would be a binding document as required action\nSpeaker 10: against the property.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Any other members of the council? Just one final question. So if that was something that was agreed to tonight, would those in attendance who have spoken against it agree to that? Because I heard one of the concerns that there was no binding way that this was going to be enforced if it's recorded against the property\nSpeaker 2: . I see that as being enforceable. It's just a shake of heads. Could that be helpful from what we understand? Okay. If you're going to speak, I need you to come to the phone to identify yourself again, please. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Nigel Smith, 739 South Korea Street. What we've been told is that any any type of agreements, whether it goes through an attorney or not, cannot be tied to the deed and that it's unenforceable. So, yes, we could agree on it at this point.\nSpeaker 0: But six months down the road, if a if a drive thru is installed, then we would wind up in a in a court battle and it would not have been held enforceable.\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's different than him saying he was willing and agreeing to recorded against the property. Which which would be fine.\nSpeaker 0: From what we understand, is you cannot record that against the property. It's similar to a good neighbor agreement and it's unenforceable.\nSpeaker 2: So we're all looking to our city attorney. So, David, can you just clarify that point?\nSpeaker 8: We have several city attorneys in the room tonight, including ones who have been following this throughout. But as long as I've got the mike, let me just remind you all that the applicant has a right to have his application voted up or down tonight in our system.\nSpeaker 8: The opponents have a right to urge you to vote it down. This is not the appropriate opportunity to be negotiating the terms and conditions of the approval from the floor on a monday night. And we consistently give that advice.\nSpeaker 8: Now, we've we've been called upon to answer questions like this before in terms of the panoply of ways that applicants may enter into third party agreements with neighbors or with neighborhood groups. And it's difficult for us to sit here on a monday night and opine on the specific enforceability of any particular instrument.\nSpeaker 8: When I listen to the testimony here tonight, one of the things I hear is that is that there may have been some offer, some proposal to have a covenant on the property running with the land that might have imposed certain use or design restrictions on the property.\nSpeaker 8: But to whom does that run? And what's the quid pro quo in terms of who would then be bound to offer something back on the other side, such as not challenging this rezoning decision here tonight? That's the difficulty, is structuring a quid pro quo that everybody can be absolutely assured is enforceable at the end of the day\nSpeaker 8: . And it's very difficult for the city attorney's office, any of us, to opine about the ultimate enforceability against whom, in terms of any instrument that they might have come up with on the side. It's not a city document.\nSpeaker 8: It's not the something the city is a party to, and therefore it's not really inside the lines in terms of the role the council is playing tonight, in terms of either approving this rezoning application application or denying it.\nSpeaker 8: Now I'm going to turn to my colleagues who have been working on this, who may be more familiar with what the various proposed quid pro quo is, and see if Knight Lucero wants to comment in addition to anything I said.\nSpeaker 6: Good afternoon, Madam President. Members of the council names here with the city attorney's office. And I agree with what Mr. Broadwell said. The council can I can approve this application or deny the application. I suppose there would be another option where.\nSpeaker 11: Council would be authorized to.\nSpeaker 4: Approve this with conditions, but that comes.\nSpeaker 6: With a host of procedural complications that would delay this process further. So I would just extend that to to council that that would be the third alternative.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Brooks, would you be okay with my letting Councilman Brown go before you?\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. Matter of fact, you can take me off a list. Okay. David summed up my thought.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Brown.\nSpeaker 8: Did you say taking you out of the building, or can I have you back at the podium, please? And your first name is that. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 7: Nate.\nSpeaker 8: Nate, Nate, let me ask you. The city has on contract community mediation concepts. And Steve Charbonneau heads up that nonprofit organization that does provide conflict resolution mediation and facilitation services for the city. They've done it for years. So what happens when they work out an agreement?\nSpeaker 8: Between neighbors and developers. What happens? When Steve Charbonneau heads up is he heads before in my district and it's worked out fine and I've never heard this.\nSpeaker 6: Well, Councilman Brown, I think that would be an agreement between the parties, whether that's the developer and some neighborhood.\nSpeaker 11: Organization it possibly is recorded against against the property's deed restriction.\nSpeaker 6: Or something along those lines. But again, the city is is typically, in my understanding, wouldn't be a party.\nSpeaker 4: To that agreement.\nSpeaker 6: And Mr. Broadwell, of course, can correct me if I'm incorrect.\nSpeaker 8: Is that a no comment? Consider that now I in this case, I'm agreeing with Mr. Lucero. That's true. We're not a party to those contracts. I'll just relate. There are situations where I don't know what goes on inside that black box in terms of how it's enforceable and whether or not they have any problem with parties outside\nSpeaker 8: the box may be blowing up the deal. I agree with you, Councilman Brown. Very often when these things have gotten squared away through mediation, we haven't seen secondary problems later on. Occasionally we do. But but in general, we don't.\nSpeaker 8: How it sticks. You know, how they hold it together. I'm not entirely sure. I do know of cases in other cities in Colorado where you may have an agreement with a neighborhood association. But then later on, one individual property owner goes rogue and decides to challenge or oppose the rezoning proposal anyway.\nSpeaker 8: Right. So. So it's only as good as the parties who are signatory to the deal and whether or not it's entirely squared away in terms of any potential violations on the one side or the other is not something as as the neighbor indicated, we're either a party to nor do we track very closely.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, David. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman. Councilman. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: So if I. If I understand correctly, if it's a part, it's a it's usually an arrangement between the developer and the neighborhood. And the city is not a party to it. Does that mean that whether we vote for the zoning or against, they could still afterwards enter into such a agreement that would have the same kind of\nSpeaker 1: legal binding that it would have had they decided on it beforehand. That being separate from city processes, it's still a possible action. If they wish to.\nSpeaker 8: Private parties are always at liberty to negotiate restrictive covenants on property among themselves. Whether they have a zoning pending is just approved, never approved. That's always the property interest and covenants and servitude in between adjacent private property owners is something they're always free to negotiate among themselves.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Any other questions from members of council? The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council Feltham and Brown.\nSpeaker 8: Five more months. I tell you, I don't enjoy this again. What I try to do is resolve problems. Not a very glamorous job, but I certainly tried in this effort. I thought after we had the meeting in my office that we had a deal.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, there were some technical things. You got to get the lawyers. All right? But I really thought we had a deal. And I might add that Bob Golic thought we had a deal as well. So I turned to him after that didn't work out.\nSpeaker 8: And if I can, I'm going to quote two presidents tonight, which I've never done. And the first quote would be from Lincoln, Our last, best hope. And in my judgment, I thought our last, best hope on this agreement, on this particular case was community mediation concepts, because they had worked and I've worked with Steve and he has\nSpeaker 8: brought neighbors together. In this case, it didn't work out. I referred to my colleagues to the letter that he wrote us. February the 20th, this year, I believe that was what, Friday, where he says that he talks about the number of hours over the past two days talking with both parties regarding the proposed zone change.\nSpeaker 8: In the end, my efforts in mediation were not successful. Paragraph The neighbors represented by the two parties here tonight felt very strongly that any change he's talking about, the neighbors in the zoning would cause an intolerable increase in traffic as well as drive through issues in the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 8: They were all also concerned about noise and light pollution. They didn't believe any condition can or would be enforced. Third paragraph, Mr. Nuttall agreed to speed bumps, a dip and additional signage at the property's exit onto exposition. He agreed that no quote, food related, close quote drive thru would be allowed.\nSpeaker 8: But in the end, these concessions were not seen to provide adequate solutions by the neighbors. Very specifically, the neighbors express a complete opposition to anything other than the zoning remaining as it is for 45, 84. The other president.\nSpeaker 8: John Kennedy said, never negotiate out of fear, but never fear to negotiate. And I think that was the problem, frankly, with the neighbors. They feared to negotiate. And I'm sorry. I think the developer would agree to no drive thrus because that was the problem that was presented.\nSpeaker 8: A planning board. I thought that was. A very sincere effort to resolve this issue. And it wasn't enough. So I'm going to support this rezoning tonight, and I hope my colleagues understand what I've been going through. It's been long, it's been difficult, but I still think this is fair in the long run.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Brown. There are other comments from my colleagues. Councilman Rob.\nSpeaker 7: Did you say me? Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. Yeah. Charlie, I have a lot of sympathy for what's been going on and a lot of admiration for the leadership that you have showed or tried to show.\nSpeaker 7: But this is really one of the most frustrating reasoning. Zero. In all honesty, I come into many rezonings in council, not quite having made up my mind. That is still the case in this rezoning. Tonight, as I make these comments, I can understand the neighbors frustration.\nSpeaker 7: This has been a long disputed site going back to when Polly Flowback represented the other side of the street in DPS, couldn't sell the property. And then eight years ago, thanks for jogging my memory. It was resound in it and I can see where the neighbors say, hey, what's different in the way we put that in?\nSpeaker 7: Trying to decide if we're going to rezone is do we have changing conditions? That's quite a broad term. There's a lot that changes. There's a lot that stays the same. And I'm I'm really trying to think about that.\nSpeaker 7: If the B one uses were okay eight years ago and Blueprint Denver had already been approved. I'm trying to figure that one out. I also I'm not crazy about what is now happening and I understand it, but I'm just I struggle with it.\nSpeaker 7: That, of course, the community planning and development and zoning.\nSpeaker 1: Can't.\nSpeaker 7: Predict traffic, can't design the roads in the city, can't install traffic control devices. But I do think and I've had to make these tough decisions and often have had neighborhood opposition for it. But I do think that when we consider a rezoning, we can consider what we know into it, what the traffic study say about traffic under\nSpeaker 7: the clear qualification that we have to decide if this benefits public health, safety and welfare. So I understand that, you know, and I'm just I'm stuck. We could have had a win win. I think we could have had as a situation under negotiation where there was a nice buffer between the site as shown in landscaping.\nSpeaker 7: We wouldn't have had a vacant lot and we could have had no drive through. Now we really I mean, we wouldn't have had the vacant lot. Now we really have to decide between one undeveloped site in something else.\nSpeaker 7: So I don't know if anybody else is going to weigh in, but I find this a really hard decision.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman Rob Council. Councilwoman Sussman.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Madam President. I like you, Councilwoman Robb. I find it a very difficult decision to and I. I can I can understand both points of view. The it is a commercial corridor and one wants to maximize what you can do out of a land like this.\nSpeaker 1: But I think, too, there was just some confusion about how an agreement might work between neighborhoods and the developer and perhaps some feeling of of Russian rashness and how and how we could maybe work this out. So I am still debating the decision myself, but like our atlas of the decision, I feel like there is and there\nSpeaker 1: is still an opportunity for that win win that might not have happened. Before tonight. I still feel like there is that possibility. I hear I hear willingness on the part of the neighbors. I hear willingness on the part of the developer.\nSpeaker 1: At least there was at one time a willingness to talk about these things and see what works out best.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Sussman. Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. I also share the same frustration. Which is why I was asking some of the questions that I was asking. You know, on one hand, from the neighborhood perspective, I'm sure that if council votes this up tonight, you're going to feel like you've lost your leverage to be able\nSpeaker 2: to work this out with the proposed developer on the project. And from the from your perspective, I'm sure you're feeling like, well, you know, you want to be able to proceed with the project. And I would just hope that this is not the end of the communication that would happen if council decides to move this project forward\nSpeaker 2: . I think the issue of pedestrian safety for students is going to be a real issue. The traffic concerns that the neighborhood has, if the volume of traffic is increased, you've got more trips in and out of the site compared to what's there today.\nSpeaker 2: I can understand the concerns that the families have about that. But at the same time, I'm struggling here with the fact that you guys were this close, this close to having this nailed down to address the concerns. And my hope is that this is not the end of that.\nSpeaker 2: Being able to still work it out, you know, with rezonings of council votes it down. The applicant has to wait a whole year before being able to bring it back and only the council person of the district can file an application to bring something back before that year timeframe.\nSpeaker 2: I don't know where we're all on this issue. You know, this is something we can't and we don't talk about. But my hope is that this you know, I still don't know how I'm going to vote yet. I'm struggling with, you know, just the the tug and pull here between creating an opportunity and in allowing something that\nSpeaker 2: could serve the community there. But at the same time, trying to address those issues of concern that would impact the neighborhoods. And I just want to say to both of you, I hope you guys can keep that dialog open and try to find a way to to resolve this.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Kinney.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Madam President, I was not planning to speak, but since several of my colleagues shared that they were still hemming and hawing, I thought I would weigh in to share that I will be supporting this rezoning tonight because I do believe it meets the criteria.\nSpeaker 1: I think that many times we have neighborhoods or communities who come before this council and share that they feel that they don't have any control. And what they mean is they can't stop a project. They can't stop change from happening.\nSpeaker 1: But in fact, time and time again, I hear them having influence over things based on setbacks, setbacks, design, concessions. Neighborhoods in this city have an enormous amount of influence over development through these processes. And you you know, I think that this community had that chance.\nSpeaker 1: And sometimes you let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And I can't account for that. I am here to evaluate whether this is a commercial corridor lead, still is a commercial corridor. And, you know, if you drive along it, you can see many areas where that commercial corridor on the front side then has residential on\nSpeaker 1: the back side. But that exists throughout this corridor. If I make that if I make the decision that this block can't be commercial because there's residential behind it, I can't be consistent. Then for the remainder of this corridor of the remainder of Colorado Boulevard or the other major commercial corridors in this city where one block behind them\nSpeaker 1: exists residential. And so, you know, I don't have the qualms that I've heard from some of my colleagues because I I am left with the criteria. And this rezoning meets those criteria. I'm sad for folks that they didn't feel like they got the perfect deal.\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, having spent many of my years before serving on council, negotiating with developers and I understand the city attorney's position that that he cannot advise you or even us on the on the on the enforceability of a hypothetical agreement, covenants that run with the land.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know of many situations where they're violated. And I think you got bad legal advice if you were told that they were not something you could rely upon, because we have many neighborhoods who rely upon them in other types of situations, whether it's affordable housing covenants, it's a very common tool.\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, I'm not the city attorney, so I can opine on things he can't. But so so with that, I just felt like it was important for me to weigh in and state that, you know, our job is to evaluate this and the criteria.\nSpeaker 1: This is a commercial corridor. It is a reasonable use. And we should approve this tonight.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilwoman Kennish, any other comments by members of council?

I'm going to I'm going to start, if you don't mind. Yes. So tonight we have before you the second year of our two year budget. As you know, we adopt a two year budget, and this is the second year of that.\nSpeaker 4: And if you noticed in your packet we took this year, since this is the second year, we took the opportunity to refresh our budget document. And I'm going to show it to folks at home on the dias and at home.\nSpeaker 4: This is not the typical doorstop that we normally produce. This is actually a storybook about our budget. It has a lot of good information in it, and I really encourage folks to take a look at it. It's not.\nSpeaker 4: It's actually pretty interesting. I mean, as interesting as a budget can be. But it's it's good.\nSpeaker 0: That's our acting city manager, Liz Warmer. Dan telling us that this is an interesting document.\nSpeaker 4: It really is. It's as good as our city in the past. I know that. It just it's it's a graphic presentation, really, of our budget. And it really does a good job of explaining where all of our money goes, where our challenges are.\nSpeaker 4: Some of our programs, things that are that we're going to be looking at into the next year. So it's really a great document. I encourage everybody to take a look. And thank you to our our finance staff. And you all met Susan Mayor, who helped us put it together.\nSpeaker 4: So the other thing, I just I just want to give you a quick overview. This is a refresher for the council, but maybe for the first time for people in the public. This budget document essentially tells us how we're going to end the fiscal year.\nSpeaker 4: So fiscal year 1718, which is what we're in right now, it'll end June 30 and we're actually in fairly decent shape in this fiscal year. We'll end with 4.5 million above what our it's actually a surplus and that's primarily as a result of our transfer tax and our property tax and transfer tax for those of you who\nSpeaker 4: don't know is when a property sells, we get a portion of those sales. That's one time we're in a very strong economic cycle. And so our transfer tax is doing very well as a result this year. We're actually looking pretty good.\nSpeaker 4: Next year into 1819. We anticipated we actually anticipated when we did this to your budget that we would be in a deficit position of 2.8 million. And as it turns out, we're looking at actually having a balanced budget in fiscal year 1819.\nSpeaker 4: So that's a that's a and that also includes the few asks that the department had over this past year. So we're in good shape for 1819. In the out years as council is aware, we do have deficits starting with about a half a million in fiscal year 1920 and and it'll go out into five years, roughly around\nSpeaker 4: four and a half million dollars in a deficit. But as you know, and as council hopefully will recall, we always are working to eliminate deficits. We have conservative spending, we pay down our unfunded liabilities. And we're continuing to look at ways to increase revenue, including cost recovery.\nSpeaker 4: And later at the next council meeting, we'll be talking to you about the revenue potential revenue measure for sales tax on July 10th. So all of this is essentially with an eye of keeping us healthy and ensuring that we have our reserve of essentially a adopted policy of 25%.\nSpeaker 4: So that's kind of the overview. I just wanted to provide sort of the backdrop, and then I'm going to hand it over to Miss Adair.\nSpeaker 8: Good evening, Madumere. Members of the council, Elaina Dare finance director and I actually do want a second acting city manager about the this particular document. It was a big undertaking and a huge thank you to the entire finance team, and especially Edwin Gotto and Susan Mayer, who is a consultant that assisted with moving this document forward and\nSpeaker 8: making sure it gets done. So they were all able to do it while I was gone, and I am very grateful for that.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 8: There's a few items that we're going to go through, a lot of the slides you will find familiar, and we went through them in great detail during the May 18th workshop. So unless you have specific questions, we're probably going to go through them fairly quickly.\nSpeaker 8: We one of the things we will discuss is talk a little bit about overall citywide budget and expenditures. We'll talk a little bit about general fund and some other funds. We'll look at the five year forecast and of course, the next steps.\nSpeaker 8: So this particular graph represents operating budget for the city. And as you will see, the top departments, the largest departments are police, fire and public works. As I mentioned, this is operating budget. This does not include capital. Capital usually fluctuates.\nSpeaker 8: But for your knowledge, this year's 1819 new money budgeted was about $31 million for the capital projects. In terms of general fund and what's the current status? As I mentioned, we're kind of went through the details of this at May 19th meeting.\nSpeaker 8: There were a couple of items that were added since then that had to be addressed. There were some adjustments, various adjustments to revenues such as our first responder advanced life support revenues. We do know now that 1718 revenue will be will be recognized this year.\nSpeaker 8: So we did adjust that and that was about $200,000. The other large item was we did include, as we mentioned to you, the employment settlement agreement. So those items are now included and are reflected in the numbers that you will see on the next page, on the next slide.\nSpeaker 8: So this is the representation. This is what, as of right now, we believe how we will end the current fiscal year for just a visual. We did break it down between baseline revenues and expenditures as well as took out some of the large one time items.\nSpeaker 8: In this particular case, it was the transfer tax and then of course the pension and OPEB reserves or the payments that we've made that were more on a one time basis. Even though we have a policy, we don't necessarily make the same payment every year and therefore they are taken out in the separate line.\nSpeaker 8: So if we just look at the baseline operations with a couple of the items included that I just mentioned earlier, we expect we will be about $100,000. Our revenues a little shorter than our expenditures. Again, if you take out particularly that one time payment or expenditure, we would have been in a positive, but with that particular item\nSpeaker 8: with threw us into a deficit for the year. With the taxes, however, with the large tax that we have, it would have put us in a positive. And the large tax was from three particular parcels that happened that amounted to $4.6 million.\nSpeaker 8: Again, transfer tax is a volatile revenue source and was really dependent on real estate sales. So it's really difficult to say, well, what does it really mean? Unless you really compare it to something and say, well, is it better or is it worse?\nSpeaker 8: And so as a comparative. Five years ago in May, this particular slide was presented to then city council members and the picture was that we May and 1718 with $8.3 million deficit. So what does that really mean? In our case, if we do nothing, just like it says on the slide.\nSpeaker 8: This is where we may have ended up, but we don't do nothing. We address whether expenditures or revenues, and we have to have a balanced budget and we try to bring it and work on it every year to bring the balanced budget to council for approval.\nSpeaker 8: So that's what we are doing now. So this is as a comparative.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I'm sorry. Before you move on. The increase in the transfer taxes, how much of an impact or what do you think? How much of an impact did they have on these numbers?\nSpeaker 8: I just want to make sure I understand you're asking for an increase between back then.\nSpeaker 0: Versus difference of. But right you have. We thought that the forecasts have been a bigger deficit numbers than what we currently have. And some of that is, I think, attributed to the increase the moneys that we received from these transfer taxes, sales of buildings.\nSpeaker 0: Right, other more revenue and things like that than we had been able to forecast.\nSpeaker 8: Correct. So the revenues in general are higher. If you see in here, if you just look at the baseline, excluding large one time items, currently overall revenues would have been at $95 million. If you actually look what we thought we might have back five years ago, we thought we're going to have about $78 million.\nSpeaker 8: So overall, taxes went up. Largely, it's probably attributed to a property tax because back then that's when the recession hit. So it's more likely that the property taxes actually went up significantly higher, plus the new development that happened within the city, which brings it up higher with the new homes that were put on the market.\nSpeaker 8: And that's part of it. Of course, transfer tax is one of them because as it grows with the assessed value, your transfer tax grows as well. Unfortunately, I don't have right now numbers to say specifically which tax went up and how much between what was and now.\nSpeaker 8: But overall, you can tell the difference is almost $20 million swing.\nSpeaker 0: So I just so I want to point that out, though, because. Right. So you're looking at growth in property taxes, that because of the increase in equity, I mean, not equity, but the cost, right? The home home values increase in phrase values and sale values, which we cannot necessarily assume will continue at that level.\nSpeaker 0: So we've been able to bring in additional moneys because of that. Right. That may not many people think we can't continue to have that same trend. So so I want to just drill down a little bit on that.\nSpeaker 0: So the audience is aware of why, you know, the biggest contributor of us having been in such good shape financially right now compared to where we thought we were going to be. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: So now that we looked at 17, 18 and did the comparison, let's look at the 1819 and we'll start with our revenues. As we just talked, property taxes are the biggest component of the revenues within general funds, over 30%.\nSpeaker 8: Then the next one follows in 1718, particular because of some of the one time receipts that we had, it was a number two source. As you can see in 1819, we increased it even though we don't expect certain wants to come in again that high, it's fluctuates between second and the third revenue source in the city and\nSpeaker 8: it's usually competes with the sales tax. Now one of the things that we have done is with sales tax. We consult with Diehl and their consultant and they helped us project where we may think we may end up with the sales tax and their projections showing that we should be remaining flat going forward in like the next\nSpeaker 8: five year period. Those are the largest top three largest revenue sources. There's one cost allocation that's changed a little bit that looks a little odd. We have talked about it during the workshop and reality is it didn't just go away.\nSpeaker 8: It just offsets the expenditures within the fund. So for exactly that same amount. Okay. Overall, $4 million swing between adopted budget that was adopted a year ago versus now. And it's about half a million dollar difference between what we've presented at midyear in March versus now.\nSpeaker 8: Again, the two largest contributors were actually one is transfer tax. As we look closer to it and see what it will be. That's majority of that, half a million. And then there's a slight increase for CPI for the transfer from Alameda Municipal Power.\nSpeaker 8: All the rest of the taxes are expected to be the same, and we've talked about it in detail. So unless you have questions, I'm going to move on. Expenditures have not changed since the last time we've done the presentation and during the workshop again it's the same thing.\nSpeaker 8: Our salaries went up by about half a million dollars. However, because of your policy that you adopted for pension and OPEB and setting funds aside with pay down, it actually to date saved us and we're projecting that it's saving us about $1,000,000.\nSpeaker 8: So the offset actually ended up making it and then did change negative reduction in expenditures by about half a million. So this is a presentation for you in a chart form. The during the workshop as you know we've come to you and departments requested certain augmentations to the budget that you already approved a year ago.\nSpeaker 8: That $1 million is representative of those requests. And we'll go into detail a little more to talk about them. But one of the things that I wanted to present to you and just kind of point out City Council's available fund balance reserve is 25% and that currently is represented in the Midcycle projection column of about $22.8 million\nSpeaker 8: . What you will see in the other bucket where it says 50% of surplus, about 25% target. So that shows a split which we currently project for 1819, if everything is going to be as we've predicted, or at least as good as we've predicted.\nSpeaker 8: We believe that based on the policy that we currently have for pension and OPEB funding, we may be able to set aside close to $4 million at the end of the year. We do not appropriate those funds, as you may remember.\nSpeaker 8: We wait till we actually finish the fiscal year and then we come to you and ask to appropriate the money based on the policy. But this is the our current estimate as to what we may be able to put in.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Before you move on by voting for this budget, does that include setting aside any money to pay down the reserves.\nSpeaker 8: At this point?\nSpeaker 3: Oops.\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to show Patricia.\nSpeaker 3: Know. Uh huh.\nSpeaker 8: Um. Sorry.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8: So that the $3.9 million or almost $4 million is not budgeted. So when you approve it, we expect that number to be that number. But it's only a reserve in the general fund. It's not actually appropriated. Because we don't we can't actually do it.\nSpeaker 8: We could, but because we truly don't know what the picture is going to be at the end of the year if something happens better or worse, this is a best estimate. Budget is an art, so this is our artistic way to represent what that number will be.\nSpeaker 8: And then once we know, once the fiscal year closed 1819. So at some point after June 30th. Usually happens in the fall of, in this case, 19 year fiscal year 2019. We'll come back to you and say we've closed the books.\nSpeaker 8: Now, this is the real number appropriated based on the policy and it's always looking backwards.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: So this particular slide gives you a summary for just the general fund. We've talked extensively in detail about which departments had which augmentation requests. So this is just a summary representing what each department within General Fund has requested.\nSpeaker 8: And we'll go through a little bit of a detail, but it's about $1,000,000. For the fire department. There were two things that council did not support during the workshop, and they were removed in that training captain and also a fire marshal.\nSpeaker 8: Those would have been ongoing costs. What's left at this point here mostly are costs that are a onetime in nature. There are some minor ongoing operating costs, but not significant. For a police department and the rest of the department.\nSpeaker 8: There's nothing really new, with the exception of one of the items that council requested to put in is for a three year period. Legal Aid Fund. We have talked to the community development director and city attorney's office and based on when the RFP might come out for these type of services, it was appropriate at this time to\nSpeaker 8: appropriate $100,000. And once we have that program going forward, we still have an additional 400,000, half a million in total that will be set aside for this specific purpose. However, the Community Development Director wanted to clarify some of the items related to the legal aid, and it's specifically related asking counsel if this was meant to be for\nSpeaker 8: renters or renters and landlords. And I'm going to ask her to speak to that.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening and good evening to mayor and council members. We are in at the workshop in May we had understood the direction to staff from council was to set up a three year pilot program. $500,000 for legal aid for low income renters.\nSpeaker 4: And then we affirmed what we had understood the direction from council to be at the June 5th meeting when we were discussing the rent program fee. However, there have been some subsequent questions about whether or not this program was intended to include services, legal services for low income landlords.\nSpeaker 4: And so we just wanted to take this opportunity to confirm the direction that we had understood, which was a legal aid program for low income renters.\nSpeaker 0: Amber Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I think I may have brought this up at the Budget Workshop that if there was a way we could do means testing and that there.\nSpeaker 3: Were.\nSpeaker 5: You know, individual landlords maybe limited by, you know, how you would set it up. But I'll bet you have some ideas, number of units in their income and assets that might be appropriate because I know in speaking with the housing authority there.\nSpeaker 5: Well, and I think your staff as well often gets questions from landlords wanted to make sure they're abiding by the ordinance.\nSpeaker 0: That was my understanding, though, that they would still be able to in regards to abiding by the ordinances that you want to address those comments.\nSpeaker 4: I'm sorry, could you repeat call?\nSpeaker 0: Could you could you respond to member Ashcroft's comments in regards to how the landlords do they need counsel and an attorney to get direction of how to abide by the ordinance? Is that something that is available to them or do they utilize outside attorneys also?\nSpeaker 4: Well, program administrator staff gives direction to landlords about what their requirements are pursuant to our ordinance. So for example, you often hear that noticing requirements that if a landlord has incorrectly noticed a landlord and they call staff will point the landlord to the language in the ordinance and clarify what the notice needs to say to be compliant\nSpeaker 4: with our ordinance. So they definitely step definitely and they do the same for for tenants. So staff does that work. But staff does not provide individual legal advice for landlords based on kind of facts, specific questions that they might have our attorneys interpret and defend our ordinance, but not the individual not individual landlord or tenant cases.\nSpeaker 0: Of life where.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, one of the things that we've consistently heard is essentially and what you just said to translate it is that if you are a landlord, you can go to the Housing Authority, who is our administrator, and get clarification about how you would go about evicting somebody in line with Ordinance 3148 or how you would go about\nSpeaker 7: implementing a rent increase without violating the ordinance. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 4: Yes. That they are instructed on how to comply with the ordinance.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. And I think, you know, at least from my my intent with this in terms of the pilot program, is that we've heard from many of our constituents on the tenant side that because essentially one group is going to the administrator getting clarification that it would be helpful to have a separate office, basically advising them of what\nSpeaker 7: their rights may be or what their protections may be under the ordinance. And so, at least from my perspective, I think the ask was that it be bifurcated that way is, you know, in looking at the other programs that exist where legal services are provided as part of the RFP, for instance, or as part of the contract\nSpeaker 7: for service, do some of these providers look at their personal declarations of income level in terms of taking a case?\nSpeaker 4: I don't know how I don't know how the means testing is done. But we can say that when we looked at other jurisdictions that offer the legal services, those jurisdictions offer the services for low income tenants only. They don't offer this the comparable services to landlords.\nSpeaker 4: And we don't know if we were to means test the landlords. And clearly they have assets, right, because they're renting, they have investment property. We don't know how that that means testing would be undertaken and we don't know if I don't we don't believe that the legal services attorneys would take the landlord cases.\nSpeaker 4: So if the direction of the council was intended to be to provide services to both low income tenants and landlords, we would recommend that we do a little more research about how that would work on the landlords side and that we move forward with the tenant side at this time.\nSpeaker 5: Where can I go back to my statement?\nSpeaker 2: So next in line, I think.\nSpeaker 0: We can take turns, right? I'm going to go to but we're going to come back here.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 5: So I'm actually going to modify what I just I.\nSpeaker 2: I don't remember any question about landlords getting legal assistance, so I don't remember that discussion at all. I remember any direction. I know I didn't say it, so I don't know where that idea came from. So to me, the direction is clear that we wanted to assist tenants.\nSpeaker 2: And as you just said, you know, landlords have assets. You know, sometimes they say it's their retirement, but they actually own property. So I don't understand why we would be want to give free legal service to people that could easily go.\nSpeaker 2: Or maybe not easily, but at least have the capacity to borrow on their property. Which tenants don't have that capacity? You know, a lot of them are living month to month. So I don't know where that idea came from.\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, I thought we were doing 500,000. I'm so not clear why we're doing only 100. You know, it seems like we gave clear direction to give 500,000 as seed money for legal aid for renters, and now it's down to 100 and be now we're talking about giving it to tenants or landlords.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm totally like clueless on how we got to this point. I thought our direction was clear.\nSpeaker 0: It was warmer than yes.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Absolutely. The direction was clear about the 500,000. So that money is set aside. What we're budgeting is this year only. So that 500,000 is without a doubt it is set aside, it is restricted. So it's a restricted fund balance.\nSpeaker 4: We wanted to we wanted an estimate of how much we thought we would be spending this year. So if we spend more than 100,000 this year, then we can come back. The money is still there. There has been discussion and it may not have been on the 18th, but there has been discussion in the past about landlord\nSpeaker 4: and tenant and that's where that's that came up. And we just wanted to get clarification.\nSpeaker 0: So I do recall the issue being raised, I believe, at the workshop at the library, and I'm not quite sure why we're talking about the program to this degree during the budget meeting because honestly, I would like to look at both.\nSpeaker 0: I'm agree I am willing to look at low income landlords and tenants. I would like to know the types of services we would be entertaining for, for all of it, because you could have different scenarios that may or may not be appropriate.\nSpeaker 0: But I'd like to have more time too. And now we have a speaker set if as possible. I think we've agreed to allocate the money and then maybe we could come back and actually have a better discussion.\nSpeaker 5: On it if I were asked. Thank you. And so actually the topic was raised and it's certainly valid to consider. However, after hearing Ms.. Potter tell us that the programs that you've looked at are all directed towards serving low income tenants, I think that makes perfect sense, and I'm willing to withdraw the suggestion.\nSpeaker 5: And the other thing I believe is that landlords have access, whether they're a small landlord or a large landlord. There are associations, professional associations of apartment owners and whatnot who can provide those sorts of legal services. So given that we never have enough resources to stretch as far as we would like, I think we probably should focus\nSpeaker 5: among tenants.\nSpeaker 4: So with confirmation of the direction, we then will be issuing the RFP and will be back to council in October is our schedule with a contract to award for the services. So we appreciate the confirmation of the direction.\nSpeaker 0: So then would we look at the types of services, legal services, whether it would be authorized for? At that time. When that comes back, will it come back to council for us to look at it any more?\nSpeaker 4: The reason that the reason staff was asking for confirmation of direction this evening was so that we could move forward with the RFP timely and be back to council in October. So what I'm hearing is that there there are three members of the council who have confirmed the directions for this step.\nSpeaker 0: I want to follow it. Okay. We have not really had a real exhaustive discussion on this issue. So I'm asking when you come back, are we going to talk about what services will be available to tenants.\nSpeaker 4: Will be coming back?\nSpeaker 0: Are we going to. Is this going to be something that now staff is off goes and does this and doesn't? I mean, honestly, we're in the middle of a budget meeting.\nSpeaker 4: We're going to come back with a proposed contract. Is is the plan. If council would prefer that we come back with the RFP, with the scope of services and then put out the RFP, we can't come back with the work scope till September.\nSpeaker 4: Otherwise the intent was to issue the RFP based on the direction we received and then come with the contract to award in October.\nSpeaker 0: So I personally would like to I'm at some point I think council should have the opportunity to weigh in on the types of legal services that are offered. And I don't know when we get that, when we get to see that because we have barely talked about this member matter.\nSpeaker 6: SC Um, first thing I want to say is that I understood that we were trying to do something to level the playing field, and it's already been spoken there. And I think we'll have that opportunity to have that discussion when you bring the contract back because the RFP, you've heard the nuances and know people will provide you\nSpeaker 6: with the services that they can provide us, and you're going to present a contract based on that. We can say, no, we don't like it or we can say Add this or take away that at that time. This is a budget meeting.\nSpeaker 6: I agree with the mayor that we need to we've got $500,000. You're going to anticipate spending 100,000 this year. So let's move the ball. Otherwise, we're going to be talking about this another six months down the road.\nSpeaker 0: I'm ready for now. So we have a speaker on this item. But this, I think, would go at the end of the item, right?\nSpeaker 5: I mean, well, I think we've given direction to staff before.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So are we going to be hearing from other items like that where we're going to have staff come up because we need to be able to get through the budget? We have other items, right?\nSpeaker 4: We do have other items. Madam Mayor. Um, this is an item I think that was a priority for the council. So staff felt like this was an appropriate time to, to discuss it as part of the budget. So there aren't that many other things that I think we need clarification on.\nSpeaker 4: But in also, if you do clarification from us, we're happy to provide that as well.\nSpeaker 5: We can take the public.\nSpeaker 0: Records, ask questions you have. Do you want to continue?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. I don't think it's appropriate.\nSpeaker 8: So I'm going to move on to the next slide.\nSpeaker 0: The Council for direction. I have a public speaker on the. Rent the tenant legal. Do we want to allow that speaker to come up at this time? You may want to interrupt the meeting and take a.\nSpeaker 4: We actually don't have that. How many more slides do you have, Lena? Um, I don't think we have that many.\nSpeaker 8: We'll go through the accounts.\nSpeaker 7: We're halfway through.\nSpeaker 4: I think you might have other speakers on other items so you can wait and take the DNA.\nSpeaker 0: So we're going to wait in the speakers at the end of the presentation. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 8: So moving on again, you have seen this particular items already. The only to that I would like to point out for you is the save for grant and community paramedic. And Grant one ends in October of 2018, one ends in November of 2018.\nSpeaker 8: So the staff will have to come back to council and for further direction and figure out if we do have an additional funding at the time and if not, what steps we'll need to take. But that's one of those to just bring up to your attention.\nSpeaker 8: All of these items are the same and there was no changes since we talked in during the workshop. On this particular slide, the highlighted two highlighted items are new. They have not been presented to you during the workshop.\nSpeaker 8: However, the staff felt that we really wanted to include it because this will assist us with closing out and moving on the projects. There's two Seaplane Lagoon $2 million, and that additional $2 million will be paid equally 1 million from base reuse, 1 million from Tidelands.\nSpeaker 8: And you will see it actually going to increase the overall Seaplane Lagoon Ferry Terminal Project to nine and a half million dollars. And then just when you park an additional $223,000 will come from the recreation fund. Actually, it will be shared.\nSpeaker 8: $39 million comes from this new Park Foundation, from donations, and the remainder is from the recreation fund. And this is to finish up the project and completed for the construction. If you have any questions, we do have staff representatives here who can get more details.\nSpeaker 0: So these are new items, right? So it hasn't come to us before. So do you want to speak to what's the balance on all of those funds that you'd be taking this money from? Because we don't have a real report.\nSpeaker 3: Sure.\nSpeaker 4: I'm actually a staff report.\nSpeaker 3: Happy to summarize us here for the Seaplane Lagoon. The balance for the Base Trust Fund will now be 5.8 million and of 6.8 and 2.8 instead of.\nSpeaker 2: Earth.\nSpeaker 3: I think 2.4 instead of 3.4 for Thailand. So there's still pretty substantial fund balances in both those funds, which is why we made that recommendation.\nSpeaker 4: You all right?\nSpeaker 8: And this was called out as a separate slide. During the workshop, however, all of these have been included in the augmentations that are requested by the department. So everything you looked at already included these items, and we just thought it would be good to have a summarized version of the workforce changes that are proposed with the work\nSpeaker 8: budget.\nSpeaker 0: Sorry.\nSpeaker 2: Whenever I slide I have a question.\nSpeaker 8: Of course. So just to make it a little clear, if you have questions, I guess you can ask now, but there's only a re class for fire department and the difference between the two positions is very insignificant. It was about $5,000, I believe, maybe less.\nSpeaker 8: And the only other items included that are larger are obviously the fire department. And again, I mentioned just earlier that staff will come back to council once we know more, if the additional grant funding has been approved or if there are any directions that we'll need to take after October and November dates for those grants.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. My question was for our deputy chief. So he could walk up without my time running?\nSpeaker 3: No.\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. I guess I missed that. Rick's on back. Deputy Chief Mayor and council. So quick question. We discussed the fire marshal position because right now we have the fire chief doing two jobs, two high level full time jobs with one body.\nSpeaker 2: And there was a discussion that we were going to try to do a cost analysis, a Nexus study, so we could build the cost of that position, as well as all of the salary and benefits and OPEB and all that stuff into that cost structure.\nSpeaker 2: So can you just lay out the process real quick for me and how we would go about doing that? I mean, what are the requirements in order to get that in the cost study? Well, first of all, we have done a Nexus study to determine our cost for various for our services.\nSpeaker 2: But we cannot include something like the fire marshals position in that state because frankly, we don't have that position. So it would not be appropriate to. Factor that in the study included our cost for personnel, equipment, response, response and the amount of time that it takes for each of these various activities that we undertake.\nSpeaker 2: So I can remember we wanted to bring that back when we were able to have cost recovery. So how do we bring that back if we can't do cost recovery, do a study on it without the position of it's like a chicken and egg things.\nSpeaker 2: I'm a little confused.\nSpeaker 4: If I can jump in. So we are doing a we're updating the master fee schedule and that's going to include the public works department committee development and Fire and that and that's coming back to you in September and we can take a look at that.\nSpeaker 2: I'm still curious, though, how we can. How we can get cost recovery in the study if we don't have the position yet, we don't want to do the position until we have cost recovery. So. Well, that's true. I don't have an answer for you.\nSpeaker 2: Frankly, I we can't include that in the study because, frankly, we don't have the position. So it can't legally and morally, ethically, it couldn't be included in the study. And we'll never really be able to get cost recovery on it until we actually authorize the position.\nSpeaker 2: I mean, that's the way I would read that statement. And that's true.\nSpeaker 4: And yeah, I'm not certain that that's true. I mean, I'm thinking about, for example, the the rent program. Right. We didn't have the rent program up and running. We had an idea of how the rent program was going to run.\nSpeaker 4: And therefore, we we built the case study around that. So I don't know if Miss Potter remembers what came first, but I believe that we were able to develop that fee, even knowing that we were knowing that we were going to have future.\nSpeaker 2: Costs to people, to me, to different things. So I don't know who to believe. Well, I will say that when we go through the cost study, which we'll be doing this fall, we we won't include that in there because the position won't be we won't include it yet.\nSpeaker 2: We won't. Well, we can't as far as I know, unless somebody tells me or us otherwise. It's not something that's a position that we have. So it can't be factored in to that particular part of our costs, which be in the fire prevention division.\nSpeaker 4: We'll take a look at it.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's all I can tell you.\nSpeaker 4: Can you give us an understanding of what your what your concern is?\nSpeaker 0: And maybe you're also wanted to.\nSpeaker 4: Make a comment?\nSpeaker 2: My concern is that, you know, the direction that was given by a majority, not not me, was that we wanted to find cost recovery for this position before we added it. Yet the way I understand it, as Deputy Chief John back explained it to me, we can't get cost recovery until we create the position.\nSpeaker 2: So it's a chicken and egg thing. So. It's never going to happen if unless we do one thing or the other. So this is where I'm confused. Well, let's let us.\nSpeaker 4: Come back and answer that for you.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Because I don't think we we don't obviously we don't have any advice for.\nSpeaker 0: You would like to speak before you conclude your comments. He wants to weigh in.\nSpeaker 7: Vice mayor. So is it is it possible? Hearing from my colleague and I also had concerns just about the because of the scope of work being performed currently at site and the potential development coming up and things that we're looking at, making sure that we're we have the staff in that position and the oversight.\nSpeaker 7: And I do I did hear the chief's concern about being pulled in a number of different directions and also wanting to be sure that he could actually engage in cost recovery if we could have staff, at least look at that and come back to us.\nSpeaker 7: You know, I would like to see us work on that to find the funds to fund that position, the funds or the fees to cover that position. If we're if there isn't support from the rest of the council to to put it in the existing budget, which I at that meeting there was not.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mary Spencer. I will disclose that I met with Deputy Chief Sam Beck this week and we went over some of these exact points and I didn't bring my notes. But there is an impressive list of measures and programs that the fire department is looking at doing, starting some of them starting at the beginning of this\nSpeaker 5: next fiscal year, which starts July 1st. And and in my communication at the time, is that it would be extremely helpful to come back maybe in six months time and see how that all materialized rather than and I said this at the budget workshop rather than basing an expenditure on projected revenue increases, and I think it's very\nSpeaker 5: impressive and ambitious all the the things that this new chief and Deputy Chief Zubik are doing. They're a great team. But it I mean, speaking of chickens and eggs, these you know, I don't want to count our chickens before they hatch.\nSpeaker 5: I went to Davis. And then when we talk about, say, day, it's true. A lot of exciting things about to happen there. But we've also had some discussions about the the fiscal neutrality policy that exists out there. But I think, you know, my feeling was not at this time.\nSpeaker 5: But that's not saying a hard stop. No, but I just need more more information that we don't have the benefit of having yet. Thank you, Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Vice Mayor and the member Odie. So, guys, I'm sorry, I didn't know who wanted to go first.\nSpeaker 7: So is it, you know, is it possible? I mean, I guess my question to the acting city manager is if we could essentially do we need to approve the position but not fund it in order to do the fee study and the recovery study, the cost recovery plan?\nSpeaker 4: I'd like to actually just defer that question because we needed to do the research. My my, my gut is that if you have the work, you know, you have the work, then you can charge the fee. Okay. But I want to make sure I think we need to talk to legal.\nSpeaker 4: I think we need to have a conversation with the finance director and just understand what has to come. First, you have to have the position and does it have to be filled in order to charge the fee or if you know, the work is coming and you set your fee and then charge it knowing that you're going\nSpeaker 4: to have the position. So I don't have the answer to that tonight, but we will certainly come back and and and let you know.\nSpeaker 2: And my question was, do we have to approve this tonight? The budget? Yes.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. I mean, your budget needs to be adopted by June 30.\nSpeaker 2: And if we don't do it, then. Then what?\nSpeaker 4: I mean, you could do a continuing resolution. Leonard, do you want to answer the question if we don't adopt the budget tonight?\nSpeaker 8: My recommendation would be to adopt a budget and request to bring it back for that particular item. So I need to actually clarify the fees. My understanding the way it works in order to determine the fee. Currently the fire chief is performing that work and that time can be applied to the fee and therefore it's not just\nSpeaker 8: going away. So that amount of time that fire chief spent as a fire marshal would be calculated towards the cost of two words, determining the amount of the fee. So it's not just going away. And so once you start collecting it, that revenue is going to come in and you can actually look at it from that standpoint\nSpeaker 8: once the revenue is collected as well.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: So can you speak to how we did this when we had a fire chief long? How did. How did we handle this?\nSpeaker 4: How did we handle the inspection issue? As a fire marshal, maybe. Deputy Chief Sam. That can answer that.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?\nSpeaker 0: We used to have a fire chief long. Right. And we didn't have it this way that you were being asked under this new chief to change the way we've been doing it, right? That's what it sounds like. So why do we why is this an issue?\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's an issue, frankly, because of the increase in volume and in the work in the division. As you well know, back in 2009, we went through a massive recession and frankly, we didn't have much work in the fire prevention division at some levels.\nSpeaker 2: Now, we certainly always had inspections that we had to undertake. Unfortunately, there was quite a cut back in city services in that era because of the downturn in the economy, the fire department took a fairly substantial hit of a fire station, a number of staff members to managers, what we called division chiefs in the fire department.\nSpeaker 2: So there was quite a downturn in a number of positions in the fire department. So we're we're working our way back and we're we're working to try and keep up. But frankly, the work is increasing faster than, you know, the staff, per se, to keep up with that work.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I appreciate that answer. So in regards to we had some inspections. We looked at having non sworn people do that, maybe we can look at that again then if the fire department is having a hard time keeping up.\nSpeaker 4: I think we need. Sure. Yeah, we'd like to get if. We would need direction on that.\nSpeaker 0: Right. But so I'm going to suggest that that item come back, as I believe we heard earlier as a suggestion. Right. But that I'd like to look at in regards to how how do we best utilize our sworn firefighters to efficiently and effectively do their serve serve our community?\nSpeaker 0: So I would like to look at the issue of the not because that came to us. It was a split vote in regards to having a non sworn to considering non sworn people to do the inspections as opposed to using sworn.\nSpeaker 0: And the council ended up supporting using sworn. But now I'm hearing, well, we have so much work for our firefighters and my preference is to have firefighters focused on fighting fires and not necessarily doing inspections. So if we're going to consider adding a position or somehow making this move that is expensive, I think I would like us\nSpeaker 0: to also look at relook at, reconsider or not just the sworn versus non sworn inspections, but what else we can do to effectively, um, efficiently and effectively utilize our firefighters. A member.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to just refresh everyone's memory. That Chief Long, when he was here, did ask for a fire marshal position, and that was turned down. So that was part of his original plan. And there was a big expos\u00e9 in the I think it was the Mercury News, including Oakland, our neighbor, which had\nSpeaker 2: the ghost ship. You know, and they're they're doing this with non sworn and they're just not getting the job done. So all of their residents are at risk. So I'm not willing to take that risk with the safety of the residents of Alameda.\nSpeaker 2: But like Oakland did. But, you know, that's kind of a history lesson.\nSpeaker 0: Member matters.\nSpeaker 6: I do think it's worth having this come back. And I'd also like to know this is the first time I've spoken and I'm down to 8 minutes.\nSpeaker 2: How does someone got my time?\nSpeaker 6: But I think I think this is an important enough issue to. Have I and I agree with Ms.. Adair, approve the budget and have it come back when we have some real numbers on what's happening and then what the consequences of not having this and what the other options are.\nSpeaker 0: Did you want to know?\nSpeaker 5: Okay. I'll hold mine for nothing.\nSpeaker 4: Well, I just want to, if you don't mind, Madam Chair, if we could just. I just want to make sure that we have content, that we have three, that. That want us to come back and do that. That is going to be a fair amount of work and we're happy to do it.\nSpeaker 4: I just want to make sure that that's a consensus that I can also.\nSpeaker 5: What is the that that we're.\nSpeaker 4: Well, I think that that we're coming back to look at other ways to pay for the fire marshal and then also the non sworn issue that mayor.\nSpeaker 6: I thought that was the direction out of the workshop because the chief presented just an ass with a promise that there would be money behind it and that was insufficient.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. And and then the nonsupport issue.\nSpeaker 6: Well well, I think I think that we leave to the chief's imagination it's cheaper. And if you've got a budget that's this big and you need to squeeze your work into that budget, come back to us with something that's cheaper, that fits in.\nSpeaker 2: I don't support that, though.\nSpeaker 0: Remember, I.\nSpeaker 5: Said the point I was making was indeed following up with the chief on the impressive list of projected revenue sources starting as early as July 1st. Because the representation that's been made to me is that this position, including the PERS aspect of it, would be funded into perpetuity by these revenue sources.\nSpeaker 5: So that's why I need to see I need to see some real, real numbers and we just don't have those yet. And with regard to the sworn non sworn you're right, whoever said it, that is it becomes a union issue.\nSpeaker 5: It's up to the chief and his his staff to to decide how to allocate their resources. But this position, as I understand it is, would be to supervise that fire prevention bureau that we created. But as I also explained, there's a lot of importance and value in having a balanced budget right now.\nSpeaker 5: And it's just a matter of let's see those numbers if if you can show us that that indeed that position is is funded by by the by these revenue increases, then, you know, I'm ready to support it, but it's just premature at this time.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. I think that's that's sufficient. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. They continue.\nSpeaker 3: Their key.\nSpeaker 8: So once we go back to the slide, I was ready to move on, but I'm open if you have any additional questions about it.\nSpeaker 0: Any questions? All right. So they continue.\nSpeaker 8: All right. Moving on. So here's a snapshot for the Midcycle projection one more time. And our expectation, again, projection. And the expectation is that we will and the baseline operations or the operations in this case, which includes the requests that you just seen, and this is general funds specifically, it will give us an annual deficit of $8,000\nSpeaker 8: . And to be perfectly honest, this could have been a rounding and you could probably say that we're breaking even, but that's how the numbers fell out. So this is our best guess, best estimate on the budget, and that's where we expect to be at this point.\nSpeaker 8: We're still meeting projecting to meet 25% operating reserve. And we still have, as we mentioned before, the surplus to set aside funds for the pension and OPEB under the policy. So this is just a snapshot in the graph form as to where we will be.\nSpeaker 8: Instead of looking at the numbers and the lines for us, the revenue and expenditures meet and that's a positive thing. And to go back a little bit, just to confirm, to show you really the comparison, originally a year ago when you adopted the budget, we were thinking we were going to be $2.9 million in a deficit for\nSpeaker 8: the year. We actually had a swing of almost $3 million and it actually got us to a -$8,000. So I think that's a big takeaway from here.\nSpeaker 0: Can you go back to the page, the page that had the deficit or actually maybe it's up here.\nSpeaker 3: Here.\nSpeaker 0: Actually, I don't think it was I think it was 24.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Maybe.\nSpeaker 8: I'm not sure if we move on for the general fund forecast. So I'm anticipating the question is going to be there. Here's the representation of how we're going to look five years down the road. And if we continue at the current spending level, in the current projection of the revenues in by fiscal year 2122, we're expecting to\nSpeaker 8: have an annual gap of $4.7 million, and that does include the requests that have been made by staff to include in the 1819 budget. Same thing, same presentation, but in a number of format or table format that shows that our net annual activity by the year of fiscal fiscal year 2122 is $4.7 million.\nSpeaker 8: As you see, we start drawing down on our available balance in 1920 by about half a million dollars, but it actually doesn't bring us below our 25% level. It actually happens in fiscal year 21 and 22 is when we actually starting drawing down on the available reserves.\nSpeaker 8: That said, by policy at 25%.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Before you move on, remember matter. I see.\nSpeaker 6: And this project projection is based on doing nothing.\nSpeaker 8: This projection assumes nothing other than what we currently have. Yes.\nSpeaker 6: No corrections.\nSpeaker 8: No, no, no adjustments.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I was on page 20. That's where you first showed the -8000. All right. And that's after our mid-cycle. Everything. Our new request. This is new program requests. Correct. Okay. So that means that our annual activity, our expenses year for the one year are higher than our projected revenues.\nSpeaker 8: By.\nSpeaker 0: 8000 $8,000. Correct. Okay. And then on page 24, we continue doing that, right? Showing our. Expenses expenditures on a yearly basis being higher and our projected revenues.\nSpeaker 8: Yes, our expenditures continue to grow. There are certain factors that unfortunately are out of city's control. We do have revenues that are growing as well. They're just not growing at the same pace.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so in regards to this year and that's back on that page 20, we're actually going to start using as of this year our reserves to cover that 8000 and recover that 8000.\nSpeaker 8: This estimate is $8,000. So assuming we're going to come in exactly as we projected. Yes, we will drawdown $8,000.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then when you go back to page 24. The prior year, we did not have that. We ended up positive by quite a bit, right? Correct. Then at this point, your best estimate then is that we're approximately 8000 negative and then it actually grows projecting year after year starting this year.\nSpeaker 0: You're that based on this this budget has us use our reserves as our projects.\nSpeaker 4: That's correct. But don't forget your. So, for example, that net annual activity in 1718 is close to $5 million. So you don't lose that $5 million that goes to your bottom line. So that -$8,000 is just the difference between your revenues and expenditures.\nSpeaker 4: It's not as impact your reserves. You're still your reserves are still there.\nSpeaker 0: Correct. I want to underscore that our projected budget has our expenses this year more than our projected revenues.\nSpeaker 4: Management, with all due respect, $8,000 is not even nine.\nSpeaker 0: I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 4: I just want to be aware what we call budget doesn't really in a almost $100 million budget. $8,000 is next to nothing. And it's really.\nSpeaker 0: Where the trend continues based on these projections of our annual if we do ventures exceeding our projected annual revenues.\nSpeaker 4: Correct. If we do nothing and as we have mentioned before, this does this budget does not include any future development at sight. It doesn't include any future development on the northern waterfront. It's conservative. There are many things that we can do to make sure that by 2021, we do not have a deficit of $5 million.\nSpeaker 4: This is if we do nothing. So it is a planning document. So your point is well taken. It is a planning document. And we do need to be continue to be conservative and figure out what are we going to do.\nSpeaker 0: But this is also if we accept these mid-cycle budget requests or we don't cut somewhere else. Correct.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, we do have mid-cycle budget requests of $1,000,000. And with that request, we essentially what we would consider and I think I'm not going to put any words in midair is work mouth. But we have a balanced budget this year.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 8: To move on. Revenue assumptions haven't changed. We still have the same revenue assumptions as we did when we presented it to you at the workshop. Same thing for the expenditure assumptions we still have cost of living adjustment medical in.\nSpeaker 8: The biggest one of course is CalPERS growth per year of about 15%. So all of those are the same factors as we presented it to you in May. A similar graph as the mayor actually was showing on her state of the city.\nSpeaker 8: CalPERS. This is the unfunded liability. And I do want to point out on this one as again, with the policy that council adopted and which I think everyone would commend you on the fact that we've put aside funding and we already saved about $1,000,000 on CalPERS payments.\nSpeaker 8: It's huge. And every time we put in $1,000,000, we will save $100,000 for every $1 million. I know it sounds like a lot, but when we have to shave off that curve to preserve our services, I think that's a huge deal when we actually do have an opportunity to do that.\nSpeaker 8: And that's completely because you've approved a policy that helps.\nSpeaker 3: Us do that. Remember, Audie.\nSpeaker 2: Just quickly on that, you know, many times during the month, I get approached by other council members from other cities commending us on that and saying, we're just starting to look at that. And I know they're using this as a model on how they could they could attack their issues as well.\nSpeaker 2: So thank you for that.\nSpeaker 8: That concludes my presentation. And really the next steps are the staff finance approval requests to request council to approve four resolutions. Obviously one is workforce changes and then with the workforce changes that are happening, there is a salary schedule amendments that are in compensation plan, amendments that are requested again done by a resolution.\nSpeaker 8: We also ask you to approve the city budget resolution. And because we do have a successor agency to the Community Improvement Commission, that's a separate resolution that needs to be approved as well.\nSpeaker 0: And we do have one public speaker. So Council, if that's all right, I'm going to go ahead and call Speaker Eric Strimling. And he's the only speaker. If you want to speak on this item, please submit your slip.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I rise today. You have to help me to run this coalition to applaud. And thank you for providing legal assistance to tenants. The lawyers that we have looked up, the pro-bono ones are completely booked for four months and the ones for pay start at $200 an hour and go to 400 pretty quickly.\nSpeaker 2: A tenant who is already paying 40 to 60% of their income in rent simply doesn't have anything like that kind of money. They have no equity lines drawn. They have no ability to deal. So I really mostly just wanted to get up and say thank you very, very much.\nSpeaker 2: We understand that there are some income requirements being asked to push for very low and low end to consider if it's possible to get into moderate and have to look at the budget numbers for that. And I don't understand that 100,000 to start.\nSpeaker 2: It's a three year program with $500,000 and startup costs are usually higher. So you think it would be a little bit front end? There may be very good reasons for that. I just I don't know them well. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: That's mostly what I'm here to say.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Member matter.\nSpeaker 6: I'd like to make a motion to approve and adopt the SES operating budget mid-cycle to approve and adopt the successor agency budget. To approve the resolution for workforce changes and to approve the resolution amending the city of Almaty, ACA salary schedule.\nSpeaker 6: That goes with it.\nSpeaker 5: And I would.\nSpeaker 0: Request that we bifurcate them and do them one at a time. Of doing them all at once.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I'll start off with the first one. Approve and adopt the City Operating Capital Improvement and Capital Budget Mid-Cycle update.\nSpeaker 0: Member.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, I'll second.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Any Council discussions.\nSpeaker 2: I mean. Well, just to raise the point that I raised earlier, but this chicken and egg thing, I think we need to improve the position. I'm okay with not funding the position for the fire marshal, but I think we have to approve the position.\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, without that position in there at least so we can get this ball rolling to actually fund it and have it fully paid for. You know, I'm not ready to support any of these budget motions at this time.\nSpeaker 5: This evolution is.\nSpeaker 0: Any other comments on this? A. So Miss the dare. Maybe it's not even appropriate to call you back up at this time. I'll just wait. I'll go ahead and call the question. All those in favor.\nSpeaker 3: I. I.\nSpeaker 0: Others post. So the budget. Right. That was the motion. Mm hmm. I oppose.\nSpeaker 2: I oppose.\nSpeaker 3: Three.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, so, uh, motion carries right through to two.\nSpeaker 6: I move. Approving and adopting the successor agency and Community Improvement Commission budget fiscal year 1819.\nSpeaker 0: Others is their second.\nSpeaker 5: A second.\nSpeaker 0: All those in favor. I.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 0: I. All this pose.\nSpeaker 2: God, I actually on that one.\nSpeaker 0: So that one carries unanimously.\nSpeaker 6: I'd like to prove that I make a motion to approve the Workforce Change Resolution for a Community Development Department based Resource and Transportation Planning Department. Fire Department. Information Technology.\nSpeaker 3: Part Council.\nSpeaker 0: Comments. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 5: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: That's right. Let me get a second.\nSpeaker 5: For a second.\nSpeaker 0: A rush to a vice mayor.\nSpeaker 7: I think one of the things that we should be looking at and it was raised tonight with all of the changes that are happening to the city as we look at our workforce and the and the continuing changes, changing needs of our community.\nSpeaker 7: Certainly the changes that we have talked about and discussed at the workshop are necessitated by the work and needs of our community. And I think one of those is fire safety and fire prevention, especially with the development that's coming forward.\nSpeaker 7: So I look forward to the work being done by staff and having it brought back to us.\nSpeaker 0: So there's a motion and a second. All those in favor. I. Oppose. I oppose.\nSpeaker 2: Abstain.\nSpeaker 6: So in the last three sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Three in favor, one opposed, one abstain. And I don't know if you caught that. Thank you. Okay. So I opposed and member ody abstained and the rest support it.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I would like to move the amendment to the ACA salary schedule and the salary schedule for me in the compensation plan associated with it.\nSpeaker 7: Second.\nSpeaker 0: Any comments? All those in favor? I suppose so. Four in favor. One opposed. That completes the agenda item. And now we will take a five minute recess. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: We're getting ready to resume. Thank you. And now we're going to be back on Earth. Which one is it? Six feet, six C. All right, we're on six C.\nSpeaker 1: It's a public hearing to consider adoption of a resolution amending Master P, resolution number 1 to 1 nine one to add and revise B, including a rent stabilization program, late fee. And the finance director is returning right now to begin speaking about the master fee, I believe.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 4: There are approximately four, four, six unit use zones designated along our northern waterfront. And one of them in particular is the Alameda Marina complex, which is kind of an example, and I'd like consideration within this direction to look at.\nSpeaker 4: Job retention and business retention within those mixed use zones that have active commercial concerns. That we have guidance on how to accommodate the adjacent state. Tidelands and shoreline uses because a number of at least three of these parcels have state tidelands components.\nSpeaker 4: So establish some guidance or some proportion of commercial use to residential use. And retain or increasing jobs in these zones, particularly in zones that were commercial and active before. As well as those zones, that maybe commercial activity has ceased so that we get a balance when the residential development occurs.\nSpeaker 4: I think the justifications are quite simple. A business retention is essential to the city's economic stability. It offers jobs and generally well-paying jobs occur in in some of these zones. And then maintaining or increasing jobs in Alameda and particularly these zones has the potential to reduce traffic congestion because the person working in that job will either be\nSpeaker 4: following a work reverse commute, which we have capacity for or not leaving the island during the rush hour in the morning on the bridges or the tubes and returning in the same way.\nSpeaker 0: All right, staff, did you want to respond to this at this point? And we have at this point 23 speakers.\nSpeaker 9: Matt Cameron suggested go to the speakers. And then we do have, you know, sort of an outline of how we'd like to address this.\nSpeaker 1: The speakers in a meeting a long time are right.\nSpeaker 0: And the speakers are you. You can have up to 3 minutes. Hopefully you can do it shorter. All right. I appreciate it. But we kept you here just like Peter Brand. Dorothy Freeman and then Joseph Watford. And you can line up here and then Bill Cox.\nSpeaker 5: Right. Thank you. Council members. I am Peter Brand and I'm.\nSpeaker 8: Speaking on behalf of the existing working waterfront.\nSpeaker 5: Out there, an enhancement of that.\nSpeaker 8: And your job tonight is is in some ways easier. Instead of having to correct an awful situation. What your job is, is to preserve and enhance an existing, vital, healthy working waterfront. All right. I have sent you a letter and and I'm not going to read all of those nine policies that I've listed in there.\nSpeaker 8: However, I want to. For your benefit and the people in the audience to let them know that state policies give high priority over residential to recreational and commercial boating use of our shorelines and to reservation of adjoining uplands for boating support facilities.\nSpeaker 8: This is an enlightened and progressive model that's existed for 50 years unchanged. It works for California and it can work for the city of Alameda. And when regulating the coast and Bay Shore, the state of California codes are very clear.\nSpeaker 8: They say they're unequivocal regarding these shoreline dependent uses. They say these uses shall be encouraged, shall be protected, shall not be reduced, shall be preserved, shall have priority, not should, shall have priority, and shall be permitted long term growth.\nSpeaker 8: Now there has been some mention of requirements of the lease that proposed $1.7 million worth of improvements that have to be completed over the 15 year period of that lease. You're only in the fourth year of that, and already about two thirds of that has been completed and paid for.\nSpeaker 8: So that should not be a concern of yours that the the during the course of that lease up to the year 2027, that those improvements to the shoreline can and will be completed. I'd like now to read and I believe.\nSpeaker 5: Somebody is ready to, you know, give me their time.\nSpeaker 8: Brought to lap the former harbormaster is asked me to read a letter to you that he has written. I'm in abbreviated slightly. He refers to the Bay West development proposal in November 2015 for high density housing with examples including 3 to 5 story buildings.\nSpeaker 8: Mr. Abbott says the community should consider what is at risk. Time is short to engage and make your preferences known.\nSpeaker 5: Closure of Swenson's Hall out facility. And I'm sorry, I'm just.\nSpeaker 0: So you know, Patsy there is seating her time to you.\nSpeaker 8: Okay, great. Thank you. Would be a truly immense loss to the.\nSpeaker 5: Recreational boating community of San Francisco Bay.\nSpeaker 8: Swenson's is one of the few remaining boat yards in the bay and allows owners to work on their own boat when hauled out.\nSpeaker 5: Is also one of the top 25% sales tax generators for the city.\nSpeaker 8: Of Alameda. The marina elevator at Swenson's is absolutely essential.\nSpeaker 5: To the maintenance of.\nSpeaker 8: Houseboats docked at Barnhill Marina No viable alternative. The Boatyard and maritime related companies are part of what makes Alameda a unique and vibrant waterfront community. There are numerous marine related businesses on the marina property, many of which have been there for decades.\nSpeaker 8: These companies contribute to the fall services aspect of the marina and are dependent on a watershed side location. Tenants who store their boats on trailers and use the shoreside hoists have no viable alternative location in the East Bay.\nSpeaker 8: No alternative location. What becomes of their ability.\nSpeaker 5: To recreate on the bay and the value of their vessels? The Island Yacht Club is very active recreational facility along the estuary, the clubhouse, the Friday evening races, the annual Women's Sailing Seminar.\nSpeaker 8: Programs for Bay D.\nSpeaker 5: And Sailor Sailors and is home to the Alameda Sea Scouts. Aside from the above impacts, there is the.\nSpeaker 8: Reality of ever increasing population.\nSpeaker 5: Density.\nSpeaker 8: At what point.\nSpeaker 5: Does the impact of development.\nSpeaker 8: Become more important than the value of additional housing.\nSpeaker 5: On the island? So that's the end of Mr. De Laps, the.\nSpeaker 8: Former Harbor Master's letter. Thank you very much, Counsel. And I'm impressed by your public service and you're willing.\nSpeaker 5: To stay so late to consider this matter. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Freeman. Dorothy Freeman.\nSpeaker 4: And Jim is going to be holding us both up.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening. I'm Joseph Woodard and I speak also for Dorothy Freeman. We live one block from the Alameda Marina. I'm not going to talk about the traffic problems that more homes on Clement Avenue will cause. And I'm not going to talk about building more homes.\nSpeaker 5: No one in Alameda will be able to afford, nor am I going to talk about the need for low income housing and that this development will only make a very small dent in what is needed in Alameda. What I will talk about is what we will lose if the marina is developed into condos.\nSpeaker 5: First, the marina is not vacant and underutilized, nor was it in 2012. As the housing element falsely states. The marina is a vibrant business district, mostly maritime related, but other business types are located there as well. The marina is home to the very businesses we are told Alameda needs to bring here.\nSpeaker 5: There are about 60 plus active businesses at the marina. The marina is home to the very jobs, we're told, that we need to bring here quality, high paying jobs. There are about 290 high paying middle class jobs at the marina.\nSpeaker 5: We're told we need to have employment opportunities that will allow the workers to be able to afford to live in Alameda. Many of the business owners and employees at the marina already live in Alameda. The Alameda marina serves activities at the very core of our island water based services.\nSpeaker 5: We do have a sailboat on our flag. Alameda is famous in the Bay Area for our marinas. But the commercial and pleasure boats that makes their make their homes and our marinas are here because of the services that are provided to them.\nSpeaker 5: Our marine services are known throughout the Bay Area and beyond. Unfortunately, these services don't seem to be well known to those in our own city. The services at the marina are all that is left of these facilities. Alameda once had.\nSpeaker 5: If the marina services go away, maritime in Alameda will eventually go away. Also, because water is not enough to sustain an active maritime life, services are needed to maintain the commercial and recreational activities. If the marina jobs go away, we are not protecting what we already have.\nSpeaker 5: We will replace them with the usual retail businesses that are not unique and have wages below what will be needed to live in Alameda. Eventually, our famous marinas will have empty slips or non reparable and unsaleable boats that will be abandoned in our in the estuary.\nSpeaker 5: And an important part of our history and identity will be gone forever. We're going to have to take the boat off our flag.\nSpeaker 0: Wilcox. Wilcox and then George Lefcourt. Then Grant Hayes.\nSpeaker 5: I'll be brief. I have a petition, and you're welcome to copies of it. I know it's late. It's not good reading material. I'm an 18 year resident at Barnhill Marina, and our neighbors who sign this petition are worried that the service facilities that provide the ability to haul our houses out and work on them will go away\nSpeaker 5: if Svensson goes away. Specifically the Marine elevator and the people who know how to use it. We have. I believe for houses that need that service right now, but don't have the ability to get in line to use it.\nSpeaker 5: So it's a vital thing. The value of our houses, our ability to live in them and stay dry are at stake and there is no place else. We're researching vigorously, but there's no place else in the East Bay that we can take them to to haul them out.\nSpeaker 5: So please do what you can to keep that service available.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks. Thank you. George Lakoff. Grant Hays and then Nancy Hurd.\nSpeaker 8: Madam Chair, vice chair and council members.\nSpeaker 5: My name is George Lithgow.\nSpeaker 8: I'm a sailor. I've been sailing out of.\nSpeaker 5: Alameda Marina for 32 years. I won't go into.\nSpeaker 8: Details that when my maternal grandfather, grandmother emigrated from the Cape Verde Islands.\nSpeaker 5: In 1907. My mother was born on this island. I have been I worked on this island at the Naval Air Station. I say a lot of this island. I teach blind sailors out of this island. The what happened.\nSpeaker 5: One of the things you have when you have an island, you're surrounded by water. Your coast is your asset. The minute you lose that coastline to housing and there there are access to a coastline is a path, a ten foot wide path that you can walk along with.\nSpeaker 8: A concrete wall or maybe rip wrap to keep you from falling in the water.\nSpeaker 5: But you don't have access to water like you have. If you have a boat and you can put your boat in the water and you take people sailing, you come back from sailing. We have looe. If we lose this asset, we have lost part of the heritage and you know the heritage and history of Alameda in the\nSpeaker 5: maritime world that the Kaisers ship docks fishermen years ago Neptune Beach. It's this almost to me as silly as a developer coming up to you and saying, we want to we want to pave Crown Beach, but houses on it.\nSpeaker 5: And you'd say, why do that? Alameda Marina is used every day by people. It's a different community. And you may not be sailors, but we have a sailing community. And to destroy that would be destroying, I think, part of the essence of what Alameda is.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Grant Hays.\nSpeaker 5: Mayor Spencer, Honorable Council Members. I've been a resident of Alameda now for 20 years. I'm a boat owner and I'm a father of a very active junior sailor in Alameda. As a longtime resident, I've seen many changes in Alameda.\nSpeaker 5: A lot of it has been very progressive. I'm not opposed to the progress that we've made, but.\nSpeaker 4: I am getting clearly concerned regarding the scale of change happening in Alameda.\nSpeaker 5: With regard to the aluminum arena and the change to mixed use permitting or housing. I basically have three serious concerns. One is the density of 400 houses in Alameda is only going to contribute to an already severe traffic problem getting on and off the island.\nSpeaker 5: The other is the planned rezoning. It effectively eliminates the boat.\nSpeaker 4: Yard and all the maritime and.\nSpeaker 5: Commercial jobs in that area for mixed use jobs. And I would like to just say mixed use versus a skilled machinist. There's a big.\nSpeaker 4: Difference in terms of income.\nSpeaker 5: There. And then the third is basically as a concerned voter, I, too, am a boater.\nSpeaker 4: I know Jorge. I know everybody within that Alameda Marina community.\nSpeaker 5: I worry about the long term outlook of the boat slips. I know under the current.\nSpeaker 4: Plan they're going to.\nSpeaker 5: Be accommodated for now. But I also very much worry about the dry storage boats. While I completely understand the need for more housing, there's obviously a housing crisis. I believe 400.\nSpeaker 4: Units is simply too much. And that is going to contribute to the once again, the very serious traffic problem that we have to think that there won't be an additional 400 to 500 cars on Clement every morning and afternoon.\nSpeaker 4: I think is.\nSpeaker 5: It's.\nSpeaker 4: Just unrealistic. And the other thing, of course, is the.\nSpeaker 5: Loss of the boatyard. Those are.\nSpeaker 4: High paying, good jobs within the boatyard, in the commercial commercial community.\nSpeaker 5: In that area. Those are sustainable. The Alameda. And then finally, as an avid boat boat owner, I really am.\nSpeaker 4: Concerned about the long term boating community here in Alameda with the.\nSpeaker 5: Loss of another boat yard. It really will become inaccessible in the bay area. Don't on a boat.\nSpeaker 4: Right now we if we lose suspensions, we only have one major boat yard in all of the Bay Area.\nSpeaker 5: Otherwise, it's just small boat yards. Finally, I'll just close with saying Alameda with its many yacht clubs.\nSpeaker 4: We have the Sea Scouts, we have two junior sailing programs.\nSpeaker 5: We have a long maritime.\nSpeaker 4: History that I think we should.\nSpeaker 5: Really, really defend here. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Nancy Hurd and then Tom Mueller.\nSpeaker 1: I asked for.\nSpeaker 9: Can you put in my map? Oh. There. Okay. I have. I've provided a map for you of the Alameda Marina, and I wish it was turned the other way, but unfortunately it's not. But you can see, what I want to point out is the area that's in green at the bottom of this is the one area of\nSpeaker 9: the marina that does not have boats on it. Everything else has boats. And the developer recently had an in the in the Alameda Sun I think also in the journal. Thank you. That's great. The developer had said, oh, he would give 75,000 square feet to to the boating community and we could still have, you know, a marina\nSpeaker 9: and we could still have some maritime services, 75,000 square feet. That would be a very small amount in this total whole scheme.\nSpeaker 0: Where everywhere you look with the red.\nSpeaker 9: Lines is currently boats. The city right now has suggested that, well, maybe it's just part of it, the central.\nSpeaker 0: Part where you.\nSpeaker 9: See the black hash lines that's crossed by.\nSpeaker 0: My red grass line lines.\nSpeaker 9: Those. That's the area that the planning department has suggested might be what the compromise would be. Look at all the other areas around there that would not have there wouldn't be space for all those boats. The dry storage is really important and all these boats are dry storage.\nSpeaker 9: The buildings that I have outlined in blue are the ones that are the marina maritime oriented buildings. There's a little small building that half of it you'll see towards at the, I think, Chestnut Street. And there's a little pink mark that actually has an apartment in it.\nSpeaker 9: So there's housing in this in here already. So, sir, I want you really to think about the magnitude of how many boats we have in Alameda Marina. And going down to 75,000 square feet is not even feasible to meet the.\nSpeaker 0: Needs.\nSpeaker 9: Of the sailors in their community. As far as the the the businesses. You know, we do have these maritime businesses, which many other people have talked about. But the other businesses in here are just as important. We've got businesses that work together.\nSpeaker 9: There's a printer in there. They take the printer, takes care of the printing for all the other businesses there. There's a golf shop that's a that's a recreational thing. There's a there's a hot rod shop. There's lots of businesses where people are earning money there.\nSpeaker 9: You know, most of them are aluminum's. They're making good, good pay because they're skilled. There's also a lot of professional jobs in these buildings and they also are people.\nSpeaker 0: Michaelle said that she would cede her time to you.\nSpeaker 9: Oh, thank you.\nSpeaker 0: So let me.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Amy. So what you know, what we would like to propose is there's not a contraction, but more of an expansion of the commercial, possibly some retail. This is very close to the freeways it would bring. People could come and we can make this a destination.\nSpeaker 9: There's there's lots of opportunities, maybe in the green area where you could put more commercial enterprises that would bring shoppers and make it a unique shopping area. You could make some of these areas, recreational areas. There could be some sort of a museum that gives heart, gives people information about our Marine, our maritime past and our history\nSpeaker 9: . This this the shipyard goes back to the 1880s. It originally started with when they were building ships in the marshes, and they were building ships for the South Sea trades. The during World War Two, they made parts for the boats and then they put them in the parts that they made in the in the boats that then\nSpeaker 9: went off. And the ships, rather, they went off and sailed to to win World War Two. So there's a lot of history here. And another thing that may not be very well known to people is because of the in the amount of buildings in this space that are intact, this is eligible for then the national lists of\nSpeaker 9: historic places. And if we start taking out these buildings, then we start taking away what could be another honor in almeida's already wonderful historical resource. So all these things combined for for for anybody to take to take away any of these buildings is just like it's really going to do a big disservice to our community.\nSpeaker 9: And as other people said, you know, if we lose this maritime operation here, we've lost a big, big part of Alameda. Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. Paul Miller.\nSpeaker 0: Paul Miller and then Andy McKinley.\nSpeaker 5: I sort of abided by the term dry storage. It sort of implies like the boats are there to be stored. They're not. Some are. I mean, next to my boat for a while, there was one boat that was stored on a freighter.\nSpeaker 5: It could never be moved, could never float. I have no idea why the guy had it, but that's rare. If you look at the boats and go through the marina, I've done that for 25, 30 years and walk all around.\nSpeaker 8: You're going to find most of them are used, not most of them, but a good half of them are used avidly.\nSpeaker 5: The boats in the water.\nSpeaker 8: Don't do any better. Half of them sit there and nobody uses them. But then there's a bunch that are used avidly. You want to see the boats that are used avidly just come down Sunday.\nSpeaker 5: Today.\nSpeaker 8: This Sunday there's a be a can race at the Alameda Marina. And you can see.\nSpeaker 5: The key Korean boats lined up to go in and go out. It's sort of a great pleasure to do that. And putting boats in, it's easy. Boats for the last hundred years have been designed. There's been a group of middle class, modest sized boats that have been designed not to sit in the water, but to sit on\nSpeaker 5: trailers. That's I see a picture in the Anthony Yacht Club of the old club back in 1900 as 1920, maybe it was. And you still see them hauling boats out. These are 22 foot style sailboats and dropping them.\nSpeaker 5: You see in the pictures the old people looking like it's like the 19th century and they're dropping the boats onto trailers, which they probably ran off the pier to, to, to, to park them. Parked boats are not stored.\nSpeaker 5: It's just another way of having a boat. It's not. It's something. And it's I've had a pocket boat like this for years. I love it. It's nice. Small boats that were built to put on trailers at a rate in the Alameda in the estuary.\nSpeaker 5: They they're the most fun to sail in the estuary. I mean, if you if we can't have them any more because there's no room on land, you're going to have to get a giant boat to a big boat.\nSpeaker 5: For me, a big boats, 35 foot or 30 foot, a bigger I have an 18 foot boat that's on the trailer. And you know, your tack, you're talking about destroying what is not a specific niche of sailing because they're going to leave the boats in the water.\nSpeaker 5: That's the plan. They're not getting rid of them. That's the niche. The group that's going to be meshed is us with the dry sailboats and we say dry sailing. We don't say dry storage. And when we said these drinks, the dry sailboats go, you're going to have much less sailing for a middle class, working class people I\nSpeaker 5: mean in sailing will be just looking at the American Cups from were from big yachts. That's nonsense. This is would be a terrible mistake to lose that sprawling mess of sailboats you're going to see when you take it to it they're making.\nSpeaker 0: Andrew McKinley. Andy McKinley and then Dan Goldfield.\nSpeaker 8: Not used to speaking in front of people. So just pretend I'm in my underwear. We're kind of getting off track here. The before the council tonight, you have a revision suggestion and we wanted to provide guidance for accommodating state tidelands and shorelines shorelines as a geological feature.\nSpeaker 8: It's something that doesn't. You can't pick it up and move it somewhere else. You're not going to build an elementary school next to a. Active volcano. You're not going to build a marina next to. The pyramids in Egypt.\nSpeaker 8: It just doesn't work that way. We have the very fortunate. Position of having this marina in our whole northern waterfront is on a channel that is maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers historically pleasure, craft, pleasure, marinas, where the areas were dredged out, especially the bay is particularly bad about infill or silting in.\nSpeaker 8: The Corps of Engineers used to dredge places like St Landrum Marina, which I'm sure you're familiar with, is about to close down because boats can't get in and out of Marina, unfortunately. And Alameda has depths ranging from eight to.\nSpeaker 8: Five feet to get out of the marina into the bay for hundreds of yards that will no longer be dredged by four of engineers. However, this estuary is a commercial channel used by the Coast Guard. In the foreseeable future, this is not going to change.\nSpeaker 8: The Corps of Engineers will always maintain that channel as long as that commercial usability remains. And I don't see the Coast Guard base going away anytime soon. We're talking about ships out there and ships that draw, which means that they are underwater.\nSpeaker 8: Submerge Think of an iceberg somewhere between 25 to 35 or 40 feet. I believe the dredged channel is maintained between 40 and 50 feet, 40 and 53 feet. That if you look at a chart, unfortunately, I don't have a picture for you that I can show you.\nSpeaker 8: The dredge line. The channel. Goes right up to the end of the docks in Alameda Marina. They're right on that channel marker. So that is always the same with Grand Marina and to some degree, Fortman Arena. That channel comes right up.\nSpeaker 8: It's actually closer to Grant to Alameda Marina than it is to the Coast Guard base. So that channel is going to stay open. We have this unique area that we can bring boats in as they get larger and larger and have greater drafts, which means that they're deeper in the water.\nSpeaker 8: Mega-Yacht There's the opportunity for building a marina in a place by Wind River that could be used for those. But that deep water is important. It's something that is given to us that we just we can't let that go.\nSpeaker 8: It needs to be. Kept for boating and waterfront use. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. And Maggie's next.\nSpeaker 5: Honorable Mayor Spencer and esteemed Council members. Thank you for.\nSpeaker 4: Staying here so late.\nSpeaker 5: I come to you today against the development on the Command Street property that we're talking about. I come not only as a student of Aikido, but also as a parent of students of Aikido and as an Alameda math teacher.\nSpeaker 5: I teach at Island High School. Among the many businesses nestled at this place, Alameda Ikigai has an established dojo. Aikido is a noncompetitive martial art and is the only such dojo on the island. For the last 15 years, Alameda Ikigai has trained hundreds of children and adults.\nSpeaker 5: The training focuses on developing the mind, body and spirit. The emphasis on awareness and engagement helps students young and old, with becoming more grounded and responsible community members. In the years I've been involved with Alameda Psychic, I've seen many young children start and develop self-control and confidence.\nSpeaker 5: Our students are not bullied, nor do they become bullies. There are kido mind and body helps them improve their schoolwork and athletics, as many of the parents have noted over the years. We have students from Anson, Ojai, Alameda High Schools, as well as nearly every junior high and elementary school on the island.\nSpeaker 5: As a student of Aikido, I feel empowered with the confidence to intervene in a nonviolent ways to resolve conflicts. As I know, I can both defend myself while keeping others safe. As a parent, I've seen dramatic improvements for both of my daughters in their behavior and in their schoolwork.\nSpeaker 5: As a math teacher, I use Aikido daily in inspiring my students to do their best by redirecting their negative energy into productive energy. This dojo is a locate. The Dojo location in space on comment is an important not just for Aikido practitioners but for Alameda.\nSpeaker 5: In the rush to increase density and create locations to put people. I urge you to consider what will those people do? People need to do more than just eat, sleep and shop. Aikido is an essential service to Alameda.\nSpeaker 5: Moreover, Alameda has been recognized as a northern elite school and as a premier dojo in North America. Sponsoring seminars periodically. These seminars brings people to Alameda from all parts of the United States and from abroad. These people stay and eat in Alameda, thereby helping Alameda economy.\nSpeaker 5: Developed. Developing the location on Cl\u00e9ment would force the dojo to close. Move out of Alameda. Downsize their space or raise dues. All of those options would be a loss for Alameda. Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Maggie Savitch and then Ken Petersen.\nSpeaker 9: But evening, mayor. City Council members. My name is Maggie Savitch, and I.\nSpeaker 6: Represent the Pacific Inter-Club Yacht Association.\nSpeaker 9: Which is an organization composed of 106 Bay Area Yacht Clubs. We are also the parent.\nSpeaker 6: Organization.\nSpeaker 0: Of Recreational.\nSpeaker 9: Boaters of California, which protects the rights of boaters. Since 1968, actually, the Pacific Inter-Club Yacht.\nSpeaker 6: Association.\nSpeaker 9: Began with five Bay Area Yacht Clubs in 1896. We are very concerned about the loss.\nSpeaker 0: Of the resources.\nSpeaker 9: Provided.\nSpeaker 0: At the Alameda Marina. They are the only resources available.\nSpeaker 9: As others have said, other than one other yacht hauling out facility in the Bay Area. What is happening here is that development.\nSpeaker 6: Is paving over.\nSpeaker 9: Coastal.\nSpeaker 0: Resources.\nSpeaker 9: For the boaters of California. It's paving over the coastal resources for the everyday guy, gal, kid. And somewhere somebody has to stand up and say, Enough. I know you need housing. California is unfortunately a victim.\nSpeaker 6: Of its own success.\nSpeaker 7: As far as technology.\nSpeaker 9: Is concerned. But technology also demands fun. Boating. People's access to the coast. People's access to jobs that serve the boating community. And it really is up.\nSpeaker 0: To all of you.\nSpeaker 9: Sitting there in front of.\nSpeaker 6: Us this evening.\nSpeaker 9: And we ask.\nSpeaker 0: You.\nSpeaker 9: To please provide this historical resource not only for the use of voters, but for the history.\nSpeaker 6: And tradition of Alameda.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. And here we see.\nSpeaker 0: Ken Peterson left. All right, the net, Lee. And then Matt Lang or our ski. Evening.\nSpeaker 9: First, I just want to thank.\nSpeaker 0: Mary Spencer and.\nSpeaker 6: Council members Ashcraft they so again for the vote that you took in on the rent ordinance and the moratorium tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: It's clear there are many.\nSpeaker 9: Boating enthusiasts here in Alameda. However, I am concerned that if this referral seeks to change the multi-family overlay zone that was so.\nSpeaker 6: Crucial.\nSpeaker 9: To the state approval of the housing element, then I would oppose that change. And I think it's very important to recognize that Alameda does need housing and and you have recognized that as well. Hopefully some of the voting can be preserved, but there is clearly a need for housing.\nSpeaker 9: So please keep the multifamily overlay soon as is. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Matt. And Liz Taylor.\nSpeaker 5: Good. Late evening. I'm here to talk about as a father of the Aikido Dojo, Clement Street, I have two children, age nine, daughter and age five, who are both in Aikido. They attend three days a week. The acquittal since they have started have learned discipline in the space that is used.\nSpeaker 5: There is perfect space for the amount of students, which is several students and adults who benefit from Aikido. I do not see the point of having more retail stores when there's already Park Street, Webster Street in very large development on Webster Street near the Tube and also South Shore.\nSpeaker 5: So having retail place there and also a million and a half million dollar houses that a majority of the people cannot even afford. I do not find that beneficial. And it also, I think the uniqueness of Alameda since I've lived here, part of it will be lost if retail stores are put there and houses that most people\nSpeaker 5: cannot afford. So thank you for listening.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Liz Taylor. And someone is sitting there talking to you.\nSpeaker 6: Oh.\nSpeaker 0: Ryan's. Go ahead. And then Amy Rose. After you.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Thank you, Mayor and City Council. We've heard a lot of commentary already, and I think the value of the marina from its historic aspects have been covered as well as the the boating community. But I also like to talk about some of the synergy between the businesses that are there now and the other places on\nSpeaker 6: the island. There's a great deal of synergy that goes on between other maritime businesses, for instance, with bay ship and yacht, with West Marine, with ones that are on and off the island all around the Bay Area. Some of the sail makers are world renowned.\nSpeaker 6: People come from New Zealand and Australia to buy sails in Alameda. There are just a myriad of businesses there that are just critical worldwide. We're being in being pushed all the time to increase the blue economy, to increase exports with the new Pacific Trade Agreement coming online.\nSpeaker 6: We need to have maker spaces, manufacturing, light industry that we can create exported products to send these things overseas and to bolster our own economy. There's so much more that we could do as a city to promote these kinds of light industries and things that are made here in the United States for export.\nSpeaker 6: The Army and Marine is a great example of that. Many of the businesses there are actively exporting things all around the world and attracting new business relationships as a result. So I know time is tight, so I'll just stop there and hope that you will do what you can to preserve the marina and businesses that are there\nSpeaker 6: and look at all the relationships as a intermingle across the island. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Amy Rose. And then Peter Butler.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you for the chance to speak. I own a Victorian a half block from the marina and I'm speaking on behalf of some neighbors. I'm also co-owner of a sailboat, and we've heard today about how much Alameda is a sailing and boating town.\nSpeaker 9: It's got six yacht clubs. I'm a member of.\nSpeaker 0: One of them.\nSpeaker 9: We admire the pretty billowing sails and the colorful houseboats and the fun power boats. But do we support the Marine community or do we start driving them away? Do we bulldoze these historic.\nSpeaker 0: Buildings and.\nSpeaker 9: Marine services and all types of other businesses there and replace them with condos and coffee shops? Will the view from my house for my street change from the sailboat masts and the Oakland hills to a five story multi-unit building?\nSpeaker 9: Well, they are parked in front of my house. I support jobs and not condos. I have friends who work at the Alameda Marina.\nSpeaker 6: There's going to be housing built.\nSpeaker 9: Down Clements on and on both sides of the Alameda Yacht Club, on the base and everywhere there's vacant land. I want to commend this letter to the editor from the Alameda Journal by Mark Greenside Reasons to Rezone the Marina and Arsenal and Ship Ways Properties.\nSpeaker 9: It's got nine big reasons for why to take the residential out of the plan and build the residential elsewhere. Economic Diversity. It looks like we will already have planned the number.\nSpeaker 6: Of market rate.\nSpeaker 9: Housing that we want to have by 2023. We've already identified it. Most of almost all the housing in this development would be market and moderate priced. It's not needed to satisfy the housing element. Also, the skilled jobs we've heard about and the gridlock that this will contribute to the the possibility of an earthquake that would.\nSpeaker 0: Really make that.\nSpeaker 9: About seeing the rising sea level. Did we want to build this much right.\nSpeaker 6: Next to the water?\nSpeaker 0: Hazardous waste on the side that needs to be cleaned up.\nSpeaker 9: Drinking water, public land and smart growth. So as I talk to the sailors around Alameda, they all think that this is a done deal. They're all going, oh, too bad about Alameda Marina. We heard about it. Where are we going to take our sailboats to be worked on?\nSpeaker 9: And it's not a done deal. And I hope that the Council will consider Mr. Matter Mallory's proposal.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Peter Butler. And then right around.\nSpeaker 5: Mr. Spencer. Council members, thanks for the opportunity to talk about this. I think it's an important issue. My name is Peter Butler. I lived in Alameda since 1998 and I've had at least one boat in the Alameda Marina the entire time.\nSpeaker 5: When I first moved here, I kept my hobby cat on a trailer in the mail. Mary's dry storage. It was easy to trailer across town. Launched behind the high school. Or take it off the island and go anywhere.\nSpeaker 5: Anywhere around the bay. My wife and I had our second date on that boat and we launched it at the Grand St Marine at the foot of the Grand Street for the Grand St there. Over the years, we've graduated to larger sailboats.\nSpeaker 5: We now have a very nice 30 footer that we keep in the water at the Alameda Arena. Easy access to our boat is one of the reasons we've stayed in the Alameda Marina. When we take friends sailing, there's room for them to park.\nSpeaker 5: It's a short walk and with everyone's gear to the boat. And if I have something heavy to move, I can back my car up to the end of the dock. And because these things are possible, I'm able to keep my boat in great shape and ensure the safety of my family and friends.\nSpeaker 5: There's no other marina on the island where I can do this. But just as important as the easy access is the fact that over the years I've had excellent service from the businesses in the Alameda Marina, particularly Fenton's boatyard.\nSpeaker 5: That's where I get my boat hauled and painted my engine and prop serviced, my rigging built and repaired. I buy parts and supplies at the chancery. And I use their metal workshop and things break from time to time.\nSpeaker 5: They employ excellent craftsmen and I've come to rely on their skill and knowledge. Lastly, I do a lot of work myself because Fenton's will actually let me work on my own boat. This is what we talk about. Well, this is what we mean when we talk about a working waterfront.\nSpeaker 5: And as a long time resident, I recognize the value of this unique asset. I'm opposed to any plan which risks this for the sake of a bunch of condominiums.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Dwight Grant and then Irma, Maureen Nolan and then Andy McKee.\nSpeaker 8: Hello, council members. My name is Dwight Durant. I come representing Club Natick and Club Natick is a yacht charter business on the other side of the island over in Bowling Alley Marina. For the last 35 years, Club Natick has made its home in Alameda.\nSpeaker 8: And prior to that, my father and his father also owned and ran businesses related to the maritime industry in Alameda or on the estuary. All of our businesses have relied on the services provided by Alameda Marina to be successful and provide jobs for Alameda NS and for people who serve the sailors and maritime enterprise people.\nSpeaker 8: The other reason I go to too, Clement Street is because I'm also a member of the Naval Reserve. I came back to Alameda to participate in the maritime industry here after serving on active duty for many years. So it's very important to me that that waterfront continue its tradition of providing a reference point for the maritime industry\nSpeaker 8: , both both militarily and as an industry. That's extremely important to me. My father also served and reported to the Reserve Center there. Club, now teak provides a number of avenues for people to access maritime the maritime industry. We have the largest school in the Bay Area and we have the largest pleasure fleet of charter craft available for\nSpeaker 8: we have over 1500 members, which means that members are coming from all over the Bay Area and in fact all over the country to come to Alameda to charter boats and start their vacations. That's tourism dollars that are coming here behind me.\nSpeaker 8: There are many craftsmen and craftspeople who perform work on the boats that that club not take has in has here in Alameda. And a lot of those industry, a lot of those craftspeople perform their work on our boats when we take them to Swenson's take to get work performed.\nSpeaker 8: We bring our boats from our other base in Sausalito to Alameda to have work done here because we prefer suspensions and the and the other services that are available in Alameda Marina to the alternate boatyard. Of the hundreds of jobs that we have provided that my family has has consistently been able to find craftspeople, tradespeople, yachtsmen and\nSpeaker 8: yachts, women who are able to fill the tasks and jobs that we need in order to run successful business. Alameda has always been able to provide those because of its maritime industry, and to lose any part of the Alameda Marina complex would be a serious dent in our ability to be competitive in this in the Bay Area\nSpeaker 8: and would almost certainly mean that a ripple effect happens when you lose Alameda marina. The ripple goes outward across the island, across the trades, people who work in that industry. Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Irma. Irma? No. And Irma. And after Irma. Andy McKee.\nSpeaker 9: Mayor Spencer. Council members. Good evening. My name is Irma, Maureen Nolan, and I'm a.\nSpeaker 6: Resident and a homeowner here.\nSpeaker 0: In Alameda. And I also work in Alameda in a marine related business.\nSpeaker 6: Today I come before.\nSpeaker 0: You to urge you to retain the maritime.\nSpeaker 6: Infrastructure.\nSpeaker 0: Which is a key part. In the voting.\nSpeaker 1: Industry here in Alameda.\nSpeaker 0: The boatyard in the maritime.\nSpeaker 6: And the maritime related companies are part of what.\nSpeaker 0: Makes.\nSpeaker 6: Our city so unique in a vibrant and waterfront community. In addition to this to this, the proposed 4 to 5 storey housing is too dense and would be. Out of reach of the people that live in Alameda and would only make and would only add to the existing and the alarming traffic problems.\nSpeaker 0: That we are already.\nSpeaker 9: Experiencing. Therefore, I.\nSpeaker 6: Urge you to consider. The implications of the proposed mixed use song project.\nSpeaker 1: At the marina.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. And then the key. And then David Arago HDR Geo.\nSpeaker 5: Mayor Spencer Council, thanks so much for staying so late. I am Andy McKee and I'm an 18 year resident of Alameda. I am not a sailor. I live block and a half from the marina. And it's a part of what I love about.\nSpeaker 3: Being in Alameda.\nSpeaker 5: Is the fact that we have this active marina. What are we.\nSpeaker 3: Replacing? We're putting in tons.\nSpeaker 5: Of houses right now. I do want to mention traffic again because it's a serious problem when a vista we have two huge housing units going in, one almost complete one still in the planning stage. We just had the warehouses knocked down at the.\nSpeaker 3: End of a.\nSpeaker 5: We've got the empty, you know, warehouse across from perforce that's waiting to be filled. We don't even I mean, it's going to be horrible.\nSpeaker 3: The traffic. It's going to happen with all of its housing going in.\nSpeaker 5: And what was there, empty warehouses. They were.\nSpeaker 3: Ugly. They were blights.\nSpeaker 5: Right. They're going to there at least, you know, they're going to fix up the Del Monte. That'll look kind.\nSpeaker 3: Of historic, right?\nSpeaker 5: Well, this the marina.\nSpeaker 3: This is one of the most underutilized, unrealized.\nSpeaker 6: Incredible assets of Alameda.\nSpeaker 5: As had been so eloquently noted right by everybody. Liz Taylor, who came up to speak in front of you, I don't know if she mentioned that she's a co-owner of Tour Marine. They built. Have you guys.\nSpeaker 6: Been in there?\nSpeaker 5: They built deep sea submersibles, right? I mean, it's like Nova. When you.\nSpeaker 0: Walk into that place.\nSpeaker 6: It is incredible. And it's this little.\nSpeaker 3: Hidden gem in this marina, a.\nSpeaker 5: Block and a half from my house. The outreach that they do to schools scientifically, just just it's incredible. Right on top of this.\nSpeaker 6: Just.\nSpeaker 3: I can't believe it.\nSpeaker 5: This shot to the core that that somebody would want to replace this. It astounds me.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm so thankful, Frank, so thankful that you're bringing this forward.\nSpeaker 5: And, you know, I vote and I think a lot of other people vote. And I think it would be entirely against our our you know, I think about the movie theater, right? Remember the movie theater back? Remember the movie theater?\nSpeaker 5: Everybody. Remember that when it was the roller rink? Remember when it was the, you know, the gym. And now look at the movie theater, right? I love this idea of actually acknowledging.\nSpeaker 3: How incredible this place is with some historic note. I think we need to make more.\nSpeaker 5: Of this.\nSpeaker 3: By highlighting what it is and find some more places.\nSpeaker 5: For housing. And also let's build a bridge or something. We got to do something with the infrastructure in the city. We can't just keep building houses and say, Great, we've got more houses, right? We need to do something.\nSpeaker 5: You guys need to get something to do because it's just not sustainable in this location.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. David and then Tom, your own.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening. My name is David Harrigan. Or more.\nSpeaker 8: Accurately, good.\nSpeaker 5: Morning.\nSpeaker 0: Good morning.\nSpeaker 5: I have a somewhat unique perspective in terms of light industrial use on the island. I've worked on the base for one of the major tenants on the island.\nSpeaker 8: On the point for over ten years. I'm also a recreational boater.\nSpeaker 5: I have had extensive work done at at Swenson's and I also am familiar with almost all of the tenants in the marina are currently. In addition not just to the maritime tenants but also to some of the other light industrial tenants I've heard.\nSpeaker 8: Hot Rod Shop referred to. That's actually a.\nSpeaker 5: Moderately moderate competitor to my company, but we also cooperate across the island. We've collaborated on a number of projects. They build stuff for us. We build stuff for them. It's a it's a dynamic community.\nSpeaker 8: And I think that the.\nSpeaker 5: Loss of the shoreline access and particularly the historic use of that, that is is a very, very great concern, particularly in regards to the state ordinance that that you refer to in your proposal. It is with the loss of this coupled with the loss of Nelson's a few years back.\nSpeaker 5: There is no other out. There is no other resource in the East Bay. You have to go all the way to Richmond to haul your boat. And that's that's just the fact. The the the reality is.\nSpeaker 8: As as referred to in the ordinance, the jobs that would be lost are not low paying jobs.\nSpeaker 5: And and replacing them with $15 an hour retail jobs generously.\nSpeaker 8: Is no comparison to replacing machinists.\nSpeaker 5: That makes upwards of three times that. And I think.\nSpeaker 8: That if you lose the light industrial flavor of the waterfront, you lose quite not just the jobs, but quite a bit of the historical historical use of that. And the historical access of it is provided in the state charter.\nSpeaker 5: And I have a concern with the liability involved in that and subsequent legal action. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Leaving Mayor and council staff. Tom Charron. I've messed around in boats since I was 16 and I'm 72 now, so I've spent a lot of time on the water. I have had a boat or two in Alameda since 1993 and currently have one on the heart.\nSpeaker 5: And I got one on the water. Member of a couple of yacht clubs. I've talked to you before, and I don't think I need to go through all the things that have been said so eloquently by the members of the of your audience here this evening.\nSpeaker 5: But I do want to just bring a couple historic things up since 1993. In 93, there used to be four boatyards in Alameda. Right now, there's only one and a half. Because Gran got cut in half, you know, when you allowed or the planning board allowed those houses to be built there.\nSpeaker 5: So it's down to about half its fans is here. There used to be two Chandlers in our city. There's only one that spends, Charnley spends. It hasn't been said here tonight, but spend his warehouse. He sells and sends maritime equipment around the world and supplies all of the the other boatyards in Sausalito and Cama and Berkley with\nSpeaker 5: with parts and sends parts to boaters around the world. So we have a tremendous resource here. And I would certainly ask you to look hard at what Bill Poland really has up his sleeve. What this council did in 2012, without from what I can understand of the input that you have here tonight when this property was zoned\nSpeaker 5: AMC's. Mixed use and look and ask the staff to look closely at what does our city council want to preserve of the maritime community and its assets and support? Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: So at this time we have two speakers left. If you want to speak on this, please turn in your slips. Gretchen Lipow and then Don Chesney. Good evening.\nSpeaker 6: Council mayor and council members and staff. I'm going to just touch on what is what is the Tidelands Trust. So here's a map. And you may have all seen that. Maybe you haven't, but. Thank. Hmm. As you can see, the Tidelands Trust covers about half of the marina, and the line was fixed in the early 1900s.\nSpeaker 6: And it can't be changed. Within that tidelands, the. The. There's to be no residential. It's just marine activities. It's been expanded to cover environmental, environmental and recreational. Activities. The land in California, the State Lands Commission has jurisdiction over the UN granted tidelands.\nSpeaker 6: The word they used for the non tidelands is uplands. Tidelands in uplands. So and this commission has jurisdiction over the public trust. So basically listening to the speakers and looking at the information that I've had, the. The housing element had 240 housing units on the Alameda Marina.\nSpeaker 6: And I think that's a terrible idea. And I'll tell you why, because if you look at what's coming down on Clement, you've got almost over a thousand housing units all along. Clement with the boat, works with the Clement and Willow with the 2100, Clement with the internal terminals with the Del Monte.\nSpeaker 6: You know, my son in law took his kids to off island for a field trip. He said it took the bus 40 minutes to get off this island and these thousand units haven't been built yet. So I think what we're talking about is a balance between jobs, which the marina has.\nSpeaker 6: You've heard all the previous speakers, I don't have to tell you. And and so jobs and housing. And I think that's what we're talking about here. And that is preserving a very valuable piece of property here on the island.\nSpeaker 6: And as you can see on that map, half of the buildings are in the tidelands and half are in the uplands. And that map I just gave you and also I found that in 1980, 2012, in August, there was a law passed that the the city has to account for all of the money that's raised on the\nSpeaker 6: tidelands area. So that's a new law. All right. So I think that's basically what I'm here to to say is to you get the picture. Preserve alameda marina for what it is. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: And our last.\nSpeaker 0: Speaker at this time, Don. Last chance. Turn in your slips.\nSpeaker 9: Good morning.\nSpeaker 0: Morning.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you for being so generous with your time.\nSpeaker 9: Don Chesney. I am a sailor.\nSpeaker 6: I was fortunate enough to happily fall into the sport in my mid-thirties.\nSpeaker 9: Totally changed my life. I had women that were very generous and took me on and taught me.\nSpeaker 0: When I knew nothing.\nSpeaker 9: And now I get back as I teach women.\nSpeaker 6: So I have an all female crew. I have a J 24. It's a stripped down sailboat that is on the heart.\nSpeaker 9: Which with all that goes away, I will no longer have a boat.\nSpeaker 6: And I only take women well as I'm desperate. But it's just been such a life changing event for me, and I see it happening with my crew. And it would be terrible if that went away. The other thing we do, which George mentioned is Island Yacht Club, which is in the marina, we have the only West Coast\nSpeaker 6: International Line Sailors Regatta. The East Coast has several. We are the only one on the West Coast.\nSpeaker 9: Last time we ran the regatta, we do.\nSpeaker 6: It about every other year. We had what, George six countries represented.\nSpeaker 9: What? Boston. That's in the country. Ha ha.\nSpeaker 6: Ha ha. The bay. Canada. So an. And these are like the.\nSpeaker 9: Bravest people you have ever met in your life. These are mostly adults that have lost their sight as adults and then have their world has opened back up when they sailed.\nSpeaker 6: Because sailing is very intuitive.\nSpeaker 9: My second mentor made me see my.\nSpeaker 6: Eyes closed all the time because he's like, Stop thinking. Work with nature. So the other thing that we do at Island Yacht Club in Alameda is we have once a year women's sailing seminar. It's two days. It's all women teaching.\nSpeaker 6: Only women. The guys are fabulous. They do all the hard work behind the scenes, making sandwiches, setting up tables. So what you guys do? We couldn't do it without the guys. So but again, it's that give back of women being the example for women.\nSpeaker 6: And what I love about it, what saved the whole thing is.\nSpeaker 9: Some of the women come Saturday morning and they are scared to death. They just don't even want to really get on a boat.\nSpeaker 6: But maybe boyfriend made them go or something. By the end of the day, their partners show up and we have fabulous appetizers and the guys can hardly recognize their women because the women are like, Yeah. So it's just a wonderfully empowering thing that I think would be horribly, horribly sad to lose.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All right, Steph.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. And thank you for everybody coming out. Um, this is something that. And staying. Yeah. This is something that we have all been thinking about for a long time. And I know the vice mayor has been thinking about this referral for a long time.\nSpeaker 9: So a couple of things that, as you know, I don't know if the folks in the audience or at home actually understand sort of the referral process. This is not this is not our chance to do a staff report.\nSpeaker 9: This is really a time for council member to ask. And then the council has to direct staff to what they want us to do. But just as a sort of prequel to that, I just want to remind folks maybe in the room who don't know and of course, the council does know that we are taking a tour\nSpeaker 9: of Alameda Marina and all of the Northern Waterfront. And we I say the council and the staff concerned will be taking a tour of Aluminum Marina and all of the northern waterfront on March 11th. From 9 to 1, the we'll be leaving here from city hall, getting on a bus and we've already made arrangements to stop at\nSpeaker 9: Albion. A marina will be there for probably about a half an hour, then won't be moving on and single terminals moving on from there to ship ways and to north housing excuse me, an Alameda landing. So that's number one.\nSpeaker 9: And I think staff felt it was really important for the council to actually go out to the site and actually see the marina, see was what was across the estuary. So that was kind of the idea behind that.\nSpeaker 9: And then after that, what we are envisioning for the council and vice mayor is to probably come back to the council in April. Most like to be the second meeting in April, but if we can do it, the first meeting and I think kind of talk about what we saw, what we toured.\nSpeaker 9: Understand the zoning behind that and listen I think to you all and ask for direction about the northern waterfront in particular the landing. We would like. I think that's.\nSpeaker 1: In Alameda Marina, not Alameda.\nSpeaker 9: Aluminum Marina. That's right. Thank you. I'm getting tired so that that would happen probably in mid-April. And at that point, I think we would expect the council to to give us direction or actually potentially even give the property owners sort of some insight about what you're thinking about for these particular properties as it relates to the zoning\nSpeaker 9: , you have a lot of flexibility in the zoning and and we will talk about that at that council meeting. And so that would be the first time that this would formally come back, and that would be in April.\nSpeaker 9: And then subsequent to that, if depending on how that meeting goes and we can talk about changing the zoning and putting some, what does that look like modifying the zoning? That's a longer process. And I'm not really actually prepared tonight to talk about what that looks like.\nSpeaker 9: But we see that sort of as kind of an outline of how we would like to deal with with this issue, if that's a better able to the council and to the vice mayor. I mean.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. So my intent in listening to considerations was just basically frame the discussion because I think the zoning details and the guidance, there's flexibility built in to zoning for practical reasons. But I'd like us to refine what the goals are of our zoning, particularly in the northern waterfront, particularly where there is existing commercial activity that can be\nSpeaker 4: grown as opposed to other. You mentioned Dennis now terminal where the commercial activity has gone. So what is it that we want to see there on a blank slate versus what is it that we want to keep and grow in other areas?\nSpeaker 4: I also want to include for people's thoughts and considerations. If this goes forward, is other zoning that may happen that's not in place now. And I can think of Taylor Webster, where there's a mixed use project that is being reviewed in the planning board right now.\nSpeaker 4: It's the retail commercial on the ground floor and residence above on a lot that has been vacant or underutilized for for several years now, a blight, essentially. So I want to anticipate that in the discussion, not just the northern waterfront, we do have time if the timeline you suggest is amenable to the council.\nSpeaker 0: Member. Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mayor Spencer, and thank you. Thank you to all you stalwarts who stayed so long. And I appreciate hearing from all of you. I have been out to door. Very impressive. Liz Taylor is doesn't begin she's so humble but she is amazing.\nSpeaker 1: And just a year ago, her company was, I think, awarded the East Bay Innovator's Design Award or Innovation Award in their category from the East Bay Economic Development Alliance. We're very proud to have you in our community and and we want to keep you there.\nSpeaker 1: I also want to just remind people. That. I think we should definitely ask the staff to come back and look at these things with us, everything this former dam says we should do. But I also want to remind folks that nothing is simple.\nSpeaker 1: We always strive to achieve balance. And in this case, I think first and foremost, we need to preserve our maritime businesses. And then just a week ago, Debbie Potter, our economic development director, and the mayor and I were out at the East Bay Economic Development Alliance Innovators Awards for this year.\nSpeaker 1: And another Alameda company went in in one of the categories that the nanotechnologies out in your Mariners Square loop. But anyway the I would actually like to and this goes back to something that is near and dear to the vice mayor when we had an economic development commission.\nSpeaker 1: But these businesses who were there at the meeting, Marina, Liz Taylor, talked about the synergy that they create. They, they work with other maritime businesses, the the blue blue industry. They and and this is a declining industry in the Bay Area.\nSpeaker 1: As more and more of the coastline is is used up, I think they can help us reach out and maybe bring businesses here who they know, who I'm always willing to still businesses from other cities. Oh don't quote me but but you know we have this asset to to offer balanced with the jobs we need to create\nSpeaker 1: . And my priority would be maritime based businesses, because, quite frankly, RV parking can be done anywhere. It doesn't need to be there on the waterfront and a few others might fall into that category. But then also bear in mind that there is a cost to renovating the infrastructure that is Old Wharf.\nSpeaker 1: Some of it is started to be renovated. Not all of it has. Where does that money come from? Some of it comes from development. That doesn't mean we raise the buildings that are there, but it does mean the possibility of smart, mixed use.\nSpeaker 1: Years ago, when I was on the planning board, a very smart woman or my colleague and cook, who's an attorney and a waterfront planner by profession, worked on the San Francisco ferry building, talked a lot about the eyes on the street and that you want activity in your developments all the time, not artificial, you know, barista creating\nSpeaker 1: jobs, that sort of thing. But, you know, condos, we you sat here tonight and you heard about the rents, the the the problem people are having finding affordable housing they can afford. Housing that we build, especially below market rate which some of this this will be helps take some pressure off the housing market.\nSpeaker 1: And I also want you to know, and I think some of you already do know, that those well-paying jobs that you talk about being out there at the marina, I heard from the employers, they have trouble finding workers even for those well-paid jobs because they have a hard time finding affordable places to rent.\nSpeaker 1: So we can't pretend that, you know, this is all one way and not the other. We've got to all work toward solutions. But I very much appreciate you all coming out and helping illustrate for us this very vibrant waterfront that's out there.\nSpeaker 1: But I'm just saying, let's let's make sure that we're preserving our maritime uses, maybe bringing some more there, but also looking at the need for the infrastructure improvements and the need for for more housing carefully planned. I look at this very much as a monopoly board was the way when when Liz Taylor took me up to the\nSpeaker 1: top level at that door and you look out this beautiful view and you could just reach out and touch the Coast Guard ship, you know, and there's a there's a great aerial photograph. Things can be can be moved around and situated.\nSpeaker 1: And we could have a very vibrant, functioning, well maintained space there. So let's keep an open mind. So anyway, I would I would just want the when it goes back to staff to incorporate all of those concerns.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Member Odie.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you everyone for coming out and I appreciate the Vice Mayor bringing this item up for discussion. I'm perfectly fine with the recommendations that our interim city manager put forth a little bit concerned about, you know, having a formulaic approach to zoning.\nSpeaker 2: But what might be another idea on this particular paper that Gretchen LeBeau handed us is that, you know, similar to what we did for packet landing, perhaps we do some sense of the council because I do agree that we need to preserve jobs.\nSpeaker 2: I do agree that we need to preserve. I mean, these jobs, I mean, not just any job. I mean, these particular jobs. And that should be something that, you know, maybe that's something we can do as a sense of a council, sense of the council.\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, has someone has plans to. Develop that that, you know, they keep that as a as a consideration and a priority. But, you know, reflecting what Councilmember Ashcroft said, you know, we we just went through a laborious issue of tenant protection.\nSpeaker 2: And one of the things we do have that's causing that is an artificial constraint on supply. So we have to balance that. And I hope that people will be flexible as we prioritize. You know, saving these jobs, again, not any jobs, these particular jobs in these particular businesses that would be open to creative solutions to also, you\nSpeaker 2: know, fully utilizing the intent of zoning.\nSpeaker 0: Everyday stock.\nSpeaker 3: Well, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for coming out and being so engaged. It's very it's actually very informative and informative, particularly in the sense of when someone was explaining the depth of some of the water and how you can float your boat up and when how that's not readily available in other places.\nSpeaker 3: And that that asset mixed with some of the business infrastructure on the land. How that then is intimately tied to the range of consumers of of maritime services, whether it's for recreational purposes or whether it's for business purposes, so that the industry cluster that's there is so intimately tied.\nSpeaker 3: So it's it's not something that that. Well, I think it's also intimately tied to the area. So that leads me to one of the challenges that we need to think about is, you know, are we talking about mixed, you know, changing their mixed use designation or are we not to be talking about, you know, what must be\nSpeaker 3: done for this site to maintain its character and its history and its economic generating uses? That's the completely different set of discussion. That's more specific. It's more narrow to this area. So, you know, I, I look forward to this discussion.\nSpeaker 3: And, you know, I've listened to and met with people who inform me about things like door and other businesses that are there. And these are the type of jobs that we want. These are the type of uses that we want.\nSpeaker 3: This certainly reflects the character and the history of the city of Alameda, an island after all. Right. So I think this is something that we as a council need to be actively engaged in, looking to do what we must, not what we can, but looking to do what we must to preserve the maritime tradition, the maritime jobs\nSpeaker 3: , the maritime connections that this place has with the residents as well as the businesses. No.\nSpeaker 0: Did you want to make a comment?\nSpeaker 9: I did. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Councilmember Odie just reminded me, I mean, appreciate that we are thinking about coming back to something similar to the meeting we had on Harbor Bay Club, the tennis club. And that was kind of what we were envisioning, at least as a preliminary step.\nSpeaker 9: Um, and having the council kind of. Formerly. Discuss and maybe even Adobe something through maybe a resolution or something like that. Well, we're still kind of. Adding that around. But having the counsel kind of express your feelings about how you what you want to see, particularly on this site and some of the other sites.\nSpeaker 9: But it would be similar to the process that we conducted on the Harbor Bay Club. Several months ago.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So this referral, if I'm reading it correctly, it speaks to a consideration of mixed use throughout the entire city of Alameda as opposed to this site in particular that the speakers were speaking to and his staff's response then in regards to city wide.\nSpeaker 0: Or are we? Is it twofold?\nSpeaker 9: I think we. Well, we are going to do the. The tour of the entire Northern Waterfront. And I think we would like to spend a good amount of time on Aluminum Marina because there is some sense of urgency on this matter.\nSpeaker 9: But I think it can also include and this is we're up for you know, this is up. However, council wants to handle it but it can also be a conversation about and so all terminals. Chip weighs on me.\nSpeaker 9: Landing north, housing all the northern waterfront area. Now North housing is not so dmk's north housing has an R for zoning. But it is on the northern waterfront.\nSpeaker 4: I want me to land in his Amex.\nSpeaker 9: Almeida landing his Amex? That's correct. But north housing. Which is not. It does not. That's in hour for that.\nSpeaker 0: So there's not a project pending currently at the marina. But what is the status of that?\nSpeaker 9: No, we do not have a project. Not. No. No application.\nSpeaker 1: Has even gone to the planning.\nSpeaker 0: Board. Okay. So. I would be agreeable to looking at the mixed use zoning citywide. I think we can do that any time. I am concerned I would have concerns about during a preliminary whatever occurred on in regards to the club.\nSpeaker 0: I think that that's actually. Questionable if we should be expressing an opinion when there's not a project pending. And and I would agree and I would also like more information in regards to what are our current options. Just generally speaking of what happens with mixed use, can we can do we have to do we have to include\nSpeaker 0: housing in mixed use or a certain percentage? Or is it looked at on a project by project basis?\nSpeaker 9: Right. I mean, I don't think we should be answering those questions right now, but I think those are the things that we can come back with you all and have that conversation.\nSpeaker 0: So I would I would want to include that as to what is but is currently you, Kent, what it means currently.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I think that's a fair topic to include you just saying you're saying you want that to be one of the things that stuff look.\nSpeaker 0: Right when this comes back and.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, Madam Mayor, I think that's essential, because if we're looking at how we want the future to go, we have to understand what the rules are today. And we have to see if those rules are adequate for what's happening at this example that's been brought up tonight.\nSpeaker 4: And look at the other examples of mixed use and what might be coming. Again, I mentioned the value of of the project at Webster and Taylor as a mixed use project. So do we is what we. The first question I want answered by this exercise is whether what we have is sufficient.\nSpeaker 4: And then I want to to calibrate that against what is the reality that we're seeing. And the testimony tonight gave us a picture of what's right in front of us. So that's my intention, is to get that get that exercise going.\nSpeaker 4: And I hope I can get support for that.\nSpeaker 0: All right. And then there was a comment that some of these buildings are maybe all are eligible for the national list of historic places. Is that something that the staff would be looking at?\nSpeaker 9: We can take a look at that. I'm sure there's a fairly long lead time on that. But we can you know, we can do a little bit of research on that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 9: I just want to ask.\nSpeaker 6: Sorry.\nSpeaker 1: Just just to follow up on the mayor's concern about what we did on the packet landing zone. I will always defer to the attorneys on the legality of anything we do. But I did think that it was useful for the developer to have a sense of where the council was, because there's no point going down a road\nSpeaker 1: that is then not going to get approval. So again, we'll stay within the the zone of whatever the attorneys tell us. They're very cautious. So I don't think the leaders astray. But I, I think I mean, when I was on the planning board, what applicants used to say is don't make us come back and back and then\nSpeaker 1: go, oh, yeah, no, we don't want to do that. You know, they'd rather a lot of money is invested in putting plans together. So I would defer to the attorneys on that one and decide.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, I think the review of mixed use zoning in general, I think is an important discussion for the citizens of L.A. to have. So, so. So I do see incredible value in that. But having a. But having a particular discussion about this site, too, is something that seems to be really what's what's on people's minds as well\nSpeaker 3: . So that's not that ought not to be lost. But it is important to have the discussion about mixed use zone because the. From, in my opinion, the reality of what's what's coming down the pike when it comes to mixed use projects is that it's basically, I don't know, 99% housing and and one or 5%, you know, jobs\nSpeaker 3: . And sometimes the jobs itself might not be of the caliber that that is replacing the lost jobs. Fortunately, with the side project, though, that's not the case. We do have a great balance of of incredible jobs and housing.\nSpeaker 3: So. So it's not completely the so. But when I look at the northern waterfront, though, that does seem to be the case, though. It's a place where where there are or there was a history and there is still some, you know, valuable, good paying jobs.\nSpeaker 3: But, you know, in that area, the type of mixed use that's been happening, I think for the most part has been housing oriented member.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm hoping at some point someone will make a motion.\nSpeaker 2: So maybe I'll do that. You know, I hear what my my colleagues say, you know, Taylor and Webster, there's no jobs there now because it's a vacant parking lot and sale terminals. There's no jobs there now. So, you know, I don't know, you know, how you replace jobs that don't exist.\nSpeaker 2: But I do have a lot of concerns about the aluminum arena. So what I think I heard was that there seemed to be consensus to go forward with the path that the interim city manager proposed. And I thought I heard you say that included in that April and a workshop type event would be an explanation of the\nSpeaker 2: current zoning. So I think that meets the last round of concerns that we had a stake in on that and.\nSpeaker 9: That's right.\nSpeaker 0: So those that are you making.\nSpeaker 2: A decision emotion or I think staff.\nSpeaker 5: Have.\nSpeaker 0: I'm going to. Go to Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 4: I'd like to move the referral as discussed with the with the timeline and the concerns that were brought up to the council.\nSpeaker 1: Well, for clarification, with the concerns that were raised by all the council members.\nSpeaker 6: Correct.\nSpeaker 4: I think I just said way.\nSpeaker 0: We have a second. All right. All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: I'm all for clapping being done.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Next item. Council communications.\nSpeaker 2: Infant mental health.\nSpeaker 0: I get to.\nSpeaker 2: I have one.\nSpeaker 8: Right.\nSpeaker 2: I think I just want to if you could correct back when I spoke about a B to ten and the measure B B, the votes were 46, not 43.\nSpeaker 5: So 46.\nSpeaker 2: 46. So if you can correct that in the minutes, you know.\nSpeaker 9: That you.\nSpeaker 5: About.\nSpeaker 0: That.\nSpeaker 4: Very much.\nSpeaker 7: Well, I'll correct it.\nSpeaker 2: 46 behind you. Okay.\n",

Let me. Councilmember Pearce let me actually go to staff report and then we'll go to the motion itself. So let me go to.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. This is a hearing about our electric scooter program, a proposed program. And with that, I will turn it over to Craig Beck, our director of Public Works, to walk you through the what we've had in place and what we're proposing for the future.\nSpeaker 10: Craig Thank you, Tom. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the city council. Tonight, staff is providing an update on the E-Scooter pilot program that was implemented this past summer and recommendations for a future program. The information provided tonight is based on research best practices from other jurisdictions, experience gained during the pilot program, and data collected from our participating\nSpeaker 10: vendors. So you may recall that in July of this year we did launch our pilot and we ultimately permitted six different vendors to operate in our city bird, lime, razor, skip, spin and use scooter. Our program detailed the opportunity for each of the vendors to deploy an approved 300 each, so a total of 1800 scooters citywide.\nSpeaker 10: I don't believe we ever hit that total number. I think we count somewhere close to 1000 scooters deployed in the city. We require that the deployment be put in what we're referring to as drop zones. You can see in this slide here that there's a picture of a sidewalk emblem of where the drop zones are located.\nSpeaker 10: We ultimately ended up with about 230 drop zones in the city. Each one of them were reviewed. They were proposed by the vendors and reviewed by city staff. We had compliance with path of travel on our sidewalks. The scooters also were required to be deployed excuse me, throughout the city.\nSpeaker 10: And we designated the city within three areas and wanted the fleet to have a minimum of 20% of the deployed fleet in each area. And we thought it was important to give the community an opportunity to weigh in on the E-Scooter program.\nSpeaker 10: So the city paid for a call center where people could call and ask questions, convey concerns, ideas, thoughts, and there was also an email. And so all this data was collected and went into the report that you have before you this evening.\nSpeaker 10: So there are also some e-scooter rules and we wanted to make sure that we were operating a safe program. There's kind of a blend of rules that are required under the California vehicle code and then also the Long Beach Municipal Code and then things that we thought were important for safe scooter use.\nSpeaker 10: First and foremost, we wanted to make sure that somebody was at minimum 18 years of age. That law or that has since changed. And there is a new California law that requires riders to be 21 years of age, that they have valid driver's license.\nSpeaker 10: Certainly, we wanted to encourage safe use of the scooters, you know, driving or riding, rather, on sidewalks. Under law, each municipal code, while we know a lot of this did occur. There is no currently no scooters are allowed to ride on the beach bike path.\nSpeaker 10: We wanted all the riders to wear a helmet. This was also changed recently in the updated law. So that is no longer a requirement, though we believe that it's still important for people to practice safe use and we wanted to make sure that scooters were not parked in a way that that inhibited path of travel on the\nSpeaker 10: sidewalk, as I mentioned. So we did our best to collect data. Unfortunately, we didn't have a lot of compliance from the various vendors who participated, but we did get some reports from the vendors, and so we used those reports and did a little estimating.\nSpeaker 10: So while I don't have firm data to back up what we're presenting, we do believe it's relatively accurate and an important information to share. So from what we can gather, we believe there's roughly. And again, this is for a three month period, August through the end of October.\nSpeaker 10: And we do believe there was roughly 180 or 186,000 rides. So a lot higher than we initially anticipated. And that the average distance was 1.2 miles, which we were pleased to see, because honestly, e-scooters as part of a Micro-Mobility platform should really fill that last mile.\nSpeaker 10: So for example, if you were going to take the blue line into downtown L.A. and you lived within a mile of a station, you could use an e-scooter to take you to that station. And that's called the Last Mile Solution.\nSpeaker 10: We did find that there were citations issued by Long Beach PD roughly 85. From the data we collected, that number may be a little higher. Again, this was for a three month period, mostly for not for riding without a helmet, which is at the time was a requirement.\nSpeaker 10: We also had some data from Long Beach fire regarding EMT responses specific to scooter injuries. Most of them were people who simply fell off the scooters. Either they hit a crack or for some reason stopped too quickly. And they had bumps, scrapes and bruises, a couple of head injuries.\nSpeaker 10: There were some scooters versus vehicles. The data we were able to collect showed that there were about a dozen of those. So the call center. Very interesting information that we got through our call center. Very good. We believe that this was made available.\nSpeaker 10: We did have some community members that that use this very readily. And we tried to to delineate that information as best we could. So when we say 858 unique calls, those were different people calling. And if you look at the type of issues, there was over 744 issues, ideas, complaints that were registered at the call center.\nSpeaker 10: And so we really tried to group those into categories. By far, the biggest one was writing without a helmet. Again, that law has has now been adopted and no longer a requirement, even though staff is recommending that that be part of our program guidelines.\nSpeaker 10: And then writing on the sidewalk and abandoning scooters were elements that that seemed to resonate with concerns expressed through our call center. Staff really wanted to go out and get additional data other than what we were getting at the call center.\nSpeaker 10: So we posted an online survey and were really pleased at the results we had over or close to 2000 responses for a 30 day online survey. Again, this was a public opinion survey. It was not exactly scientific, but we did glean some data from our survey respondents.\nSpeaker 10: 56% of those that responded had not ridden a scooter. So again, the majority of respondents had not ridden a scooter. But we did find that it's when you look at what some of those reasons are, the majority supported scooters as a viable mobility option.\nSpeaker 10: So whether they wrote it or not, they did believe that scooters could fill a mobility gap. And many said that they would ride scooters or consider riding scooters if they felt that it was a safer option for them to do so.\nSpeaker 10: And they also felt that it was a challenge to find scooters in available drop zones so that regular knowing that there will be a scooter at location X was important to those that responded to our online survey. So again, this kind of goes a little bit further into this slide, goes on a little bit further into the\nSpeaker 10: data. And so this is for from generally people who have ridden a scooter. And we wanted to know, okay, you rode a scooter. Why did you write a scooter? And you can see from the pie chart in the middle of this slide that I think going in staff believed that many people would utilize scooters for recreation.\nSpeaker 10: And we did get 32%, but we thought that it would be the majority of rides. And we're really finding from the data that it wasn't that while there are recreational rides, people enjoy going out on a nice day in the summertime and experiencing our fine city and the weather that we have here.\nSpeaker 10: But really, people were using it to replace other modes of transportation walking, driving, bike riding, etc., use of transit. And then that made up the majority of of our riding. So kind of going to the responses from the group that had ever ridden a scooter and that subset.\nSpeaker 10: So 50% said they did not write a scooter. So a subset of them, 43% said that, that that nothing would change their mind, that they are not scooter riders. They don't believe that that's a viable option for them.\nSpeaker 10: And when you do the math and think I did this correctly, so that's roughly 24% of the survey respondents said that they would never ride as a scooter, which again means that almost 75% or so would. And we felt that that number was a much higher than what we anticipated receiving through our survey results.\nSpeaker 10: And then lastly, we wanted to just kind of share with you some of the comments that we received through our online survey, the need for more infrastructure. I think this points to the idea of safety and in our responses people talk about things that are barriers to them and feeling safe on the scooter was one of them\nSpeaker 10: separated bike lanes where they could ride scooters operating in a safe environment, helmets, etc. was important. Comments such as people need to be smarter when using them. And I think this again, it points to consistency with what we saw in the call center, people not wearing a helmet, riding on a sidewalk and not really being fully aware\nSpeaker 10: of their surroundings when they're writing the scooters. So where do we go from here? And I think that this is really we're in this transition time. We've done a pilot program. We initially envisioned the pilot as a 3 to 4 month program.\nSpeaker 10: We're now six months in. We have been able to collect a lot of information. Most of that we've shared with you tonight. And we do believe that that it is a viable mobility option that Lombard should embrace and that we should transition from a pilot to a permanent program.\nSpeaker 10: This slide details a number of the items that we believe are important to be included in a ordinance that this council would adopt and really kind of building on the pilot program. So hopefully we've had an opportunity to look through the guideline book that was created as part of the pilot program.\nSpeaker 10: I think it's attached is as it's included with your staff report this evening, but there's many elements that we want to make sure that we continue to build on and and really making sure that our operators follow the the requirements that are set forth.\nSpeaker 10: We we know that we need to do more or the vendors need to be do more to educate our users. And I think certainly the subcommittee that was raised when we brought the council committee ensure or enforce or disincentivize improper use.\nSpeaker 10: So if you have people riding on the sidewalks, we want to make sure that's being enforced. If you have people riding unsafely or in areas or exceeding speed limits, etc., that they're really focusing on a program that that dissuades that or charges people or fines people for that kind of behavior.\nSpeaker 10: We think it's important to now establish a rate structure. So far, we've been operating without a fee structure for e-scooter programs. It's really just a sidewalk occupancy permit or a public right of way occupancy permit that we've utilized.\nSpeaker 10: But we think it's important if we're going to transition from a pilot to a permanent program that a fee structure be adopted. We also believe that it's important to provide equal access to E-Scooters across our city. And we know we have some neighborhoods in Long Beach where we have low income individuals and we want to create a\nSpeaker 10: rate structure to incentivize their access. So discounts for low income residents, discounted fee structure for those operators that deploy in those neighborhoods, etc.. So that's detailed on these points. And we we believe that we need to incentivize the use of drop zones.\nSpeaker 10: So consistent with the feedback that we've got through both our call center and our online survey, we believe that the drop zones are working and that providing regular opportunities for people to go and pick up a scooter and utilize the scooter, both picking up from, but also hopefully encourage dropping off in drop zones similar to our bike\nSpeaker 10: share program. We think that that's important element of a of a permanent program. So feeds. This has been somewhat of a challenge as we look through different cities and what they've used for fees. We believe that we wanted to be consistent with what other jurisdictions are doing and that there would be an annual permit fee for operators\nSpeaker 10: . Not only would we require operators to meet all of our our requirements of the program, have appropriate technology, scan for driver's license, have ability to geofence areas, etc. But there would be an annual permit fee and staff is also proposing a per unit fee.\nSpeaker 10: So beyond having the ability to operate in Long Beach, that depending on how many units are out in the city's right of way, that there is a fee associated with that. And as you can see in this, we are proposing $120 per unit fee.\nSpeaker 10: And but we would discount that for units that are operating in low income communities and propose a $40 fee for that. We do believe it's important that the staff have the ability to find operators for misuse. And for example, if scooters were left in the middle of of a beach bike path and we called the operator to\nSpeaker 10: pick them up at that operator and pick them up, that maybe city staff picked those units up, and that if those are impounded, that there's a fee to help incentivize the operators to operate appropriately in Long Beach. Also, what we found through the pilot program is many times the operators will deploy above their their approved limits.\nSpeaker 10: And if we see where operators are dropping numbers well beyond their approval limits, we want the ability to impound those as well. And then lastly, again, to ensure safe compliance and operation of a program that if operators are in noncompliance, that there's an ability to suspend their operating permit until they become compliant.\nSpeaker 10: So what are the next steps? We believe it's important to have this council take action, extending the current pilot program kind of guidelines and rules that we have in place until a permanent ordinance can be adopted. We believe it's important to adopt a rate structure and then request the city attorney to draft an ordinance consistent with what's\nSpeaker 10: been presented here and consistent with the the pilot program and any other modifications that the council may make this evening and returned to you for full adoption. And lastly, I certainly want to recognize the work of our city's mobility team, who has spent a significant and I want to repeat that a significant amount of time preparing program\nSpeaker 10: guidelines, addressing community concerns, working with our vendors and even testing the equipment for consistency with safety and speed limits. So I want to thank that team for all their hard work kind of getting us to where we are this evening.\nSpeaker 10: That concludes my presentation and we certainly stand ready to answer any questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much, Craig. I do want to point out one thing, an inconsistency in the staff report. Your written materials say that we're proposing three vendors were actually, as Craig's mentioned, were proposing a cap of up to four vendors for the city council to consider.\nSpeaker 2: So that will be a recommendation.\nSpeaker 0: The staff of anything else. Okay. I'm going to make a couple comments and then let me get to gonna get to Councilmember Pearce and then we'll open up to some discussion with the council as well as public comment.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Pearce, would you prefer to do public comment first or do you want the council to. Okay. Why don't we just do that first and then I'll make my comment. So any public comment on this item, please come forward.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening. My name is Lynne Smothers Reece. I live on Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach. I'm probably in the minority, but I consider the.\nSpeaker 2: Scooters a nuisance.\nSpeaker 6: I like to walk. I walk my dog several times a day. I can't count the number of times I've had to jump out of the way of scooters riding on the sidewalk. Normally it's one or two at a time.\nSpeaker 6: Last night at 915. It was a group of five. It's pretty unsafe for elderly people. Or like my friend Adrian, who has a is partially blind. The scooters on the sidewalk is a big issue in my area. There's also some safety concerns.\nSpeaker 6: My a few months ago.\nSpeaker 9: My husband and I were.\nSpeaker 6: Driving on seaside and Pine going towards the pike. Two teenagers, they were young. Okay? They probably shouldn't have been on the scooters. I don't know how they did this, but they were going down the hill on pine towards the pike.\nSpeaker 6: We almost hit them. We have the light. We have the right of way. And they almost did not stop. So I have safety concerns and I'd like to be able to walk. I live in an area where the is there are signs posted that bicycles are not.\nSpeaker 2: Allowed on the sidewalk.\nSpeaker 6: Bicycles are always on the sidewalk. So in addition to the bicyclist, I now have to dodge the the scooter riders. And I'm you know, I kind of chuckled a little bit when I saw that 17 citations were given for riding on the sidewalk when it's a daily occurrence for us.\nSpeaker 6: So I'd like the council to keep that in mind. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please. I'm going to close out the speakers list as well. So we have one, two, three, four, five. We have six speakers and then I'm closing. I'm sorry. Okay. We have eight speakers and I'm closing the speaker's list.\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead. Very good to.\nSpeaker 2: Address on file number one. I think you should. Get the views of. Each and every Long Beach transit bus driver or bus driver, I think you will find those are 100% opposed to these. Scooters. My sense is that if people don't like riding bikes.\nSpeaker 2: What they should just get used to is the Buster Brown Express. It's always been very reliable. He'll get you there. Keep your eyes open. Get you there safely. This just.\nSpeaker 10: Invites further.\nSpeaker 2: Litigation against the city. Again talk to. The risk principle, Long Beach transit drivers annuals. They will share with you their view, their professional views on this. You're heading down a path that is going to be very, very expensive to this city in terms of liability.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Vice Mayor. I'm sorry. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. My name is Linda Sperry, and my husband and I have been in Long Beach as property owners in the third district and First District for the past 26 years. As a breast cancer survivor, I walked five, 4 to 5 miles almost every day.\nSpeaker 11: And my comments tonight are based on on what I see. I respectfully disagree with some of the findings that Mr. Beck has articulated. But I'd like to share share with you what my experience has been. I'm proud that Long Beach has been recognized numerous times as one of America's most walkable cities.\nSpeaker 11: I'm very, very grateful to live here. My concern tonight is that our city's walkability is being severely threatened because of the reckless e-scooter riders on our sidewalks and the total lack of enforcement. Until there is a realistic, responsible sidewalk enforcement program in place to protect protesters and such as myself from the 15 mile per hour e-scooters.\nSpeaker 11: I don't feel you should adopt the plan before you. On the videotape of the December Transportation Infrastructure Committee meeting, a public works engineer stated that the scooter companies cannot prevent scooters from being ridden on the sidewalks. He admitted that the Geofencing capability to accomplish this is not possible at this time.\nSpeaker 11: This fact was confirmed on that same videotape by the government relations representative for Bird, who acknowledged that there absolutely is a problem with sidewalk riders and that bird is thinking of a technology to deal with the problem. Yesterday I spoke with a mobility micro-mobility venture capitalist on the phone, and I confirm that he confirmed that the technology\nSpeaker 11: is not available. He stated to me that the scooter scooter jeeps cannot be used to control scooter use on sidewalks because it doesn't have the necessary level of accuracy. He said there is technology in the works by G and Bluetooth beacon tech, but that that in theory would provide enough resolution as to be able to enforce this\nSpeaker 11: . But this is still some time away from widespread deployment. Please reject the proposal before you tonight to add more scooters. How will the scooter companies accountable for enforcement? Something that, in my opinion, should have happened a long time ago.\nSpeaker 11: I ask you to put the best interests of your constituents first. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 6: Karen Reside, resident of District one, and that the older adults that I've surveyed actually have a lot of them have ridden the scooters and they would love to have the triangular based ones for older people. So and for people that are less stabled and also if there can be a means for those that are somewhat disabled, they'd\nSpeaker 6: like to use them to. I agree there are all these issues. But as our city moves to smart technology in our streets, I think a lot of these can be overcome. Working together with the scooter manufacturers and the venture capitalists, I think can bring me more resources so we can maybe move forward a little faster.\nSpeaker 6: My concern about the scooters is they travel in the main thoroughfares and I see them quite frequently in groups. None of them wear helmets. And UCLA is just in a study on scooter accidents. And the accidents that occurred with scooters tended to be serious head injuries and primarily because they were not wearing scooters.\nSpeaker 6: So yeah, and I've seen one person. Get access to scooters for a whole group of younger people to put them on there. So there is a way to restrict the number of scooters that one person can have access to.\nSpeaker 6: And, you know, if we could do it safely and have them ride on the sidewalks, I know in some areas that's primarily where they're traveling as the heavy corridors where there are little wider sidewalks. If we could somehow mark lanes are some way to keep them separated from the pedestrian traffic.\nSpeaker 6: And I'd also like to add some kind of because they are so quiet, a number of people have been hit, especially people that are hard of hearing, hard of vision. They've almost been hit because they can't see or hear them coming.\nSpeaker 6: I've gotten so. I just stopped and let them go around me. But there's got to be a better way to do that on the streets. But older people like them, too. They would like to have more access. And the sidewalks think about where the safer sidewalks are because a lot of our sidewalks are problematic and make it\nSpeaker 6: so there would be more hazards for scooter riders. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next, bigger, please.\nSpeaker 12: Hi. Ed Cockrell, seventh District. You know, I actually didn't come here to speak to you guys about this, but it's on the agenda. And I really wanted to comment about this. So I am actually for this. For this.\nSpeaker 12: Many times we don't have the access to greener and environmentally friendly mobile transportation. And I think this is a really good opportunity for us to expand that green energy piece. I would like to see that the city actually looks at the beach.\nSpeaker 12: I think, you know, we don't we don't regulate bikers who go above 15 miles per hour. So why do we have to regulate the scooters? I get it. You don't want to have the beach full of scooters. But I think if you have more public safety awareness on this, because the bike riding the bike on the sidewalk\nSpeaker 12: , that's a public safety issue. Riding the scooter, that's another public safety issue. Actually, I don't like riding the bike. Ah, the scooter on the sidewalk, because the sidewalks aren't always paved smoothly. I'm actually going to have to dove over the crack in the scooter or the crack in the sidewalk.\nSpeaker 12: So I just encourage people to be open about this, to look at this as a green initiative to help our city stay on the map for green initiatives. Take.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: How's it going, Mayor and City Council. My name is and I can say I'm a fan of the e-scooters I recently. It's funny because I see the age limit thing and that's definitely not being enforced because my little cousin, he just put me onto the scooters and I've been whipping around.\nSpeaker 2: I've been enjoying, you know, the city in a whole new light, going 15.2 miles an hour. And I enjoy it, to be honest. You know, it saves me a lot of money. Usually I have to take about two busses to go to work.\nSpeaker 2: I work in and sorry those area ups and now because the scooter instead of having to wake up another 3045 minutes earlier so I can either walk to catch one of the busses that I take to go to work.\nSpeaker 2: Now I just hop on one of the scooters and just ride that distance. And then, you know, I saved myself about two, $2.50 a day. You know, some went for 50 bucks a month. So it's actually helping me in terms of budgeting in my life, in terms of some of the options that city staff mentioned recommended to\nSpeaker 2: mitigate and figure out how are going to make this go from being a pilot program to one that is part of city structure. I think there's a lot of options there that I agree with. I think about like when my cousin lives off the corner of a six in Coronado, there's more access to scooters there, primarily lime\nSpeaker 2: , I would say. Whereas in Wrigley area, you know, it's it's more of the more the bird ones and there's not as much easily access to them. So if there is maybe to be a a price or tax reduced incentive for the lower income areas, I think that would be a more feasible way to spread out access to\nSpeaker 2: these scooters. I think I'm not an advocate for either company or working for either company, but I noticed that certain companies use the Uber network to access the scooters. I believe lime and bird specifically, or maybe it's just one or the other.\nSpeaker 2: I think those should be the ones that we should focus on. You know, not I don't want to say monopolize the scooter program, but maybe prioritize them because it seems like I see a lot more companies that are competitors that no one really uses, to be honest.\nSpeaker 2: And also, I think too, that the we are hopefully misunderstanding the impact of this on the youth. This is an opportunity to have a generation of of younger people be occupied with the idea of not using a car.\nSpeaker 2: So I think this focus on adults only riding scooters is a misstep. And we should figure out a way to enforce helmets as well as focus on these maybe being around school district schools dropoff zones and specifically so that we have less kids driving around or less Ubers being used.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. And we have four speakers left and then the speaker's list is closed.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor. Council members, name and address on file. I'm here to speak on this issue as an architect, an urban planner with an interest in mass transit, in walkable cities and environmentalism. I've traveled to different countries in the world South America, mainly throughout North America and to Europe, and looked at issues such as bicycling and other\nSpeaker 2: micromobility issues. So in that regard, mainly I am in support of the SCOOTER program. I want to talk a little bit about cost. I'm the according to Tripoli, the average cost to own and operate a vehicle is about $50 per day.\nSpeaker 2: This is their statistics, Tripoli and it includes the purchase financing, gas, registration, insurance, etc.. But in addition to that, there's there's there there is infrastructure costs there. And, you know, we're we're building a bunch of big buildings, big apartment buildings here in downtown Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: And it costs an average of $30,000 per parking space for a vehicle. So having a wider infrastructure for scooters would greatly reduce those costs. It would also reduce road construction and maintenance. There's a cost of accidents that we don't typically take into account when looking at these types of transportation, both personal and property costs.\nSpeaker 2: Obviously, getting hit by a 30 \u00a3500 vehicle is a little bit more painful. And then getting hit by a \u00a330 scooter. There's there's also an issue of long term cost to society. The vehicles with their emissions, you know, cause cancers and neurological diseases.\nSpeaker 2: And and even further away, the issues such as sea level rise and extinction, the extinction of species. You know, we drive far these 30 \u00a3500 vehicles that are capable of taking a family of four from L.A. to New York and yet are typically it's just one person per vehicle.\nSpeaker 2: So it just doesn't make sense. More scooters is is is the way to go. I last I want to add that the issue of safety if people if classes can be held in public libraries and schools for how to use scooters or senior centers, because, you know, I've seen new people stumbling, trying to use a scooter for\nSpeaker 2: the first time. And it's it's not quite as easy as it would seem.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. Mike Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: But evening council and the mayor. My name is Richard Fernandez. My address is two, four, three, five East 14th Street in Long Beach. I don't know. For I'm going to be speaking on behalf of me as a charger for the company of Bert.\nSpeaker 2: And what has Bert has brought upon me and many of my coworkers? It's an opportunity and new ways to bring extra income towards our lifestyle and we are very fortunate about that. But I would also like to address the fact that there is some inconsistencies in terms of the infrastructure and everything with the burden, because I've witnessed\nSpeaker 2: it and I would like to deeply apologize to everyone who actually have had to go through all that. You know, with the scooters being on the sidewalks, the inconsistency of the helmets, I understand all that. But from where I live, there seems to be a kind of a lifestyle where parking's an issue.\nSpeaker 2: Driving a vehicle is not really, you know, the norm in terms of commuting. But a lot of my neighbors and a lot of people that I've seen and I've just when I go to playing, just been talking to me like all these ever since these scooters have been here, I've been able to commute as little as a\nSpeaker 2: mile and not really worrying about moving my car, parking my car, using diesel fuel or gas fuel for in order to get to some places, we're actually going more greener in terms of means of travel. But I but the majority of the people I've been saying is that they would I would like to see more scooters, but\nSpeaker 2: also the enforcement side of it does need more work. And in terms of the enforcement, that is still, I believe in more of a development stage as of right now. But for me personally, as a as I just got off of my job just earlier and just went straight here, this helped me tremendously since I have been\nSpeaker 2: I've actually gone a while without work. But the bird company has actually helped me being able to help pay for my rent in order to pursue my career and as a musician. So I have some money in order to pay the rent.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm very benefit grateful for that. And I'm and I'm for this program for, for any reasons that is being in terms of the police enforcement or whatever kind of enforcement needed in order to keep it as a safe program.\nSpeaker 2: I believe that in some ways it's the same thing as the bicycle. I believe that is a very beneficial program in terms of commuting and for a greener environment in our city. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, everybody. My name is Carla Monaghan. I am lives community affairs manager for the Greater Los Angeles region. First and foremost, I just want to thank counsel for.\nSpeaker 4: Allowing me to speak today.\nSpeaker 1: Lime has.\nSpeaker 4: Loved being a part of the Long Beach community by providing thousands of Long Beach residents with affordable and sustainable shared transportation.\nSpeaker 1: Options. So far, the scooters have proven to be a great new addition to the city's transportation network, as evidenced by the 100,000 plus.\nSpeaker 4: Rides that have been taken on limes alone. Lime is constantly evaluating the effect of higher fees as they limit the ability to provide our riders with affordable and convenient rides that they desire.\nSpeaker 1: It's for this reason that.\nSpeaker 4: We are concerned to see a recommended per scooter fee of $120 per year.\nSpeaker 1: Which would act significant cost to operators so large, in fact, that.\nSpeaker 4: We may be forced to raise our prices and it would limit our ability.\nSpeaker 1: To more.\nSpeaker 4: Equitably distribute our vehicles throughout the city. And it could make scooters a lot less attractive as a mobility option, thus not really reducing as many car trips. We encourage the city.\nSpeaker 1: To move.\nSpeaker 4: Forward with a per trip fee that has been.\nSpeaker 1: Adopted in other cities, including Santa Ana, which is not too far from here. This allows the.\nSpeaker 4: City to capture revenue from our rides and it encourages equitable distribution throughout the city.\nSpeaker 1: We also encourage Council to.\nSpeaker 4: Reconsider the 6000 vehicle.\nSpeaker 1: Cap and instead implement a dynamic cap.\nSpeaker 4: Where the increase in fleet size would need to be supported by utilization data that shows an average of two trucks per vehicle per day. We are happy to provide staff with additional information. We remain proud of our impact in communities around the globe and we really look forward to maintaining a meaningful partnership with the city of Long\nSpeaker 4: Beach. Please consider these comments as limes. Respectfully request that you vote in favor of a per trip fee with a dynamic cap.\nSpeaker 1: Again, I would like to thank Council for your time and for allowing lime.\nSpeaker 13: To be a part of this public decision making process.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. And our final speaker. Good evening, Mayor Garcia.\nSpeaker 2: City Council members. My name is Tim Harder. I handle government partnerships at Bird. We appreciate the thoughtful work that city staff members have put into the pilot program and the proposed regulations before you tonight.\nSpeaker 5: We appreciate the needs of the city and its.\nSpeaker 2: Citizens through reasonable regulations that adhere to safety and best practices while acknowledging the use and value of scooters as a viable last, first and last mile option. I really need to pause here and thank your city staff for all the work that's gone into the program.\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it's absolute a lot. We actually recommend your city staff to other cities across the country because of what time they put into this. So just want to.\nSpeaker 5: Point that out to.\nSpeaker 2: Your colleagues. Chappelle's accountable while also soliciting our collective feedback on potential regulations.\nSpeaker 5: We greatly appreciate that.\nSpeaker 2: From in the framework, Bird is ready to deliver on many of these requirements, especially around technology issues that've been brought up around throttling down speed.\nSpeaker 5: And prescribed areas through geofencing, which we already do on the Long Beach bike path.\nSpeaker 2: Constantly monitoring data for Long Beach, ensuring that data with city staff is really important for us, making sure that we hit all those points. We have no parking zones. Not that the city center's asking all operators to comply within 24 hours.\nSpeaker 2: We're the only operator to make that option to have no parking zones created for the city. So these are all kinds of technology things that we are working on and continue to improve on. We've been operating for over almost two.\nSpeaker 5: Years now, which is crazy.\nSpeaker 2: But it's a growing fast and we're learning a lot. We do have a couple of items that we've learned from during the pilot from our pilot program to share with you. The drop zone locations are very difficult to work around.\nSpeaker 2: As you saw, there are 230 drop zone locations in a 50 square mile city. What that means is that I have to start my birds in those nest locations every morning and I'm only allowed to put six in each of those decals.\nSpeaker 2: With the proposed operation of 6000 scooters. You would need at least 1000 of these locations across the city to be effective. We also had to pay for all these decals at $3 each. These these costs add up. And to keep our sustainable, affordable transportation option on the road, these costs can't keep on happening.\nSpeaker 2: So we believe the fees are proposed are too high. We would ask for there to be a lower per vehicle fee across the market for Olive Long Beach or consider it or consideration of a per ride fee for all rides.\nSpeaker 2: If we want to get more people out of cars, we ask that you allow us to keep our business sustainable at the pro staff fee or take offers much longer to bring access to our Long Beach. Let me point out, one city, Raleigh, recently passed a $200 fee per vehicle.\nSpeaker 2: We had to increase our lock fee from $1 to $3 per e-scooter at $0.15 a minute. These costs make us close to the cost of an Uber or Lyft that you can have at your front door in 2 minutes.\nSpeaker 2: Bird supports the direction the city is going in craftiness regulation such as incentivizing parking locations, technological solutions. And we look forward to continuing this dialog with your officers. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak on behalf of Bird.\nSpeaker 2: We look forward to continue to serve the community and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Well, thank you very much. And I want to thank all of our public speakers. We're going to go to the council here in just a minute. And I know that there's going to be some questions and discuss and discussion about many of the items that were raised tonight and around fees and just the process and the staffing\nSpeaker 0: . And so I think we all look forward to those those discussions and and that conversation. I do want to make some more general comments because this is an issue that I've been closely monitoring and watching. The first thing I'll say is that I think that this this technology is is new.\nSpeaker 0: And like all new technologies, there are growing pains of learning what's the best way of adopting the technology and what's the best way of ensuring that people are safe and that enforcement is also happening? This was similar to when the city really began an expansion of its bicycle network.\nSpeaker 0: We experience similar growing pains and learning how to best put in bike boulevards and in bikeways. And I remember a lot of these similar conversations happening then as well. I'll also say that I think this is an incredibly exciting moment for multimodal transportation.\nSpeaker 0: And if we are going to meet our future objectives as they relate to climate change and as they relate to sustainable green communities and really planning cities for everyone, I believe that this technology and others that are being developed, whether they're around electric bicycles or around other scooter models for, for example, seniors were mentioned.\nSpeaker 0: There are, I know models that are being developed that some have seats and they're a little wider and there's all sorts of things happening to ensure that people can get around. That's not to say that there haven't been challenges around scooters being left in places that shouldn't be left in in the middle of the sidewalk or on\nSpeaker 0: the street. That is all true. And so I just want to I want folks to know that we have heard all of that as well. And I think that the companies at the table and the city are interested in really finding the best way to implement this.\nSpeaker 0: I will also say, having talked to many mayors that are implementing these scooter programs across the country and talking to the companies at the table. We have actually, I think, done in Long Beach a much better job of our rollout than many other cities across the state of California.\nSpeaker 0: And so I really want to commend the staff. Mr. Beck, you and your whole team, I think you've really worked with the council members individually with a lot of their concerns, as well as the community to try to address some of these.\nSpeaker 0: Does it mean we've we've addressed all the issues and it doesn't mean that we still don't have challenges that are out there. But I just do want to commend the staff for that work. A couple of things that were interesting to me on the data, which I think is really important to look at.\nSpeaker 0: I was also very surprised that only one third of those writing were actually using them for recreation purposes. Over half of folks that are writing the scooters are using them to essentially get to work, complete an errand, or to get around and to actually do a function that they find necessary for their for their life to and\nSpeaker 0: to see those numbers reflected in the data, I think is really, really important. I think that having also the fact that I think it's 15% are using them to get to and from another form of transportation I think is also a very successful metric.\nSpeaker 0: We talk all the time in the transit world of how do you get folks from that bus that they're getting off to their home in a safe way? Or how do we get someone from the blue line to their next area of transportation and those first, last, first mile, last mile connections that is clearly happening on these\nSpeaker 0: scooters, I think is really critical as well. There is no question when you have almost 200,000 rides in a short, multi-month pilot program, there is a demand and we're not. What I see and I think I've talked to some some of the councilmembers I mentioned this to me, I see a lot of young people and youth using\nSpeaker 0: these to get around. Incredibly diverse reflects reflection of the community. And what's impressed me is this isn't just folks, you know, picking a a lime or a bird up to, you know, enjoy a nice Saturday afternoon. You're seeing young people and and workers pick these up.\nSpeaker 0: I see it in central Long Beach and end of the downtown. People getting to work or people trying to get somewhere where they need to go. And I think that's been impressive to see that as well. And so I just want to commend the companies and for for providing a service in the city that people actively want\nSpeaker 0: to use. And the final thing I'll say is this technology is quickly changing as well. And so I want to make sure that the staff is, as we have this conversation tonight, that we are, we're always open. You know, we're open to all those changes in the technology and where and where kind of this multimodal piece is\nSpeaker 0: going. And so things change very fast, for example, in our bike share program. And you know what? We what what we did a couple of years ago, we may not want to replicate today. And I want to be sure the same thing is, is that we're being as thoughtful in the scooter program that we are willing and\nSpeaker 0: open to to changes in the marketplace. And with that, let me turn this over. And again, I'm very supportive of the of the conversation the council's going to have about how we can make this even a stronger program.\nSpeaker 0: But thank you to the public and to what I think is a very successful opportunity for us. Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mayor, and really thank you, staff. I think it's great to have companies come up and talk about how wonderful you guys have been, how they have had other people come to our staff to find out how to do it.\nSpeaker 7: It really shows that you are taking a measured and thoughtful approach to bringing on a new technology. And so I think myself in the second District and my council colleague in the third district, when you look at the maps, you really see that our districts are the ones that have been most impacted.\nSpeaker 7: And so I'm really happy to say that I've met with the companies, I've met with residents this week. I met with a group of residents that actually own their own scooters. And we're really concerned that regulating the e-scooters would change their their pathway.\nSpeaker 7: So I have a couple of questions about, you know, echoing everything that the mayor said around a sustainable city. I think getting people out of cars, getting myself out of a car is a very big challenge and having something that's dependable.\nSpeaker 7: And so we know when you look across the city and look at the maps that these scooters have been in one area. And I think that that's one of the challenges that one of my constituents spoke about earlier is having so many of them in the area that it tends to be kind of overwhelming at first.\nSpeaker 7: And I think that that was what hit us in the beginning is that all of a sudden there are a bunch of scooters on the ground. And so we didn't really phase in. And now they've been here a little while and making sure that we're changing the culture with adding additional scooters but adding additional education platforms.\nSpeaker 7: So I was hoping that you could talk a little bit of staff, could talk a little bit about some of the technology, specifically that these companies have that we feel confident. Because I remember our conversation with the pilot program was really about companies not having certain capabilities.\nSpeaker 7: And I know that once we're off the pilot program that those capabilities are in place. Can you talk about that?\nSpeaker 10: Certainly, Councilmember, thank you for the question. I wanted to highlight a couple of things. At first, I think the mayor alluded to it in his comments, which is tonight we're really promoting a micromobility ordinance and not just e-scooters.\nSpeaker 10: We think it's important that we are understanding that this is a changing environment. And for example, if a company wanted to come in and provide e-bikes or I think one of the audience members spoke about tricycles, maybe tricycles that were hopeful that that can all be governed under the ordinance that council considers this evening.\nSpeaker 10: So I wanted to point that out. I didn't mention that in my previous presentation, but we do believe that technology is going to be very important, that what we are finding is that there are areas in the city that may not be appropriate for e-scooters or e-bikes, etc. And so having that ability to geofence certain zones, we\nSpeaker 10: want to make sure we're working with vendors that have the ability to geofence zones. So I'll give you a very specific example. Long Beach Unified School District has reached out to the city and said that they do not want to see E-Scooters riding on their playgrounds, that they believe schools should be a free micromobility zone.\nSpeaker 10: And so while Long Beach City College or a high school or anybody authorized to to ride a scooter should come up to the front. They shouldn't be able to go beyond that front door. So having that technology and working with vendors that are able to do that are going to be important for our success moving forward.\nSpeaker 7: Can you talk beyond? Yes. You're looking at me knowing I was going to.\nSpeaker 10: Yeah. So I think the other point that I know you and I have talked about and I've actually talked about with some other of the members is where do we make that connection? So safety has been both brought up in this chamber and brought up by the community and and evidence through the information that we've received through\nSpeaker 10: our surveys, etc.. So having links to instructional videos, making sure that we are scanning driver's license, you know, that technology exists and providing maybe a certificate that yes, I have watched a YouTube video and how to safely operate an e-scooter and knowing that I can't ride on the sidewalk and I need to ride in the street, in\nSpeaker 10: bike parts, etc., that that all becomes part of, of a full program moving forward.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. And that that wasn't a part of the pilot program. So I just want to make that clear for constituents. That pilot program was like Scooter Lite and that going on board with a full program means we're going to have some more technology at our fingertips.\nSpeaker 7: I know whenever I was looking at the maps that there were some questions about and I know that Councilmember Richardson is not here tonight, but North Long Beach, and I know that that Al is here and we'll talk about it.\nSpeaker 7: Deployment. I've heard that they get deployed and then they kind of trickle back down to downtown. And so how are we making sure that while we say this is a citywide plan, that in fact, this is citywide.\nSpeaker 10: So certainly I think there's a couple of ways. If you look at the pilot program guidelines, we we essentially divided the city into three zones and we required the companies to have a minimum of that of 20% of their fleet in that zone.\nSpeaker 10: So if you had authorization to deploy a thousand scooters as an example in the city, you would need a minimum of 200 of those scooters in each of the three zones. If you decided one zone was more advantageous for your operation than another, you could certainly do more than the 200, but you would need a 200 as\nSpeaker 10: a minimum. So certainly it's a very real probability that somebody could pick up a scooter, stay in zone two in Central on beach and ride down to the beach and leave the scooter down here and maybe Uber home or get picked up or whatever the case may be.\nSpeaker 10: That's why we do believe it is important to rebalance the system. And for for the most part, it's been really good working relationship with the vendors and they are complying. I do think that they see an advantage of picking the scooters up, making sure that they're safe and charged and ready to be deployed the next morning, and\nSpeaker 10: ensuring that they get redeployed back out into the various zones. So that's an element of this program that that staff strongly believes in, and that's why it's part of our recommendations this evening.\nSpeaker 7: Great. Thank you. I've got two more question. One is on the existing oh. The name escapes me. But where they park them, the stickers that are on the sidewalk.\nSpeaker 10: Are drop.\nSpeaker 7: Zone. Yeah. Those stickers in my district are ripped to shreds, and they look like a hot mess. Talk to me. What are we doing? Sorry to put you on the spot on that one.\nSpeaker 10: Well, hopefully we can address the hot mess issue, but I think beyond that, I think when we start looking at the drop zones and you know, I want to thank Bird for that comment tonight. Maybe six scooters per drop zone is is not the right number.\nSpeaker 10: So we're certainly open to adjusting that. We we think there's going to be locations where more than six are appropriate and we're looking to have more universal drop zones. So I don't know that you need a drop zone for bird and one for lime and designate them that way.\nSpeaker 10: But let's find city designated drop zones that any of the approved vendors could utilize. We think that there's also a way to to streamline the decanting process to to make it less costly. I still think it's important to have a recognizable location because that helps address some of the order that we're looking for among our public right\nSpeaker 10: of way. And, and, and part of our fee structure could help support that. We can either take that on ourselves as a city to ensure that they're meeting our standards or rely on the vendors to continue to do that.\nSpeaker 10: So those are things that I think we need to refine as this program moves forward.\nSpeaker 7: I just have this image of like a pole with a little flag that says E-Scooters. Okay, my next question. My last question really is around what you just talked about is the fees and looking at page 11 and considering that right now, do vendors pay a per vehicle fee in the pilot program?\nSpeaker 10: No, councilmember. Right now we do not have an adopted fee structure in place.\nSpeaker 7: And so if the goal of this program is to get people out of their cars and onto scooters, I mean, that's my personal goal and my district, knowing that we're parking impacted, can you just talk to me a little bit about where this this fee came from and why it is 120 and 40?\nSpeaker 7: And where the money goes.\nSpeaker 10: Yes, certainly. Thank you. So I think really, as you start thinking from a pilot mentality, and I think you mentioned and I like that verbiage, scooter lite and certainly that was the pilot we wanted to try to wrap our arms around.\nSpeaker 10: What does it mean to have micromobility in Long Beach and where do we see challenges and how do we best address those challenges? And so we started to really look at, okay, if we were to transition from a pilot only to a permanent program, what are those continued impacts going to be for our community?\nSpeaker 10: I think you had some residents here this evening expressing concerns about occupying the sidewalk, riding on sidewalk. It's very important that we address that through enforcement. So when we looked at our fee structure, we didn't want to be the lowest.\nSpeaker 10: We didn't want to be the highest. We tried to look at large cities similar in size to two Long Beach and adopt structures similar to that. We do believe a per unit cost is appropriate only because the more units a vendor has, ultimately the more potential impacts we're creating within the right of way.\nSpeaker 10: We do also look at where is the future for parking these devices. And right now we're relying on our sidewalks, but sidewalks are going to continue to to be in demand as we look at our sidewalk dining ordinances, as we look at our PARKLET program.\nSpeaker 10: So we think, if you recall, when this council adopted the Parklet, one of the items that we included as an eligible use was parking bikes or potentially e-scooters. So we do think that the city still needs to potentially make some investments and where there could be an opportunity to have scooters park in the street in a parklet\nSpeaker 10: designated a zone, I'll give you an example. So a fourth street in that kind of cherry juniper corridor, very popular destination you noticed in the heat maps. If you saw that that we see a lot of riders either starting from or ending in that area very narrow sidewalks and fourth street.\nSpeaker 10: We we barely have ADA accessibility now. It's not there's not a lot of opportunity to add scooters there and a parklet may be an option in that instance. And so we know that there are sidewalks replicated throughout our city similar to that, and that we want to be very open to solutions.\nSpeaker 10: So again, fee structures not only help address that, that right of way challenge, but we also believe it's important that we have full time staff dedicated to Micromobility, which we currently do not have. And this program, while I absolutely commend all the staff work that's been done, it has detracted our ability to deliver other items that I\nSpeaker 10: know are important to this council. And so while we've shifted focus to make sure that we're aligned on on Micromobility, other things have slipped. And I think it's important that we have fee structures in place that allow us to support those staff, support enforcement, support infrastructure development.\nSpeaker 10: And we don't believe that we're out of line. Certainly if the fees need to be adjusted, that's something that that we believe is important to come back and address. But we would caution I would caution you tonight to not go too low.\nSpeaker 10: But knowing that I'm recommending as a staff this evening that we have a check in point and that we really look at what's working and what's not. Again, we're moving from E-Scooter Lite into a permanent program. We know that permanent program is probably going to need a little tweaking in the future as well.\nSpeaker 10: So we would encourage that. We have a check in point and address some things at that check in point.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you so much for that, Mr. Beck. I, I definitely you know, I support making sure that we have fees to run the program. I support that it's it's going to take an impact on on our infrastructure, on our staffing.\nSpeaker 7: And so I don't want to, you know, say let's gut it, but I don't want us to get into a situation where people then decide to use an Uber or Lyft because now they're not getting on a scooter, because we do see so many people using these for actually getting around and not just joyriding.\nSpeaker 7: It's not their entertainment dollars, it's their transportation dollars.\nSpeaker 6: So I have.\nSpeaker 7: One other question before I move on on this, as it says, for low income areas. And so getting back to that idea of drift, how do we is that based on where they're deployed? How do we differentiate what's low income and not?\nSpeaker 10: Yeah, I think Stephan thinking through that and we would rely on census information and look at census tracks. And so let's just say Zone one has 30% census tracts meet the low income criteria we would allow if a vendor was approved and deployed X-number in that zone, 30% of those would be charged at that lower rate.\nSpeaker 10: So that would be our approach. We're certainly open to ideas and if council has other thoughts about how that could happen. But that is where we believe the data we would use to develop that criteria and how we would set up that fee.\nSpeaker 7: I'm just so I mean, I've been working with this through the last couple of days and I guess I while I love the idea of having low income areas, having a reduced fee, recognizing that might add another layer.\nSpeaker 7: And so I want to hear what my colleagues think on on the per vehicle fee, but everything from cutting it in half for the next year or you said you're coming back in January, you know, doing that until January and then saying, okay, do we want to change the fees at that time or is it, you know\nSpeaker 7: , $80 across the board just trying to get to a place where we make sure we don't cross that threshold. So I want to hear from my colleagues. I'm just curious, want to make sure we support staff, the program, the residents that need to make sure that they have safety measures in place.\nSpeaker 7: So, again, thank you guys so very much. I know this has been an intense process for everybody.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. And I, too, want to thank staff, especially Michelle Marie and Tony Cruz, because they've been our go to staff members from public works on this issue. And I think the third district has referred hundreds of residents to them directly and they have responded with very detailed and thorough responses to each and every inquiry we have\nSpeaker 8: sent them. So I'm grateful for that, and I want to thank Director Beck and his leadership of that team. So I you know, I agree with a lot of the comments that were made by the mayor. I do agree that a lot of the the concerns that have been raised and most of the concerns for anyone who\nSpeaker 8: reviewed the survey data came from my district to my residents. And over the last few months, we've received hundreds of emails, especially the last 24 hours, regarding the scooters. I think most residents find them to be objectionable for a variety of reasons.\nSpeaker 8: Most of the residents who have reached out to us, the sidewalk riding is a huge issue and of course, the abandoned scooters. And and while I agree with the mayor, any time there's a major change, whether it's in terms of mobility or infrastructure or traffic flow, there is a lot of opposition, generally speaking, and I agree with\nSpeaker 8: that. The problem with scooters that I see is that they leave a long standing reminder of what it is that people don't like about them. So when they're abandoned on a sidewalk, on a beach path, wherever the case may be in a roundabout, as happens in my neighborhood all the time, literally in the middle of the roundabout\nSpeaker 8: , I think it is almost starts to take the shape of debris and people start to view it as debris that the city there's this there's this thought that the city is not taking care of infrastructure. The city is not picking up after these companies, not that it's the city's responsibility to do, but that is one of the\nSpeaker 8: major concerns that I have. So I will say tonight that I cannot vote. And I know where most of my council colleagues stand on this issue. Everyone has been very supportive of it in the past. Having said that, there's really only a few districts that are actively engaged in the pilot program and seeing hundreds of scooters permitted\nSpeaker 8: to be used in those districts. So for us, we may have heard from residents more so than other districts, and I guarantee that once they're deployed everywhere, there will be numerous. I mean, if you've even if you've had a few dumped in the in the area in your district, there's nothing like hundreds of scooters being abandoned throughout\nSpeaker 8: the community that that can cause concern. So I would not be able to support anything tonight, even though I know most of my colleagues are very supportive of this program without a compliance piece. So I fully support Director Beck's recommendation that we have staff dedicated specifically to helping with compliance.\nSpeaker 8: And I will say it was it directly pointed out in the presentation, but I'll be the first to say it. The operators with whom the city has entered a partnership could do a much better job of partnering with the city.\nSpeaker 8: In terms of compliance, I believe that in some circumstances the regular reporting wasn't done and in many circumstances the city had to reach out not for every provider, but had to reach out and remind the providers of the rules.\nSpeaker 8: And just a few months ago, I brought an item forward to actually try to do more to ensure compliance with an already existing limitation by the companies that they were violating. So it's to me, you know, if you're going to go for a job interview, you're going to put your best foot forward and you're going to try\nSpeaker 8: to be as compliant as you can be. And not all of the operators have done that. And I and I really question. Our decision to continue moving with those folks if in fact, they weren't compliant during the pilot.\nSpeaker 8: But I defer to the sound judgment of our public works department because ultimately it's going to be our public works department who has to deal with the citizen complaints and managing as the liaison with these companies. I think that, you know, if we.\nSpeaker 8: One of the things I would like to request that this motion include is that the fees that are collected would first go to paying for compliance of this scooter program before they're spent on anything else outside of the scooter policy.\nSpeaker 8: And I don't know if the maker of the motion is agreeable to that. Okay. She seems to be. The other issue that I have is with the number of them that are released, I think the 6000 number that.\nSpeaker 8: The staff report recommends is a little aggressive right off the chute. What I would recommend and again, I'd ask the maker of the motion if she is amenable to this, is that we come back in six months for the in that the director mentioned and that we have a cap on the number of scooters that we increase\nSpeaker 8: or we put into cities production between now and the next six months. And maybe and I'll throw that number I'll throw a number out there, but I'm totally open to hearing from my colleagues. But maybe we cap it at 4000 instead of 6000.\nSpeaker 8: We come back and six months we evaluate the program, we evaluate compliance, we evaluate what technology is in place by these operators to address some of the concerns that we have that I'm going to talk about in a moment, and then we can adjust from there.\nSpeaker 8: And I don't know what the maker of the motion thinks about that. A six month compliance. And of course we can. Yeah, we'll hear from everyone. But is that Director Beck? Is that feasible? A six month check and date?\nSpeaker 10: Council member. Yes, I think six months is fine. But I would I would want to stress that it would be six months after adoption of the permanent program, because we still have to work with the attorney's office to to outline and have that written and come back to council for adoption.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. I understand. I know that some of the providers have excellent, excellent technology in place and others don't. Can you educate me a little bit about whether or not we have the ability through geofencing, technology to, you know, limit speeds in certain areas?\nSpeaker 8: I know that the sidewalk technology has still yet to be developed. As one of the residents pointed out. I think they're, you know, months away from developing that to the point where we can use it. But what about other types of technology?\nSpeaker 8: I know Bird, their representative, talked about in the no parking zones. I actually had a chance to go on their app and see how the no parking zones work and learned tonight that if somebody dumps a scooter in a no parking zone, that their meter continues to run.\nSpeaker 8: And I didn't know that. So they continue to get charged. I think that's excellent. But do all of them have this technology and are we going to partner with companies that don't have this technology? And if so, how are we going to ensure that they're compliant?\nSpeaker 10: So thank you for the opportunity to stress that. I think it's very important that as we move forward, we are working with vendors that that are deploying the the latest technology, not only no parking zones, geofencing, but the opportunity to cut speed.\nSpeaker 10: So if, for example, we designate a certain area that we would allow scooters, but only at a reduced speed. And you may know this, but for the audience, under California law, they are now capped at 15 miles an hour.\nSpeaker 10: So if we had a congested zone, we were okay with scooters as a micro-mobility option. And but we only wanted them to go half that. So seven or eight miles an hour, we would be looking for vendors that had that level of technology.\nSpeaker 10: So we would only issue permits under this adopted program to companies that could could comply with all aspects of the program, A and then B would also, which would include certain levels of technology for for this deployment.\nSpeaker 8: That's that's really great to hear. I also know that scooters are not supposed to be ridden on roads where the miles per hour speed limit is 25 or higher, but that the city has the option to raise that to 35 miles per hour to allow scooters to go on those roads.\nSpeaker 8: I just want to go on record as saying that I would absolutely object to allowing them on streets where it's 35 miles per hour or higher, because as our traffic engineer sitting next to Director Beck will attest, once we get to speeds of 35 miles per hour or higher, a collision between a car and someone on a\nSpeaker 8: scooter can result in great bodily injury or death at a much higher rate at 35 miles per hour or higher than at 25 miles per hour. So I don't know if you have any thoughts on that or if there's any.\nSpeaker 8: Any way that we can, you know, require the geofencing technology to limit the scooters from even being used on roads that are higher than 25 miles per hour.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember Price Thank you for that question. Eric Wood Strand City Traffic Engineer Just to address the concerns about higher scooter usage on higher speed streets, that's one of the reasons why we want to install more bike infrastructure. And I think some of these fees are applied.\nSpeaker 2: We want to use them for infrastructure so that we can get scooter riders off of the sidewalk riding on facilities that are safe and not in of not interfering or coming in conflict with conflict with cars.\nSpeaker 8: And what about this? Can we limit? Can we use the technology to limit them from getting on roads that are 35 miles per hour?\nSpeaker 10: So I want to add and make sure that we're speaking the same. So some roads in the city, we have what we call SROs, which is an opportunity for a vehicle and a bicycle to share the same lane.\nSpeaker 10: We have other roads in the city where you have a designated bike lane and a designated vehicle lane. What we were trying to stress is we didn't want scooters on roads that had SROs in them that were above 25 miles an hour.\nSpeaker 10: But thinking about E-Scooters as a mobility option, as we know that the opportunity for student housing in and around Cal State Long Beach as an example is minimal. And we have student housing across the city, which is why we're trying to make linkages for our bicycle infrastructure directly to the university.\nSpeaker 10: And that includes Bellflower Street, where we recently completed a separated bike lane. We do believe it would be appropriate for a micromobility unit that could be an e-scooter and or an e-bike to be in that separated bike lane on Bellflower, even though we know those speeds exceed 25 miles an hour.\nSpeaker 10: So I think the real focus is safe riding and we certainly wouldn't want an e-scooter in a vehicle lane on any street where the where the vehicle speeds are that high.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. Will the technology be able to cater the device to meet those parameters, those safety parameters?\nSpeaker 10: I don't know specifically if that's available or not. That would be something. We'll have to check with the scooter companies.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. I'd appreciate if we could talk about that when it comes back in that six month mark as well, just to get a check in. And that raises another issue that maybe is better for the city attorney. But what what is the issue of liability for the city?\nSpeaker 8: I know the staff report addresses that in terms of waivers. Do those waivers absolve the city of liability entirely should a collision occur?\nSpeaker 2: I wish that were true. I think that the we have had our experiences. We have several claims currently in being investigated in our claim section that have not currently resulted in litigation. If the if the claims process doesn't resolve it and a lawsuit was filed, we would be tendering that to the scooter company to defend or or\nSpeaker 2: protect the city's interests. And we are counting on those companies to honor their agreements with the city. We haven't had that yet. We've also been served. We have not been served. But I've seen that a lawsuit has been filed.\nSpeaker 2: A class action lawsuit has been filed against the city of Long Beach and several other cities. And I believe it's Bird alleging ADA violations with the devices blocking path of travel and access issues. We have not, as I said, we have not been served with that litigation.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not sure on where that is. Bird may have more information, but if once we are served with that, we'll be tendering that to Bird to defend the city's interests in that. Also.\nSpeaker 8: Under if we were to adopt a new ordinance that establishes a permanent program, will that be a part of the ordinance, as you understand it, such that the the providers will be responsible for any claims filed against?\nSpeaker 2: That's correct. Obviously, you know, if it was if whatever happened was caused by the negligence of the city, then the city that we wouldn't ask them to defend that. But if it's a what we're considering a traditional use and someone falls and it wasn't caused by any negligence of the city, we.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, they would usually the city and the scooter company are sued and we would look to the scooter company to defend the city.\nSpeaker 6: Okay.\nSpeaker 8: That's great information. Thank you. I know a lot of my residents were interested in that.\nSpeaker 6: Okay.\nSpeaker 8: Other than that, I don't really have any questions. I want to. Any other questions I want to hear from my colleagues. But specifically, I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on the number that are released. And of course, I'm very supportive of a citywide release as my council colleague, Councilmember Pearce, mentioned.\nSpeaker 8: You know, we want to make sure that at least they're being retrieved throughout the city, even though there might be dropped off in other out of that zone. We want that availability so that they're not all that the heaviest burden isn't on the coastal regions.\nSpeaker 8: So thank you very much for your information and for this report. It was fantastic.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Good questions, Vice Mayor Andrews.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, very good questions. And thank you, Ms.. Fish, for bringing this to the agenda to the guys tonight, because I think we've all heard some very good comments tonight. And to me personally, you know, I'd like to see a number of the vendors reduce from programs to, you know, from 2 to 3, because I know the staff\nSpeaker 5: is always working at a capacity and and it takes that sort of, you know, time to sort out vendors and scooters, you know, capabilities. You know, I would say that I've only met with two or three of these vendors and they met with me.\nSpeaker 5: And the care and the concern they have for my residents have reached out to my office, you know, with a very, you know, positive concern. And I'm very appreciative of that. But in my district, you know, the priorities I have heard are not leaving these scooters outside of the nest and making them affordable.\nSpeaker 5: So I appreciate the efforts and working with low income families. You know, I think that we need to work on education for these those that do not use the scooters so they'll know who to call when they run into these issues on the scooters.\nSpeaker 5: And I want them to work and cooperate with this moving forward as possible. And lastly, I thought that, you know, those that are with the decals in which people are supposed to leave the scooters, you know, standing, do not work.\nSpeaker 5: So we need to come up with that parking incentive, you know, for the locations concerned. But most of that, I really do. I support it. I support the item. And I hope everything will go well with this. And thank you again very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews. Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 13: Thank you. I really appreciate all the comments and dialog we've had on this. I have had the most interesting conversations, whether I'm on a business tour at the grocery store or anywhere, and we've also had a lot of comments on Facebook.\nSpeaker 13: So with that, I want to kind of bring together I think the comments from my residents have varied, but I believe that many of their concerns would be remediated if we could, one, keep the scooters off the sidewalks.\nSpeaker 13: Are we stating that you would need to deploy technology to either keep them off the sidewalk or allow people to report the sidewalk violations the way that some of the scooter companies have in their app to be eligible in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 10: So to clarify, right now, the gas technology does not exist. Excuse me. Or gas for that matter. That would allow us to restrict driving on a sidewalk through technology. However, it is in the vehicle code, it's not allowed.\nSpeaker 10: And we could be looking at enhanced enforcement and education to ensure people understand that is not legal.\nSpeaker 13: So currently there are some providers who allow you to or are about to deploy technology that allow you to take a picture of a violator. And they would supposedly know which scooter that was at that time. Are we going to require that in the deployment of this?\nSpeaker 10: I think we would encourage that through the rate structure and additionally beyond the take a picture of a bad rider. Also, if a scooter was inappropriately parked. So if, for example, I have.\nSpeaker 13: Those coming next is.\nSpeaker 6: Parked ahead of us.\nSpeaker 13: So just on the on the scooting part. So if people are scooting on the sidewalks riding and they're turned in, we could require the companies fine the participant before allowing them to rent another scooter.\nSpeaker 10: That's correct. We could put that into our permanent program.\nSpeaker 13: I would be encouraging that. Is that something that friendly that would be accepted for staff to explore and include in the final document? Thank you. Required no parking zones. So we were talking about the technology to deploy and we're requiring that of any participant on a go forward basis.\nSpeaker 13: What's the full anyone that's applying for the permit, they would have to have the ability to do no parking zones in the zones we determine.\nSpeaker 10: Correct.\nSpeaker 13: Perfect. Ensuring their return to their proper places. So I know that some cities have a return to base incentive where their the return to certain places. The writers are incentivized with like a dollar to put them back. But I'm also really interested in a fine for noncompliance, because I'm understanding that not everyone are encouraged by incentives.\nSpeaker 13: And so right now you have a fine structure for impounding. But I'm interested in something in kind of in the line of Councilwoman Price's idea. When we impound it, we take a scooter off the street, then we have to haul it back to City Hall, and then we have to allow the companies to come get their impounded\nSpeaker 13: scooter back from us. I'd like the impound to be a little bit more. Varied in terms of if it's been there for 2 hours and a city staff member or our compliance officer has to go out and get that scooter instead of bringing it back to City Hall and then incurring the costs to the scooter companies of\nSpeaker 13: $25 a day. I would say we should be able to give the $100 impound fee and then we could just return it to the location. And I think that $100 is important because it needs to be a disincentive for the companies to allow us to do it.\nSpeaker 13: Some providers have people who go out and do that all the time and their costs are far below $100 per movement. And so I think that keeping it at the same hundred dollars would be a mechanism for encouraging that.\nSpeaker 10: Certainly, I think your rebalancing idea is is worthy. I think we would still want an impounding fee.\nSpeaker 13: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 10: If if, in fact, people don't comply with their their approved number. Oh, absolutely. I agree. There's no reason to have it travel back and forth. If we can simply rebalance it and address the fine through a binding structure, we can include that when we return to the ordinance.\nSpeaker 13: And then finally, I think that the component that the community really talks about is mobility is nothing without the ability to continue to walk. And so that kind of is covered in our sidewalks side, but also a lot of the revenue sharing models, money goes into sidewalk repair to adding to the mobility of our communities.\nSpeaker 13: And so my friendly amendment would be in keeping in mind what Councilwoman Pearce said and then also in discussions with the companies about how they determine deployment based on upfront costs versus ongoing costs. I'd like to do the following as an option for for revenue sharing of $0.10 per ride with a minimum $15 per month per scooter\nSpeaker 13: due quarterly or $0.05 per paid ride with a minimum of $5 per month due quarterly for senior friendly scooters or low income scooter riders. So your low income scooter riders or your senior scooter riders would be at the lower rate so that there's an incentive to put those in the communities that are.\nSpeaker 13: Lower. Ridership, let's say. So what that does is it takes the $120 a year and it spreads it over the entire year. So if they wanted to deploy, let's say, 400 scooters, they wouldn't have to have all that upfront cost.\nSpeaker 13: Because I heard from some of the scooter companies, it would be better for them if it was spread out because then they don't have that same kind of cost up front.\nSpeaker 10: So, Councilmember, just if I could, what I heard you say was we would charge a ten cent per ride. Cost with a minimum of $15 a month per unit. So if that unit didn't generate enough rides at $0.10 a ride to create a $15 a month fee.\nSpeaker 13: So what it does is it really takes it makes it $150 a year spread over.\nSpeaker 10: Would be it would be more than that.\nSpeaker 13: Oh, let's make it $10 a month, $120, $120 a year at $10 a month. So that's your base fee that you were thinking.\nSpeaker 2: Of as is still part of your motion? I need. Yes. We need some clarity here. Yes. You got to help me. It's a.\nSpeaker 13: Friendly.\nSpeaker 0: Amendment. I think right now it's a it's a friendly amendment discussion about this idea.\nSpeaker 13: So I'm trying to get it so that they'll still deploy the scooters because there was a discussion that there's no incentive. Don't deploy them around Long Beach City College because the ridership is low. And so if they had to pay $120 upfront to deploy them, they wouldn't be interested in doing that.\nSpeaker 13: But the students there feel that it's important. So what I was trying to do, and in discussions with some of the providers, I stated, well, what if that was $10 a month? It's still a $120 a year to the city, which allows us to pay for our compliance officer, which is really important because I can't I cannot\nSpeaker 13: support this without compliance. But it doesn't make the scooter companies who are deploying 1500 scooters have to walk into city hall with their $25,000 plus thousands of dollars. It just kind of puts it over a greater timeline. And they had stated in some of their discussions that that's very helpful to them because they're trying to deploy scooters\nSpeaker 13: , 10,000 scooters in L.A. and 2500, 2500 scooters in Santa monica. And there's only so many scooters and so much budget for deployment. So I was just trying to be helpful.\nSpeaker 10: So could could I offer maybe a suggestion?\nSpeaker 13: I would love a.\nSpeaker 10: Suggestion to address what I believe you're trying to get to. So we talked earlier about a discounted per unit cost in our low income communities, and we talked about using the census data to be able to deploy and understand how those would be applied.\nSpeaker 10: It wouldn't be a stretch if council wanted to designate high priority areas to also have that fee. So for example, if Long Beach City College was designated by this Council as a high priority area, we could then only charge the $40 rate per unit at those high priority areas as designated by this council.\nSpeaker 10: So that would be an alternative.\nSpeaker 13: That's very helpful.\nSpeaker 10: And I'm also very open to having the fees paid over time instead of everything upfront. So if it's easier for deployment of the scooter companies, maybe a quarterly payment structure or something, if it needs to be monthly, we can go there.\nSpeaker 10: I would prefer not to have to collect monthly.\nSpeaker 13: I don't want to collect monthly.\nSpeaker 10: More staff were.\nSpeaker 13: Collected quarterly, but the idea would be that it's spread out over time.\nSpeaker 10: Certainly open to that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 13: So I would like staff to look into that and bring back what they believe to be in discussion with the scooter companies equitable and deployable, and for them to determine for us where those priority areas are. So in the heat map that I saw, there were certain areas that drove directly along City College and directly out, and\nSpeaker 13: the neighbors around Long Beach City College really appreciated that because there was a reduction in cars coming in and out of the campus during those hours and a reduction in people who are parking in the neighborhoods versus on campus because parking on our college sites has become so expensive.\nSpeaker 13: So I would appreciate that. I'd also be interested in deputizing individuals to be compliance officers on an incentive program, because what I fear is for us to start hiring all these staff members. There's a lot of need. And so kind of in the same.\nSpeaker 13: Idea that they have the Chargers or the juicers or whatever they're called, depending on your your company. I would be interested in a long term solution where we incentivize either business associations or others, but I don't know what that technology looks like, so I just kind of like to throw it out there for you to think about\nSpeaker 13: in the future before you come back to this council asking for a third and fourth compliance officer, but knowing that we can't survive without really strong compliance and we're going to need to rely on the people who are already there all the time.\nSpeaker 13: It's kind of like people are always obeying the law when the cops are there. If we had deputized community members, it might be helpful. I appreciate the revised emblems of the drop zones. That was something we had a lot of complaints about and in my request, I support that.\nSpeaker 13: As the funding comes in. It would first fund the compliance officer and then apportionment of future revenues into both sidewalk repair and the second staff member that public works has created or requested. And I think that really covers a lot of the concerns.\nSpeaker 13: I know I spoke quickly. I know it's getting late, but I appreciate everyone's time and input on this because I think it's really important to balance the needs of certain populations with the needs of other populations, to still maintain the ability to walk around our own community and not have these obstructions in our way.\nSpeaker 13: So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I'm going to do my best to keep my questions short. I do appreciate all of the thoughtful questions already presented by my colleagues, and I appreciate staff's work on on this this issue. Obviously, this is a new new market, new technology.\nSpeaker 3: And I want to say that I think I'm one of the more supportive council members, although I haven't had the the level of complaints coming from my residents. And so I'm sensitive to those who have, I think, because this is such a new, new motto, I've mentioned this before, I think we need to maintain our flexibility as\nSpeaker 3: as policy makers and as a council, because this is an evolving business model. You know, things have improved in in technologies that change just during the pilot period that we have experienced here in our in our city. And we have to recognize that that these e-scooters are serving the mobility needs of the public.\nSpeaker 3: There is a demand for them people. We've heard public testimony here today. Individuals are using them to transport to to work as transportation, to work school. And and I'm for one, one of those individuals with with teenagers. I wouldn't I have a teenage son, 16 years, 17 years old, who's driving a car.\nSpeaker 3: I would much prefer him being on a scooter, going to or from school. So the age limit, I think, is a little restrictive for for that to happen. But but I think we need to be thinking broader here because, again, there are a number of school age children, high school children who are who are driving cars.\nSpeaker 3: And we should be looking to reduce our greenhouse gases of the vendors proposed. I did have a couple of questions. I know I heard from staff you wanted to use up to four in the data that has been presented in a staff report shows that really three are really in high demand.\nSpeaker 3: I'm curious to know what what methodology and what goes into the reasoning for up to four providers.\nSpeaker 10: So Councilmember, when we really think about Long Beach and how we would potentially deploy in Long Beach. We know that while we have some good operators in our city, that there are other operators out there that aren't or haven't been part of the pilot program that may express interest in being in our city.\nSpeaker 10: And we want to make sure that we have an opportunity to work with them if they can meet all of our requirements and are a good operator. So we think that maybe four is the right number, maybe ultimately that shrinks, but we didn't want to be too restrictive as we start our pilot program moving forward.\nSpeaker 3: Well, I think this is all about we want to promote competitiveness and we want to complete report. I mean, I'm sorry. And I've heard from several my colleagues, you want to promote compliance and the best actors, those who are and we've had a history of doing this before in other industries.\nSpeaker 3: If if the the E-Scooter provider is being a good actor is doing all that we've asked them to do is being working with us, working with the public works department, listening and being responsive to the to the council offices and business districts.\nSpeaker 3: I think they need to be rewarded. And so I think that that needs to be taken in the serious consideration when awarding the contracts. I would only support contracting only with the scooter companies that have, you know, shown to be most responsive and who have shown that there is a real demand for their services at that.\nSpeaker 3: I can also say that that in the north part of the city and Councilmember Pearce referenced that again and it might be a correlation with the complaints. We haven't received the complaints, but we don't. See as many scooters in our areas.\nSpeaker 3: And that could be for a number of reasons, be it lack of bike infrastructure. And I know we're working toward doing that, but or the the business districts where they're there, there isn't really any where to to ride because it's only sidewalk specific anyway.\nSpeaker 3: And I think we do need to also keeping in mind the safety of our pedestrians. And so we don't see as many. And so the other question I had is why and what goes into the number for the 6000 scooter deployment plan?\nSpeaker 3: Why 6000 and and would 4000 suffices for for for the first six months?\nSpeaker 10: I'm certainly stats ready to implement whatever this council adopts. We're proposing 6000 if the council believes 4000 is a better number. We're certainly ready and willing to implement that number.\nSpeaker 3: So help me out. Well, why 6000? What would what's moving that number?\nSpeaker 10: So if we were to adopt four vendors, the vendors have shared with us that they need more scooters on the street to be able to to to address profitability for operating in Long Beach. We certainly appreciate that. They've been working with us with a limited number during our pilot program.\nSpeaker 10: But we're told somewhere between 1002 thousand is a regular deployment for a scooter vendor. So if you did four vendors at 1500 splitting a thousand or 2000, that's 6000. That's how we came up with the number.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Well, I would as I again, I'm very supportive of E-Scooters, but also, like I said, sensitive to some of the concerns raised by my colleagues as well as their residents. I think we need to like many other things that we do in this city, we need to take a phased in approach.\nSpeaker 3: And so I support a 4000 number, and I think that's fair. And again, really, really scrutinizing and vetting are these contractors to the vendors in terms of their ability to comply with the needs that have been expressed by the council here.\nSpeaker 3: I think the other big issue in front of us is the the fee structure. The per unit fee is interesting. We're proposing or staff has proposed $120 per unit. And that is that would raise up to half a million dollars.\nSpeaker 3: Is that a one time fee per unit or is it a annual fee?\nSpeaker 10: Staff is proposing an annual fee. There's two components. It would be a permit fee annually at 25,000 and a per unit cost of $120 per unit annually.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And then the discount for low income areas being $40. How will the low income area be defined? I think Councilmember Pearce touched on this a little bit. I'm kind of trying to understand what is it going to be, a census block number, if it's.\nSpeaker 3: Is it going to be?\nSpeaker 10: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: So how do you put that on a unit?\nSpeaker 10: So in my example, we currently have divided the city in what we're calling three zones. So we'll just say in zone one, if we looked at all the census tracts in Zone one, if 30% of those census tracts qualified as low income census tracts based on HUD information, which we have that data available to us, then anybody\nSpeaker 10: that deployed in Zone one would get 30% of those units at the discounted number. That's what I'm proposing. As staff, we're certainly open to other interpretations of how this might go. But that's kind of how we, we believed, would be the best approach.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Well, I think that that clarifies a few of the questions I had. Again, I just want to express my my support. I do think this is a new mobility option that is important for for our future in getting people out of cars, introducing new mobility.\nSpeaker 3: I don't see an electric scooter much differently than I do a skateboard or or a bicycle. In a lot of ways, there are clean options and alternatives to to to to to get around our city. I do understand the challenges.\nSpeaker 3: This is something new. But when you look at the data that has been produced already, it shows that that that the the the E-SCOOTER program is actually meeting its its intent when you can read that 1.2 miles of average distance, you know, these were introduced into the model was first last mile options for individuals.\nSpeaker 3: And then again I do appreciate Mr. Sand. I can't say coming in and talking about, you know, being a commuter or a user of this this this mode for to get to and from work and how it has saved him over, over, over time.\nSpeaker 3: And so I think there's there's options for for us to improve this. I think coming back after six months is something that I can support because I think I do think it would require some some regular check ins, as you said, Mr. Beck.\nSpeaker 3: And and again, as a council, we need to just just be be flexible and nimble with with this this move in policy, because there will be some changes moving forward. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. Come to my city council meeting.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Very, very robust discussion. A lot of good ideas thrown out there. And I think that from what I've seen in the staff report, that to commend staff for coming up with a lot of good ideas here and it shows that they've been listening, especially when one of the comments that I had previously on this first\nSpeaker 2: came up to us was about safety videos and that requirement that that would help the city when it when you're looking at people having to sign a liability and indemnification waivers because if you don't see a video, what what does that what does a site liability release do anyway?\nSpeaker 2: So anyway, I'm very pleased that you're you're looking at dotting some some I's and crossing some T's on this. My whole discussion on this basically is that any approach that we use that is measured as strategic is a good approach.\nSpeaker 2: I mean, we need to look at it very carefully. As my fellow colleagues have already stated, it's new technology and it's a new program. And it's and it's something that we are being confronted with that has new different types of approaches to it and new challenges.\nSpeaker 2: Then, of course, like everything else, when you have a chance, you have an opportunity. So here's an opportunity for us to review this more carefully, more major league, more strategically, to make sure that once we do adapt, adopt a program into the future, that it's one that's going to work for us.\nSpeaker 2: We always talked about the Long Beach way. Well, here's an opportunity to do it again for the long doing it. The Long Beach way and it's always the Long Beach way is going to be the right way and that's what we want.\nSpeaker 2: One of the other concerns that I have and it was brought up, but it hasn't really been discussed. One of our public commentators mentioned the fact that there are sometimes you see these scooters, people riding scooters that impact, if you will, three or four or five at a time.\nSpeaker 2: And that might lead to raise a red flag in regards to that, each one of those scooter riders rent that scooter alone, or was there one individual using a credit card that rented all those five scooters for that for all those five individuals?\nSpeaker 2: And I see that one of the one of the pie charts in the in the report indicates that although there's 14% under age, I tend to disagree with that. I see. I mean, most most scooter riders that I've seen have been definitely under age and definitely not following the rules and definitely not wearing helmets.\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, there's something that we have to look at in terms of when these scooters are being rented. Are they being rented responsibly by individuals who have signed the liability waiver? By people who have seen the. Safety videos by people who have helped.\nSpeaker 2: So those are my concerns. But again, this is a pilot program. We're moving forward. And I think that the vendors are listening to us. They're hearing our concerns. And and staff has certainly been listening to and hearing our concerns, as I see in this report.\nSpeaker 2: So moving forward, I'm looking to towards what we develop for very near future. I'm not going to raise any new concerns. I think the staff has been doing an adequate and phenomenal job in studying this very carefully. And I want to also throw a shout out to the vendors for cooperating with us and trying to address every\nSpeaker 2: concern that we've raised before them. And they are responding. Other than that, let's that look forward to what comes out in the next six months. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Superman.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. The fourth district has received a number of complaints, and I think the number one complaint is scooters on the sidewalk. And Craig Peck, you mentioned that you're looking for alternatives to drop zones or as the bird company very cleverly calls them, nest.\nSpeaker 5: The irony to me is that our number one complaint is that scooters are on the sidewalks, yet the drop zones are on sidewalks. So technically you have to violate the law to get the scooter out of the drop zone.\nSpeaker 5: So I think your point is very well taken that we ought to look at alternatives to that and also the litigation that Mr. Parking mentioned, scooters interfering with ADA access. So that's what I'm glad you brought it up and I'd like to see that pursued a brand new issue for the first time today was brought to my\nSpeaker 5: attention so I have to blindside staff with this is dismantled scooters I've got complaints on that today. I hadn't seen it before, but I was reminded of the great legislation that Councilwoman Pryce brought about in 2017 when bicycle parts became currency.\nSpeaker 5: So I'd like to keep an eye on this to make sure that we don't have a black market on scooter parts moving forward. Oh, okay. Yeah. And, Mr. Parkin, maybe we could take a look to see if our existing ordinance already includes that, or it could be altered to look at that.\nSpeaker 5: Also, for the city attorney, the legal liabilities. I certainly don't want to invite any lawsuits. But you had mentioned that there are cases where the city would be liable in in certain instances. And if I know you can't comment or probably don't want to comment on pending litigation, but could you give us some ideas for how we\nSpeaker 5: might be proactive and prevent those types of situations?\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilmember I think that in dealing with the scooters. The work is done on the front end with our agreements with the vendors who are selected to be provide the scooters in the city of Long Beach with our agreements on indemnity and in our waiver documents that the scooters have the user sign.\nSpeaker 2: So that's that's our first step. The others obviously then would be the street maintenance if we have them in the bike lanes. Obviously, if they you know, we're talking about making sure that all of those are maintained as the city does.\nSpeaker 2: And so it's just a it's just another mode of transportation in the city generally has litigation dealing with all types of mobility and transportation.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Thank you. Then to the item of 4000 versus 6000 scooters. I wonder if staff could comment on if, let's say we chose 6000 scooters as the number. How long would it take to ramp up to that number of scooters actually in existence in the city?\nSpeaker 10: Well, Councilmember, the best way I can answer that, I think it depends on the company. And we know there are companies that have inventory available to deploy right away and others would probably rely on on adding to their inventory to be able to deploy that number.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. So would it be safe to say that if we chose the number of 4000, would it be. And maybe you can answer this. Would it be months before we got up to that number or you just don't know?\nSpeaker 10: Well, first things first. We have to finalize the ordinance, bring it back to this council, have the council adopt the ordinance, and then we would be able to go through an application process, get to an approved vendor, and then get to those deployment numbers.\nSpeaker 10: So nothing is going to happen overnight. We're not going to go from our current deployment to 4000 in a night or a week. So, yeah, I would say weeks and maybe months.\nSpeaker 5: To get there. Right. So my point being that we would get a lot of data back before we ever reach those top numbers, I would suspect, I think finally. Well, second last question is that application fee. It just strikes me if you could just give the public any indication why that doesn't apply here and maybe why Oakland's\nSpeaker 5: it is $2,500.\nSpeaker 10: Are you asking the question of why staff is recommending a $25,000 option?\nSpeaker 5: No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. So down here for for Oakland, we have 20 $500 for an application fee. And Long Beach is not applicable. It's right up your chart.\nSpeaker 10: Yes, I can. I can address that. So we believe that an application for you is redundant and that a permit process and a permit fee should include anything related to the application process.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Think, you know, I will be asked that question. So that's why I am asking you tonight. And finally, I'd just like to say our council Mungo's idea about deputizing compliance officers. There are few folks who lodge a lot of complaints with our office, so I think I'll have some volunteers right off the bat for that.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: That's that's true. Councilman Kendall.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. Thanks so much for all of the work and to my colleagues in their discussions. So I think with the revenue that we receive from this, I do believe the compliance officer, I think from hearing from everyone and certainly in my district, the compliance officer is a big deal.\nSpeaker 4: I would just like to know again on the liability, I have seen different cities potentially being sued on the ADR issue and if there's any update, city attorney parking. Can we just get a two from four on any sort of issue related to that, though?\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. As I indicated, we are aware that a case has been filed, but we have not been served. As soon as we get that, we will forward that up to the council.\nSpeaker 4: And that is the main issue in my district that I'm hearing. People that are using wheelchairs and I have someone who is in my office, uses a wheelchair and has issues going home every single day from City Hall to her house in Wilmore.\nSpeaker 4: So take very much issue with that. And then of course, safety, which is also very, very important. I know we're addressing a lot of those kind of moving along to the business improvement districts, as Councilmember Mongo mentioned. I don't know about deputizing necessarily, but I think that what I can foresee some of our business improvement districts doing\nSpeaker 4: is maybe asking for additional funding or, you know, to be a part of the process somehow in enforcing. Or I know in downtown they ask, you know, we do pedestrian data work along Pine Avenue. So I can see that kind of being a thing down the road.\nSpeaker 4: So I just want us to be prepared for that as this evolves, as this program evolves. And I also like the phased in approach as well. I think specific specifically with an emphasis on vendors who have the technology.\nSpeaker 4: And I hope that as this evolves, the other vendors, if we're working on two or three or four, that other vendors will upgrade their technology to have more capacity for data. And then as far as the had one last question with our Parklets, I know we had talked about a compliance officer with revenues we would receive.\nSpeaker 4: Would we be paying for Parklets or is that going to be parklets included in the revenue that we receive or what are we looking at down the road?\nSpeaker 10: So, Councilmember Gonzalez. Yes, I think the goal would be that the city would install certain parklets for specifically for either bikeshare e-bike or E-Scooter parking. And wherever we identify those that would be used from revenues from micromobility to pay for it.\nSpeaker 4: Okay, great. And then just another side note, because I know that a lot of food vendors sort of in the gig economy utilize scooter these e-scooters. So I'm wondering what type of outreach could be done, whether it's through the vendors directly or from us or in collaboration?\nSpeaker 4: Because you think about Postmates, I mean, these are just rampant in in our city and many of them are encouraged to use e-scooter scooters. So I think there could be some sort of outreach we could do or perhaps just recommend to the vendors to do that.\nSpeaker 4: I'm sure they're doing that already, perhaps. And that is it. And thank you so much for the presentation.\nSpeaker 0: Council member Pearce.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you and thank you to all our colleagues for a fruitful discussion. I want to just kind of recap. I heard compliance officers absolutely support that. I would I'm anxious about deputizing residents. I just want to say that that seems like a very no no.\nSpeaker 7: We could get neighbors yelling at each other and it could just not be great. So if it's about the business improvement districts playing that role, that's something that I fully support, that I support the four companies. I had an idea while sitting here and I don't know if the companies could do something like it, but a helmet\nSpeaker 7: incentive, you can take pictures of where the the scooter is. If you take a picture of yourself with a helmet, could you get 50, $0.50 off your ride or. We know it's not law anymore, but anything that we could do to try to incentivize people wearing helmets, I think looking at the data, seeing that we have had\nSpeaker 7: that had injuries, I think is an interesting one. So I think that the two big questions for me, one is that I would like to have staff come back. The fee per scooter. I heard at least two of my other council colleagues trying to address this.\nSpeaker 7: And I just I'm going to rely on you on staff that's done this work because you guys know it best. But really hearing that we're trying to balance the needs and making sure that people get on scooters and whether that's a phased in approach, knowing that we're going to put these in parts of the city that haven't\nSpeaker 7: had them, we don't want to deter people from getting on them. And so I just want to make sure that that's something across the board. And if we had one fee, like $60 or $70 across the board, that that would take away all the work of trying to identify the low income areas and the school zones and\nSpeaker 7: LBC or Cal State, Long Beach that if it just was across the board. So I'm going to ask you guys to come back with something that you think is reasonable and not try to dictate that from the floor here.\nSpeaker 7: And then I wanted to ask on deployment, understanding that that's going to take a long time. I know there was conversation around 4000 versus 6000. Could we say 4000 deployed in areas first that are not high impact areas currently?\nSpeaker 10: Again, staffs ready to implement whatever this council passes this evening. I think not speaking on behalf of the scooter companies, but they would be looking at a distributed model where they could rely on their commonly used areas to supplement as they march out into areas that maybe they haven't deployed in yet.\nSpeaker 10: So I think being overly too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak, being overly cumbersome in how we detail what this ordinance would be. I think we want to rely on the private marketplace.\nSpeaker 7: Point received. Point received. I know that there was a friendly on the floor for 4000. If everybody here is comfortable with 4000 starting, I'm good. But I wanted to make sure that we didn't take away from areas that don't have them.\nSpeaker 7: And so that's what I was trying to get out a phased approach, 4000, then adding the other two. So I'm very happy that you guys are working on this ordinance, happy that we're at the place that we're at.\nSpeaker 0: So I want to make sure I'm clear on on the motion on that last piece. Maybe you're the same. I just want to make sure. Councilmember Pier So your motion is to do 4000, not 6000. Is that motion and to just when you said a phased in approach, you want to phase them in.\nSpeaker 0: How so? So six months have review to go up to 6000.\nSpeaker 7: As a pro scooter person. I love 6000, but I, I recognize that there's a friendly on the floor, so I want to be respectful of that. So I get 4,001st, right?\nSpeaker 0: And so I just want to clarify. So basically it would do 4000 for that six months after the review, we could go up to the additional 6000 depending on the review. Exactly. Okay. Thank you. Got to make sure I heard that correct.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Parking is that we got that? Yes.\nSpeaker 2: I think just for point, clarification, if we are directed this evening to go prepare the ordinance, would you want the 4000 for the six months? And then it would automatically go to six unless directed by the council at six months.\nSpeaker 2: Or do you want it to come back and you just just automatically go up?\nSpeaker 7: It automatically go up, please. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: And then if I may, after hearing the council's comments this evening, if we could hold off on adopting the fees so that we can adjust that, and if it passes this evening, we will bring back the ordinance and the fee resolution at the same time so that we're doing them together that way.\nSpeaker 7: Perfect.\nSpeaker 2: We get some clarity because there's been a lot of different discussion here, and I'm not sure I have it right.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And I just want to make sure, Mr. Modica, just from a from a fee schedule with the state attorney just said a word with that process on, I just want to make sure that I know that the fee part is is critical to rolling out the projects and the enforcement piece.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is. But we would that's more of a technicality. We would like to bring back the fee. Will we notice it for a hearing? And we would put that fee into place. So a chance they're going to come back with that.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: But that's I'm fine. Count. No, that's it. Okay. I think we've answered all the questions. We have a motion in a second on the floor, please. Members, cast your votes.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think that was a good discussion. Good resolution. So appreciate appreciate that. So I have public comment next. I just have a request right now, Councilman Manganese, to go do some some other duties, according to her.\nSpeaker 0: And so she's asked that we hear 18 and 19 really quick and then do public comment, which I'm going to watch, I'm fine with. So can we just hear item 18 and then 19, please?\n",

        "source": "Speaker 6: Good evening to you, sir, with community planning and development. This is a rezoning of property located at 4800 North Ray Street. It is proposed to be reasoned from I.B., an industrial zone district you are to which is an overlay allowing billboards to seem x three, cm x five and c MSA which is urban center mixed use three\nSpeaker 6: , five and eight story. So the property is located in central north central Denver in the Elyria Swansea neighborhood. Oops, I went the wrong way. And it is about 264,000 square feet or six acres. There is an existing warehouse, industrial warehouse on the property.\nSpeaker 6: The property owner is requesting to rezone to redevelop the site. And again, the request is to go from I.B., which is an industrial zone district use overlay to which allows which creates an allowance for billboards to urban center mixed use three stories, five stories and eight stories.\nSpeaker 6: So as I said before, it's in the Elyria Swansea, a neighborhood three blocks east of Brighton Boulevard and the National Western Transit Station that will be built two blocks north of Interstate 70. And two blocks west of York Street.\nSpeaker 6: Current zoning is that industrial zone zoning. Current use is an industrial use. It is a 1 to 2 storey industrial warehouse that is within a half mile of the National Western Stock Show and Transit Station. So existing context, the zoning is surrounded on the north by that industrial zone district, a city park to the west, and a\nSpeaker 6: recreational recreation center, and then two unit zoning to the south predominantly. So again, existing industrial land use mostly to the north and residential to the south across 48th Avenue. This gives you an idea of what the property looks like.\nSpeaker 6: It is a huge warehouse at this point. Bottom picture is the residential to the south. Picture on the right is the Park City Park. And then the industrial land uses. So this was that planning board on March 16th and was recommended unanimously to support the rezoning.\nSpeaker 6: It was a neighborhood plan and planning committee on April 6th and passed out of committee then. So we are here for the public hearing that has been properly noticed. These are all of the RINO's that were notified of this hearing.\nSpeaker 6: We have no R.A. letters, but one letter of opposition that should be in your packet. The last page of your packet. So the plans that apply our plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and the Illyria Sponsor Your Neighborhoods Plan that was adopted in 2015.\nSpeaker 6: Blueprint Denver Land use concept is transit oriented development because of the proximity to the station. It is within that half mile, if I hadn't said that before. And our transit oriented development in Blueprint Denver should be a balanced mix of uses and mid to high density development.\nSpeaker 6: And of course, it's an area of change where.\nSpeaker 0: Citywide.\nSpeaker 6: We want to direct growth. So the Elyria Swansea Neighborhoods Plan did amend areas of change, but not for this property. So it is remains in an area of change. It is remains in the transit oriented development land use type in the Elyria Swansea, a plan.\nSpeaker 6: And it does give us more direction on the heights of the development on the property. You'll notice it is three, five and eight stories, the same as being proposed. So this diagram gives you a little bit of information on how we.\nSpeaker 6: Drew the lines of where the three, five and eight story should occur. Basically, we tried to treat the property as if it were next door to a protected zone district, because that's the gist of what the Elyria Swansea plan wanted us to do.\nSpeaker 6: Step down to the existing residential on the south side of 48th Avenue. So we started at the front property line as if it were directly adjacent to a protected zone district. We went back the 25 feet. That would be a step back in if it were a protected district and then up the three stories.\nSpeaker 6: Then we went for a 175 feet back from the line. That is the actual boundary between the protected zone district and the property. And that's another standard in the zoning code that within 175 feet of a protected zone district, you can't be higher than a certain height.\nSpeaker 6: So we use that horizontal distance as the five story height, and then the remainder of the property is the eight storey height. So with that, staff finds that this application is consistent with the applicable neighborhood plans and that we will further the uniformity of district regulations by sticking with our regular zoned districts.\nSpeaker 6: And we are, by implementing our plans, furthering the public's health, safety and welfare, justifying circumstances changed conditions. The property will be redeveloping with a new owner. It is located in an area of change within half mile of a trans, a new transit station and the redeveloping National Western Center.\nSpeaker 6: The local plan does call for it to rezone or redevelop from industrial to transit oriented development, industrial mixed use and then still accommodate the industrial in the neighborhood. So we believe this is a correct justifying circumstance. And with that, staff recommends approval.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. We have seven speakers signed up. I'm going to call up the first five. You can make your way up to the front pew and you can begin your remarks. Toni Pickett. Nolan McGill. Kirby Battelle. Candy. The Baker and.\nSpeaker 1: And Elizabeth. So you five can make your way up to the front, Mr. Pickett. You can begin your remarks.\nSpeaker 14: Hello. I'm Tony Pickard, vice president of master site development for the Urban Land Conservancy. And I'm actually here representing, you will see as the applicant and just here to answer any questions that might come up during the discussion.\nSpeaker 14: Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: No, let me go.\nSpeaker 11: Hi. My name's Nolan Miguel. I'm the director of Global Elyria. Swansea. Right to live. Well, I'm here today in overall support of this project, the global response. The neighborhood leaders have called for additional rooftops in the neighborhoods. For as long as I can remember, the CMC's 358 is in line with our neighborhood plans, although a slight detail\nSpeaker 11: is that there is a little asterisks next to that and that. Asterix When we were in the steering committee for the Illyria Swansea, a plan was saying that community needed to be involved in that process of the rezone.\nSpeaker 11: So I think that's the sort of sticking point is that we, the community would like to be involved and have some set of commitments to to continue to be involved during the whole process of this property. This it's important to point out that globally responsive are our affordable neighborhoods, not affordable housing neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 11: These neighborhoods have been traditionally affordable. So affordable housing doesn't necessarily meet the same qualifications as what we need for our neighbors that are being displaced. They may not qualify for under affordable housing terms. So that's something to really keep in mind.\nSpeaker 11: Also, the I know some other people are going to speak about this as well, but this is going from 150 housing units that are currently in Illyria to potentially 550 units, which is quadrupling, almost quadrupling the amount of housing in this one little neighborhood of Illyria.\nSpeaker 11: So this is a huge, huge impact to this neighborhood. There's also a bunch of infrastructure issues. You know, you guys have heard about the sewer pipeline. Also, there's no sidewalks on 48th or 49th. There's no pedestrian bridge on 47th in York, which is how these children would get to elementary school if they lived here.\nSpeaker 11: There's no the street the 49th street doesn't go all the way through, which is supposed to be in the two C funds funded. So we're looking for a set of commitments. We've talked to Tony about it, hoping to meet more about that.\nSpeaker 11: But that involves community residents being involved in the actual decision making process, including choosing who this developer is. We would like a percentage of the units to be under community control. We'd like every resident of 150 homes in Elyria to be informed about every stage of decision making during this process.\nSpeaker 11: It's only 150 homes. It's not that hard to talk to everyone, and there should be entry points into the process. We overall just displacement is very real right now and globally response. Yeah, it's happening every day and when you hear about a rezoning, sometimes it can escalate those feelings when we don't have guarantees from the city that\nSpeaker 11: that gentrification is going to be addressed. We heard that there's a study, you know, don't know when that's coming, if there's recommendations. I know you guys are asking for that also, but it's really important that we know what where the city stands on gentrification, how this is going.\nSpeaker 11: We need community controlled land that maintains.\nSpeaker 1: McGill.\nSpeaker 11: Affordability.\nSpeaker 1: Ethereum into the thank you. Next we have Kirby Beutel.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I'm Kirby.\nSpeaker 13: Boutwell. I live in Frederick, Colorado, and I work for Eaton Metal Products.\nSpeaker 2: And Eaton is located at 4800.\nSpeaker 13: York Street, which is directly.\nSpeaker 2: East of the 4800 race.\nSpeaker 13: And the company that I work for is zoned industrial. I be, I guess, is.\nSpeaker 2: The the verbiage you guys use.\nSpeaker 13: We've operated out of this property for over 90 years and have not considered relocating or anything. But our products that we build are large industrial.\nSpeaker 2: Products, large tanks, pressure vessels. So we've got a lot of heavy plate steel moving around.\nSpeaker 13: We have tractor trailer rigs with large trailers, construction companies. We also run services. So our initial concern when we heard about this is, of course.\nSpeaker 2: The population.\nSpeaker 13: And the addition for the residents.\nSpeaker 2: In traffic and I guess short and sweet of it. The compatibility and the proximity of this project just does not coincide with what we do as a company. So I'd like you guys to.\nSpeaker 13: Consider opposing the proposal.\nSpeaker 2: That's all.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you. Can you see the bucket?\nSpeaker 7: Hello. My name is Candy Suthep aka I am a resident of Swansea and I'm representing my neighbors who are part of the cross-community coalition, an I.R.A. in the Swansea Elyria area. I support 216. I echo a lot of the sentiments expressed by NOLA.\nSpeaker 7: I think that for our community, displacement right now is a real concern. It's happening because of a lot of the investment and projects that are going on in our neighborhood. And to not take a first step in this process that is simply moving towards fulfillment of our neighborhood plan would be a mistake.\nSpeaker 7: I think that while this development would add 400 units to the neighborhood, a neighborhood of currently 150 units, well, it's good, but we need to focus on maintaining the culture of that community. And we're working with ULC and those set of commitments mentioned earlier to ensure that we maintain a culture and maintain representation in that development of\nSpeaker 7: diverse neighbors. We have high need elderly folks in our neighborhood who don't have a senior living option. This could definitely be an option for them. We have people who, like Noela said our neighborhood has been affordable, so we have people who want to buy and people who want to rent.\nSpeaker 7: And we need to maintain a continuum of options that are affordable for neighbors in the community. But above all, we need to make sure that the neighbors currently in the community are the priority for this development. Right now, with all of the developments, they should be on list.\nSpeaker 7: We should be tracking them. We should be making sure that they get a first crack at the options that are becoming available. This project, in short, is in alignment with the neighborhood plan that was approved in 2015. We'd like the set of commitments that neighborhood neighbors are the first priority.\nSpeaker 7: Community wants to be involved in all decision making, and we want community control over this land trust. So that's all I have to say. And I hope you guys will support this time.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next, we have an Elizabeth. And as Anne is coming forward, I'll call the last two speakers, Drew Dudgeon and Flossie O'Leary. You can come up to the front for you. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 0: Hello. Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this project. My name is Anne Elizabeth. I'm in Globeville and I'm speaking against the passage of this with the hope that it would be passed in 30 or 60 to 90 days.\nSpeaker 0: Instead, as a strong proponent of affordable housing with a very rigorous revisit to the community engagement that has happened. I feel like there's some fiduciary due diligence that needs to happen. When the funding was originally given to this, there was a mention that in the original request that it had a relationship to mitigating the loss of roofs\nSpeaker 0: . And then I think it was at the neighborhood planning meeting, it was mentioned, I think by Urban Land Institute excuse me, Urban Land Conservancy, that that was no longer a part of it. And I want us to understand from the beginning what is the fiduciary structure of this?\nSpeaker 0: And I want us to make sure that the dots or the dots are connected around what the benefits to the community are relative to the overall integration of the neighborhood plans, the National Western Center push, the transit oriented development.\nSpeaker 0: I think that the community engagement process needs to be directly with a town meeting to be called in the next 60 days by the neighborhood and planning meeting in Illyria with a special invitation for the new North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative Administration to come in.\nSpeaker 0: And for the folks that are working on affordable housing, I'll just call it a strategic plan to look at this from the larger picture of neighborhood impact. I do not feel as much as I agree with what Karly CdeBaca just said about the people that should have priorities here, that we can adapt an illusion that the affordable\nSpeaker 0: housing, because of its timeline, is really going to be helpful to the folks that are being displaced by the National Western Center and Court and by economic forces. We need to act much more quickly on that, and I think that we can incorporate that into a town meeting at Swansea Rec Center where we bring in our council\nSpeaker 0: people, we bring in our mayor's office, we bring in folks from the neighborhoods. All you have to do is go door to door. It's very frustrating to me that there are organizations, there are organizations, nonprofits that have received in excess of $1,000,000 in Globeville or Swansea.\nSpeaker 0: The neighborhood planning, community planning and Development has been out there doing neighborhood plans since the end of 2012. We've been working in the National Western Center for a plan for several years, and we still don't get more than 30 or 40 neighbors.\nSpeaker 0: And I think the city needs to step up and do leadership. The I went to the design meetings by there where there were some nice creative conversations, but pictures of a few. People can be deceptive. How are we really creating a neighborhood amenity there?\nSpeaker 0: What does this do to the current homeowners? How does it feel to live next to it? And is it the best use of the plan? This came very late in the Elyria neighborhood planning process to the table. So I would just ask, with that rigorous relook, that we support affordable housing, but let's also evaluate it relative to\nSpeaker 0: the management of affordable housing and how that has to be done at a much higher standard than some of them are happening in Denver for the future. So that's more of a yes and no, but let's do it the right way.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Ms.. Elizabeth. True dudgeon.\nSpeaker 12: Hi. Good evening. My name is Drew Dutcher. I live at 4653 High Street. I've owned a home in Elyria. I live about two blocks from this project. I've lived in an area since 2007, and I've been very active in community engagement and planning and representation at all levels since about 20, 2010.\nSpeaker 12: I'm the president of the Clarion Swanson Neighborhood Association, which formed in January of this year. And I was on the steering committee for the Elyria and Swansea Neighborhood Plan that was passed by City Council in January of 2015.\nSpeaker 12: That was just one of the things I wanted to quote from the neighborhood plan. I think it's page 88 is that this this area of the of Elyria is referred to as a traditional residential area where it says, quote, Residents value the intimate quality of the quiet local streets with modest single family homes, do duplexes and smaller\nSpeaker 12: apartment buildings. I support this project because I think in principle for us, for that transit station to be effective and viable, we need density around that station, the station where, you know, to require investment. I think that's a that's something that is very good and I support in principle that but I, I wanted to talk about the\nSpeaker 12: density of this project. 400 units on six acres is is roughly 67 units per acre. Just by way of comparison, the density of Manhattan, which is the most concentrated urban area in the United States, is 105 units per acre.\nSpeaker 12: But that was built up over 250 years. They have parks, they have subways, they have an infrastructure. It's a modern urban center. And we're I guess some of my concern is that we're going to do this well, not instantly, but over two or three years.\nSpeaker 12: I think we have to do it intelligently and sensitively and with community involvement. And just so regarding the process, I was at two of the three meetings. I don't remember density or building heights, eight stories being discussed. We discussed eight storeys during the neighborhood plan, but I don't remember that really being discussed at the three community meetings\nSpeaker 12: . But I do want to just say that that the the affordable component of this project is absolutely essential. It's my understanding it's 50% affordable that that's that's that's essential to be part of it. And also to underscore NOLA and Candy's point, community involvement going forward is absolutely necessary, including in the choice of the developer.\nSpeaker 12: And this is is essential to guarantee the city's use of it's the city that the city funds are being used for this. So we have to you have an obligation to include the neighborhood in those discussions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dutcher. Flossie O'Leary.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. I'm Flossie O'Leary. I'm a resident of Sunnyside, but I'm here tonight representing a clinic at their back where a federally qualified health center that serves patients throughout the metro Denver area but happened to be located in Globeville and provide behavioral health or mental health services and health education.\nSpeaker 4: Illyria, about two blocks from this facility. I wanted to start with a little bit of a context that I think is helpful. First of all, I attended like and Elizabeth did some of those community meetings last summer where a smaller number of Elyria residents engaged in design and creativity, including children, which was fabulous.\nSpeaker 4: I think that's important. And I want to echo what my colleagues have said, what we need more of that. In fact, a couple of the nonprofits and agencies, including and DCC, have been talking about kind of building on the health impact assessment that was really spearheaded by former Councilwoman Monteiro.\nSpeaker 4: And we're going after funding to do that, to further engage the community members in what their perception of how they could be there and their families be healthy and thrive in the community. But those neighbors that participated last summer were really intuitively right on because what they were sharing in terms of services and opportunities they wanted are\nSpeaker 4: exactly what you see in health research and really what all of us in Denver have been able to see by the great success of the Mariposa Center. And that's when you mix jobs and transportation and training and health services and healthy food and opportunity, integrate with that park and connectivity to transportation.\nSpeaker 4: Then families and individuals see their health and well-being improve. And we'd like to see more of that. And also the challenge of the accelerated level of displacement is something that can't be discounted, but others have spoken to that.\nSpeaker 4: So I would say the rationale for why I'm here supporting to 16 is that although it's not an immediate way of addressing the displacement, it is part of that long term solution. And those affordable units in an affordable community will help families that want to stay in that community, be able to stay and possibly even own.\nSpeaker 4: I think what you heard from the planning of the tiered approach is going to create almost like a buffer to some of the industry in the north and to the east. That really allows more integration. It gets closer to the residents and lower on the south side and creates almost like a safer, quieter campus community that then\nSpeaker 4: integrates with the residences and the park. And then lastly is the more that we can increase those multiple services and opportunities, the more likely we are to help improve the health and wellness of the community. So in closing, I just want to say thank you for the support that you have already provided in helping the ULC secure\nSpeaker 4: this location and to ask for your continued support in terms of the infrastructure, community engagement and just the approval of 216. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Now time for questions from members of council. Councilman Brooks.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. Teresa. And. Teresa, I'm going to ask you to I think I think it's page nine.\nSpeaker 6: Of.\nSpeaker 9: Of your in your slide deck.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Me get there.\nSpeaker 9: I'm just going to ask you to, you know, and the neighborhood plan, it calls for different heights. And we had this discussion within our our planning committee. And let me if you. Yeah. Go to the neighborhood plan where it shows the the different heights.\nSpeaker 9: I think you got to go down a couple more. And so, yeah, there it is. Perfect. So again, we know that plans help guide us, you know, use for guidance towards zoning. And I know my colleague would probably ask the question about this, but I wanted to kind of head this often.\nSpeaker 9: C and allow you to articulate based on this guidance in the plan how you came, how CPD came to work with. You see the applicant on the exact break up from the three to 5 to 8 step down because, you know, obviously in the plan, it looks like the lines are a little different.\nSpeaker 9: But I wanted you to write. Go ahead and talk about that.\nSpeaker 6: Well, so what we did was pay attention to the language of the plan that tells us to step down to the neighborhood and this guidance that tells us we are stepping down from eight stories to three stories. So that other illustration that I was talking about, we started as if we were directly adjacent to a protected district\nSpeaker 6: because that's what we were trying to do with the language of the plan was step down to the residential and protect the residential from the density of that eight stories. So we started with that and stepped up from there.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. And in the plan it uses that the lines are a little greater. It would, it would almost seem like the plan is calling for the middle of the property to be stepped down and. Well.\nSpeaker 6: We didn't it's not a scale drawings. So if there were some measurements in the drawing that tell us the first 50 feet or the first 150 feet have to be three stories or five stories or eight stories. We would have worked with the Urban Land Conservancy to better fit the legal descriptions to that.\nSpeaker 6: But given that it's an illustration and not a scale drawing, we just trying to use our best judgment and the standards that are already in the Denver zoning code.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. I just wanted you to say it for the record. I appreciate it. Tony Pickett, can you. Tony, please describe the process that you went through with the neighborhood to incorporate some of the neighborhoods ideas into the vision of what this could be.\nSpeaker 14: Sure, we actually convened a series of meetings last year, both large scale and some smaller, more intense workshops. We actually had workshops on two different days, different times, morning and evening, as was mentioned earlier. One of those work groups was Kids within the Neighborhood.\nSpeaker 14: We actually had those at facilities within the neighborhood, the Vald\u00e9s Perry Library, as well as the Colorado Miners Recreation Center there in the neighborhood. We actually did things like attended the Swansea Elementary Festival and solicited input from the attendees at that festival as well, and came up with a listing of things that were repeated as themes throughout\nSpeaker 14: the input that we received. Certainly affordable housing was one of those things. Things like commercial kitchens and health clinics and very typical things that you might hear in any neighborhood were things that people desired in terms of the input that we received.\nSpeaker 14: We also participated in some of the Elyria, Swansea and Neighborhood Plan development meetings themselves, and actually this illustration was the subject of an evening, a meeting conversation about the distribution of heights across the site as well as the station area itself, the larger station area.\nSpeaker 14: So you see that same variation in heights extending over toward the station as a result of that meeting. Okay.\nSpeaker 9: You know, you've heard the concern of folks from the neighborhood. And I think, you know, and I've witnessed kind of the Holly area redevelopment that you guys have done, which was a very tense environment, but bringing the community together.\nSpeaker 9: But what really brought that together is that committee, that harp committee that helped guide their process. Are you willing to work in this neighborhood, develop a steering committee to work with the developer on some of the needs that they're looking at?\nSpeaker 14: Yes, we are. In fact, I think most of the speakers that you heard tonight, we had a recent meeting and we agreed to have them designate representatives for that very committee that you're describing in order to work with us throughout the selection and development process.\nSpeaker 9: Great. And then, you know, I follow back up because this had come up but already questions. But I'll follow back up. I want to I want to say because I think Nola mentioned it, the gentrification conversation already will be having in the Business Development Committee Committee 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday.\nSpeaker 9: Next Tuesday. Just to let you all know.\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Thank you. Councilman Brooks, Councilwoman Kenny.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, was going to ask Tony. You were very brief, you know, just offering questions, but you didn't really tell much of the story of the project. So now I'm kind of we certainly want to follow up on the questions we heard from the community.\nSpeaker 11: So can you say a little more about the affordable housing? Someone mentioned a percentage. I didn't know if that was accurate. And if you could just update us a little bit on the affordability mix.\nSpeaker 14: Sure. And just a little bit of the back story you will see was approached by the city's Office of Economic Development, understanding that there was a willing seller of this industrial property, which is within two blocks of the future station at the stock show.\nSpeaker 14: And so it would be an opportunity for equitable transit oriented development. So once the negotiations about the purchase price were completed, it ended up that the city provided you will see a $1.5 million loan that we would at favorable terms that we would have to pay back over time.\nSpeaker 14: But again, in combination with other financing that we were able to secure, we paid that $5.5 million purchase price for the six acre property as part of the city's loan requirements. We're required to provide 51%. You heard 50.\nSpeaker 14: It's 51% of the units, the total units developed on the site as affordable housing at folks at less than 80% of area median income. And also, we were to provide 26 full time jobs as part of the buildout of the development, which will happen in multiple phases over multiple years.\nSpeaker 14: I do want to be very clear. The 400 unit number that has been stated over and over again, it's really up to 400 units. That's our own internal preliminary concepts have determined that we could probably have up to 400 units.\nSpeaker 14: But I can. To tell you that, as was mentioned earlier, the existing infrastructure throughout the neighborhood, beyond the boundaries of the site, the main sanitary sewer line that would connect over to York is inadequate to provide 400 new units on the site.\nSpeaker 14: So we're beginning to have conversations with in DCC, OED and other city departments about the timing and providing some of those infrastructure improvements that we'll need in order to fully realize the potential of the site.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you, Tony. And if I may ask a question of Theresa drew, I appreciate he flagged this for me about six, eight months ago. We him and I talked on the phone about the question of infrastructure. You know, was there going to be a general development plan for this site?\nSpeaker 11: And how is it that infrastructure happens after the zoning? So can you please share with us what kind of infrastructure planning? So we already know about the sanitary sewer, but the residents have good questions about the rest of the infrastructure to support the site, what kind of process will use, and whether that process involves public notice or\nSpeaker 11: meetings or as requirements or encouraged so that we kind of can all live here. Understanding what city processes continue, it's great to know there's a committee that's forming, but we want to understand the city process that will follow this.\nSpeaker 6: Okay, but I am not the infrastructure person, so I have limited knowledge of that. I do know there have been some discussions on roads. Typically when we're talking about roads, we're also talking about what's underneath the roads, which are the drainage systems and all of the other systems.\nSpeaker 6: And that's really the extent of my knowledge on this. I know that we have discussed. The roads. The infrastructure that.\nSpeaker 11: Sorry, I did not prepare you, that I was going to ask that question. So I'm sorry about that. Tony, do you have can you answer with a better. Yeah, sorry about that, Teresa. I didn't warn you. I was coming.\nSpeaker 14: I believe it's just a matter of coordinating the timing of the improvements. In fact, again, the Elyria Swansea plan and the National Western Plan call for things like sidewalks and extending 49th Street through what is currently today the DPS bus, bar and site to actually reach the station from our site.\nSpeaker 14: So there are a number of pedestrian and roadway improvements called for in the plan as well. What I've been hearing in the meetings that I've participated in is it's just just a matter of the timing of implementing those in coordination with everything else that has to happen around the stock show itself as far as its infrastructure improvement\nSpeaker 11: . Can I just clarify, though, Tony, some of these pieces of infrastructure are on your site, so they would go within the purview of your development. It wouldn't be so much a question of when the city is putting sidewalks across the street.\nSpeaker 11: It's it's about what kind of sidewalks you're putting in and what kind of lighting accompanies those sidewalks, whether, you know, there's interior open space or, you know, those kinds of questions are the ones that I'm referring to, things that are and this was Drew's call to me is typically these are things done in a general development plan\nSpeaker 11: . We won't I it's my understanding this site does not meet the criteria.\nSpeaker 6: And again we may need to go those in that case we would be looking at those kinds of things. When we are doing a site development plan, we typically ask developers to put in the sidewalks, to put in as much open space as we can get them to put in and those sorts of things all of course\nSpeaker 6: , according to what the zoning code says we can require.\nSpeaker 11: Great. I just I guess I would ask Tony whether or not you are committed to making sure that whatever committee you establish to talk about the some of the issues the residents raised in, Councilman Brooks asked about, you know, the culture of the community and the uses and those questions, whether that community can also be closely related\nSpeaker 11: involved in the conversation about infrastructure. Sure. You see that that committee has purview over both those areas.\nSpeaker 14: We'd actually welcome that level of input.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. Thank you. And we may just want to follow up a little more with public works. They they gave me a slightly different answer than you guys have about there's something between site planning and general development plans that that and actually it wasn't public works, it was CPD might have been someone else in CPD, but there is\nSpeaker 11: another infrastructure planning process that we've used. So I want to clarify if that's happening or not. We can do that after the meeting. But thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman each. Councilwoman Black.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mr. President. Tony, I have another question for you. So, first of all, I want to thank you, L.Z., for all of the great things you do, just for our purposes and for anyone who may be watching, can you just sort of lay out a general timeline, approximately, of when we might see something there and just\nSpeaker 10: summarize the steps it's going to take to get there just so people are realistic?\nSpeaker 14: Well, let me say, the best thing I can do to illustrate that is to compare it to our development at the 40th in Colorado station on the 9.4 acre site that we purchased there in 2013, we actually had a grand opening for the first 156 units on that site, the first phase the day before the A-line opened\nSpeaker 14: in April. So it took nearly three years just to develop one phase. What we are anticipating here for race, if we can quickly get to some understanding about infrastructure, we would likely solicit for a vertical development partner. Around September, October of this year, have a very definite plan for phase one in place and be able to submit\nSpeaker 14: for low income housing tax credits for a first affordable residential phase next year. If we're lucky enough to be awarded tax credits, which is a rare occurrence, we would be in a position to be able to start that vertical development by the end of next year.\nSpeaker 14: But again, that depends on a lot of variables coming to fruition in a very short period of time, including having the community committee formed and actually participating with us throughout the process.\nSpeaker 10: And you said if all things align, you will start in 2017.\nSpeaker 14: Yes.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. Thank you. And then I don't know if this is just a rhetorical question, but in light of what the man from meat and metal brought up, we have had some discussions about issues with zoning in this part of town and industrial zoning next to residential.\nSpeaker 10: And are we and I don't know for you for you are anticipating any problems around those residential and industrial zone districts abutting one another.\nSpeaker 6: But this might be the best picture you see that outlined in red is the transit oriented development of the site we're talking about. But the blue right next to it is industrial mixed use, which is an attempt in the plan to step back to the industrial, which is the lighter blue in this picture, and still maintain some\nSpeaker 6: of the industrial uses but in between and have a transition area of industrial mixed use before we step up to the transit oriented development. So that's the direction that the plan gives us.\nSpeaker 10: But this blue clad court, is that where Eaton medalists.\nSpeaker 6: My understanding of Eaton medal? Well, it is directly to the east of the property. So my understanding is that the owner of that property was on the steering committee, supported this vision for the plan, and that we this is all secondhand that was told to me.\nSpeaker 6: So my understanding is that for their manufacturing portion of their business, we left them in the industrial portion and then for their storage yard and office, it would be the mixed use area, but actually they still have their industrial zoning and unless they come in and rezone, they'll stay in that industrial zoning.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 6: The first one is for Teresa. So Illyria is one of our historical neighborhoods and I want to know what the requirements are for scale and impact. Directly across the street from residential as it pertains to the historical nature.\nSpeaker 6: Well it's that looked at is part of the rezoning for this project so it's not subject to review by the landmark commission. So I. So that really wasn't factoring in, in looking at the scale project. The plan really talks about it being a traditional residential area, and we should respect that and step down to that.\nSpeaker 6: Okay, Tony, if you could come up for a minute, please. Thank you, Teresa. So you talked about timing and looking at low income tax credits from a. I'm assuming, given the scale of this, that you're looking at some commercial as part of the project?\nSpeaker 14: Possibly, yes.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Have you broached the subject with thorough to look at any tax increment financing for the project?\nSpeaker 14: We haven't had a direct conversation about it, but it certainly has crossed our minds that this might be an avenue to pursue, to accomplish some of the infrastructure improvements that are necessary.\nSpeaker 6: And I know in other there are rare instances that there are examples where a housing development has access to financing, particularly where it's not contributing to the. Volume of tax revenue that the site could generate. So I think that's certainly in line with the discussion that can take place with the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, I appreciate the discussion and the questions that have been asked about process and engagement with the community. As you could see from the presence here tonight, that is a very clear expectation. So I'd like to go on to Drew and ask you if you would come up for just a minute.\nSpeaker 6: To you. You talked about the scale of this project, Drew, in terms of, you know, it's a six acre site. We're talking about 67 units per acre. Where? Give us an idea of where else we have that scale in Denver where we're developing on site.\nSpeaker 2: Wow.\nSpeaker 6: And I know you work in this arena to some degree, but are you familiar with any locations?\nSpeaker 12: I should have something better at my fingertips, but I think I, I off the top of my head, I can't think of 67 units per acre. I was recently the project manager of Phase four of the Mariposa Development for Denver Housing Authority.\nSpeaker 6: Which was near 10th and Osage.\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I worked at 10th and Osage, which was about two and a half acres. And that density I think, was about 25 to 30 units per acre. And there was considerable there was surface parking, there was an interior courtyard, there were this quite a bit of site stormwater management.\nSpeaker 12: So there's all these. So it was a lot and it went from four stories to three stories to two stories. But that is at a TOD that was two blocks from the 10th on Osage State Station Derby. I'm honestly I can't.\nSpeaker 6: Think of 60 question though, about that development sort of as a comparison. I'm familiar with that area. And there's there's one high rise building in that area. I don't remember what the zoning is in that area, but there's a senior high rise building.\nSpeaker 6: Right. And then the rest of that scale is basically four stories I think is right.\nSpeaker 12: There's a mid-rise for senior housing. Right.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I know the scale is a little bit of a concern. I mean, people in the community I'm just making a quick comment here. People in the community know that they need density in the neighborhood. But I think there's a concern being expressed that going to the maximum of what is allowed on the site is is a\nSpeaker 6: little bit much and it's concerning. And so the community process that you're going to be engaged in, I think, is extremely critical to really laying this out in the right way, that it truly is an asset and benefits the neighbors.\nSpeaker 6: So thank you.\nSpeaker 12: Debbie. Thank you. I think that that's that captures very well the concern.\nSpeaker 6: I have no further questions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 12: Just maybe this is something familiar as a reference. So the former baby knows Chili Peppers restaurants up on I-25 there and 23rd Avenue have five buildings there. That development is 45 units per acre, just about six acres. It's a very weird configuration.\nSpeaker 12: It's not a true rectangle in any way, shape or form. The. It's also over parked at 101.69 parking spaces per. So there's a little bit more there. Anyway, I do have questions. Teresa, could you go to slide 15?\nSpeaker 12: I will have questions, but actually I want to talk to Tony first. On Slide 15, you probably need a title. It's review criteria adopted. Consistency with adopted plans. Yep. So, Tony, I don't know if you can see that, but basically south of 48th to 46th between Brighton and York, there is a pretty established neighborhood there.\nSpeaker 12: What is the am I of that neighborhood?\nSpeaker 14: So I'm not aware of that number.\nSpeaker 12: Anyone have that information in the audience? Yeah. Like, what would that census census track MIB? Is it 80? Yeah, I figured I wish somebody had that because I would actually probably posit that 80% am-I is actually gentrification. This area does not.\nSpeaker 12: It has large households that would would reach down to some very low and high levels. 80% am-I are young professionals starting out.\nSpeaker 14: And you know that 80% is not our number. That's the number.\nSpeaker 12: That's old agreement.\nSpeaker 14: Up to 80%. It doesn't mean it will all be a fact. If we use low income housing tax credits, it'll be 60 and below.\nSpeaker 12: So what sort of unit breakdown are you thinking then? Right now.\nSpeaker 14: If you got not that far along in the process, we have yet to even solicit for a vertical development partner. And one other thing I'd like to kind of maybe say at this moment is if we're talking about 400 units in terms of density, again, the 51% affordable overall out of the unit total.\nSpeaker 14: If you keep reducing the overall unit total, you're in essence reducing the number of affordable units.\nSpeaker 12: So if we're trying to capture if we're if we're if there's a genuine concern about gentrification, how important is it to look at the image of the surrounding community and and make sure that the mix of unit and construction and amenity sort of balances out the needs of that community with your development.\nSpeaker 14: It's quite important. And I would say to you, the Urban Land Conservancy, we're actually promoting the idea of a more traditional community land trust to actually go in to control some of the single family homes in that neighborhood, to keep them affordable, to keep people in place so they do not have to move to a new rental\nSpeaker 14: community that we can't build in time to prevent the displacement, as you heard earlier in the comments.\nSpeaker 12: So how come some of those agreements and that those parameters aren't with us today? The reason being is that you said that you convened a series of meetings. Where's that output? How come that's not part of this? Why wasn't that shown to council?\nSpeaker 12: There is a significant public investment in this land and in your programs that you will see. It should be shared along with the specifics about what is desired and how it's incorporated.\nSpeaker 14: I'm not sure what was in the package that you may have seen, but we actually included all of those things in our application for the rezoning. So there was evidence required of us of those meetings and what the outcomes were.\nSpeaker 12: And what were those titled?\nSpeaker 14: I wouldn't be able to tell you that.\nSpeaker 12: So are there any firm commitments because you've spoken to them? Are there any why why were members of the community asking for your commitment to this community involvement? Were there any firm written agreements made so that it was it's that the community has confidence and assurance that they will be.\nSpeaker 14: I'll say this councilmember maybe you might want to ask about this. We actually proposed at one point a memorandum of understanding or something similar to actually document everyone's expectations. And I have not been able to accomplish that today.\nSpeaker 12: And what do you think's the sticking point there?\nSpeaker 14: I have no idea.\nSpeaker 12: No. And will the community have a role in the selection of the developer? Yes. Okay. And then lastly. Maybe it's people doing what they're not supposed to do. I don't know. But I have seen, in fact, a development proposal for this property concept.\nSpeaker 12: It was not obviously it predates this rezoning by some substantial amount. What is that?\nSpeaker 14: We actually generated multiple concepts as part of the process that I mentioned earlier last year. So you may have seen one of those. But I would say we were very clear that all of them were potential options and subject to us actually selecting a final developer and vetting those in terms of market feasibility.\nSpeaker 12: The reason why I'm concerned is that those proposals, the concepts that were presented all pretty much pretty close to what I think is is actually a sensible way of approaching this land. My concern is as I come from northwest Denver and when you show me a box like that that Teresa is that defined the heights, we tend\nSpeaker 12: to get buildings like that and this is obviously a different area. And those schemes spoke to the sort of difference. But 400 units really speak to more of that density that was shown. So how do I comport? What is what is that you guys have yourself admitted that you at least tested versus what I have seen conceptually\nSpeaker 12: versus the the fabric.\nSpeaker 14: The the diagram that you saw was generated by the planning department just to show exactly as you characterized it, the bulk that this zoning would accomplish on the site. But all of our building envelopes, which are smaller than that, both diagram fit within there.\nSpeaker 14: And it gives us enough flexibility so that if we have to change some of those as we go through this partner selection, we're able to do that.\nSpeaker 12: So what sort of commitment are you guys willing to make on those bulks that have been laid out before because they are substantially different?\nSpeaker 14: I would say to you that there has never been any intent to build out that diagram from our part. Our part.\nSpeaker 12: Great. But please don't let me see here about permits coming for that, because there's something intrinsically different between that in this. So then now back to to Teresa. I wasn't going to talk about this, but my my colleague here brought it up.\nSpeaker 12: And the reason why I was going to talk about it is I do understand that we have the latitude as members of council to sort of, you know, pass zoning Arizonians that we see meet the meet our criteria.\nSpeaker 12: And part of that, when we when we're granting essentially latitude relative to small area plans for affordable housing, that seems like a worthwhile endeavor to me, a good reason to grant additional development potential. That said, there there is you said you used your best judgment when you've read the text of the code.\nSpeaker 12: So going back to the slide that has well, let's stick on this slide. Right. So you already moved there. I want to go back to the slide. We were just at that. We're probably going to go back in number 15.\nSpeaker 6: Which you're talking about. Okay.\nSpeaker 12: Because this if you look at that, those lines, what you have is you have an area of five story development that is clearly greater than 50% of the block. And we now go back to the slide. You were at 18.\nSpeaker 12: When you look at that eight story section, it is far less than 50% of the block. And if we're going to say that, we're going to rely on that on the text, why not just call that all residential between 3 to 8 stories and give it one color, rather than define these steps with the public and then\nSpeaker 12: get voted on and passed by council? If the language is of that 3 to 5 area, that it should step down closer to a particular street. Because that would then solve my dilemma here, which is that it clearly shows where those steps should occur and what you're clearly using your best judgment is sort of ignoring what was\nSpeaker 12: already agreed to by community and past council.\nSpeaker 6: I think that it's a long standing tradition to look at illustrations in plans as simply that. An illustration, not a. Definition of proportion unless there's a proportion defined in the drawing.\nSpeaker 12: So help me out here. This is a illustration on Slide 18, but if I roll back to say Slide 15, that seems to indicate why not just show those lines sort of anywhere? Again, I mean, we try when we're illustrating things to convey what we're showing.\nSpeaker 6: But this.\nSpeaker 12: I mean, it's it can't be a cartoon in one sense. And then it lost representation another.\nSpeaker 6: You're showing the whole neighborhood and we're talking about one property in that neighborhood. So when we're illustrating the plan, that little property is, you know, like a fingernail size on the map that we're creating. And so it's very hard to get an accurate picture of what we're talking about.\nSpeaker 12: I just and.\nSpeaker 6: That's a blow up of a plan on whatever page in the planning document, I took that little piece of property and blew it up so you could see it better. But that's not how it presents itself in the plan that you adopted.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, it does, but it's all cropped to show just that piece of property. So it's it's very you know, we're talking about sort of graphic scales.\nSpeaker 12: Okay. Then go to page 14.\nSpeaker 6: Page four, slide 14.\nSpeaker 12: By 14.\nSpeaker 6: Okay.\nSpeaker 12: At the corner of Claude and 47th. Okay. It appears to me that there are two individual parcels in these C of single family duplex. Mm hmm. That are.\nSpeaker 6: That are weapons of change.\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I mean, that's pretty specific mixed use.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. According to this map.\nSpeaker 12: And represented at this same. Nearly the same scale.\nSpeaker 6: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 12: I mean, it seems like we pass this language to suit our whatever.\nSpeaker 6: Actually, that map that we were talking about was developed after the plan was adopted. Again, using our judgment on what the language said and what we thought that illustration was depicting, that this would be a step down from eight to 5 to 3, the primary motivation being to step down to the existing residential and protect that.\nSpeaker 6: That's why we use that protected zone zone district standard to to work with urban land and come up with the boundary of those areas.\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. So just for future reference, see that is in fact putting there drainage for I-70 if it goes through, which is another sort of not merely great idea on clod. On on clod, which is one block went one block through there.\nSpeaker 12: So they'll be digging up and they're going all the way to the full depth of the lowest point of that thing right there. So, you know, let's don't put the infrastructure on top unless we know that they're going to replace that.\nSpeaker 12: But we can coordinate with them if that happens. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Any other questions? 216. Seen on public hearings, not closed time for comments. Councilman Brooks.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. First, I just want to thank Councilman Monteiro, who, you know, early on had this vision to work on this with Paul, Washington, with Aaron, Paul with Tony Pickett. And I remember when the idea was first floated, I didn't think that we could get it done that soon.\nSpeaker 9: And we did. And so kudos on the purchase of this property and moving forward on the merits of the zoning. I am supportive of this. This, you know, we just passed our guess neighborhoods plans and it's so exciting to see implementation happen just over a year.\nSpeaker 9: And so this this zoning meets the plan and in the context and it is I think it's it fits right in plans to counter my colleague over here plans are meant to guide they are not meant to be over prescriptive.\nSpeaker 9: And so we've had this conversation before in Cherry Creek. What they're doing is having gradient lines to provide that flexibility. And if that helps, maybe we should look at that. But to me, plan's guide we cannot over be over prescriptive in it to the actual implementation and development of of all of this.\nSpeaker 9: I want to just say a couple of things. One. Councilman Ortega, you're exactly right. Tax increment financing can finance affordable housing. It's being done right now at 2300. Whelton is being done right now. 2460. Welton is being done right now.\nSpeaker 9: 2560 Welton and 23 Welton is all housing 30 to 60% AMI affordable housing. So that's a great idea for this would love to work with the community, work with the team to talk about Tracy Huggins, seeing if this is an area of opportunity to the community.\nSpeaker 9: Hear you loud and clear on the infrastructure, the sidewalks, the 40, 47th and York overpass. These are things that in DCC public works. OED we all need to come together and find this. It's going to be interesting on the timing.\nSpeaker 9: Is it does the money come first? Then we find the developers and developers come at the same time. Let's let's all work together on that. What you did at Harp was probably once one of the most amazing transformative projects with a really hard neighborhood that's been ripped by gang violence.\nSpeaker 9: And to see what's been done, I'm a big believer. How can that happen here? How can we bring this community is stirring community to empower them to see the vision that they desire to see. So I hope that this can happen.\nSpeaker 9: Our office wants to be a part of it and our office wants to help push in DCC OED on all of the infrastructure needs to make this a reality. This is a neighborhood that is, you know, going through a lot of change and we need to do whatever we can to make sure that we see sustainability within\nSpeaker 9: this neighborhood. And so I'm supportive of that and I want to make sure that it comes to fruition and and make sure that the neighbors feel empowered to lead that effort as well. So I'm supportive of this. I'm excited to see it come to fruition.\nSpeaker 9: And I will I hope my colleagues will be supportive of this as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman Lopez to Councilman Brooks, Councilman Lopez, rep.\nSpeaker 9: Legendary district three.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. President. I will be very brief. I think, you know, I was able to see this plan from its beginnings to see it develop and see the different stakeholders at the table. And, you know, I just I just wish that there were some other folks who are around anymore to see this happen and to see\nSpeaker 2: this implemented. I think, you know, a few come to mind. But here's here's here's the thing. The fact that this plan is actually being implemented and not be not just sitting on a shelf in CPD is a good thing, right?\nSpeaker 2: In the fact that we actually have some table I, I trust you, the ULC and what they're doing. I think we've worked together in the past on Morrisson Road, which is you. I have some very similar challenges in terms of connectivity, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of bringing life back into into the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 2: Here's the thing. Density helps achieve that. And you know, what we have to consider at this hearing is an issue of zoning. Right. And if it's the right zoning, you can't consider deals and considered deals. You can't consider anything else.\nSpeaker 2: Although those are different fruits that I think this will help produce. And those are different trails that we can all go down and explore. And I think the city and looking at, you know, bringing some of these neighborhoods back on the grid and, you know, focusing in some of these neighborhoods that need that attention with the fact\nSpeaker 2: that you went on record and talked about the sidewalks and the infrastructure and the needs that go along with it, because the density will bring more foot traffic, more traffic all together. And the desperate need for that, infrastructure upgrades and the you know, what happens to the West doesn't necessarily we shouldn't rely on that one thing.\nSpeaker 2: We should rely on our regular general fund money to be able to do stuff like that. Here's what I will say and I think suggest move forward. I mean, I do support this moving forward because I think it does need that.\nSpeaker 2: It does that we need that density. I think this is. Zone districts are very appropriate for for the area. They're not a huge increase. I think they're gradual increase and it does get implemented over time. The one thing I would really push for any kind of development happening in the center, when we think of affordability, we think\nSpeaker 2: a density it's not just the number of one bedroom units is the number of two and three bedroom units that can be achieved. Those are the families that when you talk about displacement, those are the apartments, those are the units, those are the houses that we are dying to build.\nSpeaker 2: And dying to fill in folks who who want to be able to call Swansea and still call Swansea home. Right. Those are the units that we expect to see and I think that's helped. How will you help achieve that balance?\nSpeaker 2: Right. So I'd like in the stages of this plan being implemented. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to express my support for this project moving forward. You know, we're seeing a lot of families in these three neighborhoods already being displaced. We're seeing landlords raising their rents. And families are struggling, trying to figure out where they're going to go next.\nSpeaker 6: It's too bad we couldn't have done this project like two or three years ago so that the units would be up and ready and people would have a place to go. And so that's that's a challenge in terms of timing.\nSpeaker 6: But I just I hope that Councilwoman Montero routinely watches these meetings and that she's seen some of the fruits of her labor and know your efforts in having been involved with this as a staff member to Councilwoman Montero and in the continuity of your continued work in and with the neighborhoods to just ensure that all these pieces\nSpeaker 6: come together to Urban Land Conservancy. Thank you for your work. I know you guys have played a major role in a number of projects at TOD Sites in making sure that affordability continues to be a big part of many of these projects that, you know, if it if it weren't for that, you know, we would probably be\nSpeaker 6: seeing market rate developments at most of these sites and not the affordability mix that, you know, comes with the commitment of ULC seeking the low income tax credit resources that help ensure that people who most rely upon public transportation can actually live next to these stops and that they're not all occupied by people who pay higher rents\nSpeaker 6: . So I think that's really important. I think Councilman Brooks covered most of my other comments, but I think this will be good for the neighborhood. The continued involvement with the neighborhood is a vital piece of just making sure that it comes together in the right way with that ongoing community support as part of what will make it\nSpeaker 6: work in that interface with the residents that are still in the neighborhood. So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman, can each.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you, Mr. President. And I just briefly wanted to say thank you to you c michael Sapp often uses this term Standing in the gap. And in this case, you stepped into a gap. We as a city don't typically own property, maintain it and plan for its future directly.\nSpeaker 11: We respond, but we're not a great person or entity to lead that. So thank you for stepping up and stepping into that gap. For that, I want to say thank you to the community residents for your willingness to help envision into the future enough to say you support this zoning moving forward.\nSpeaker 11: Tonight, I heard that that hope and that belief and I think that's wonderful to hear. And I think, you know, we are dealing with an envelope tonight. I think the case is very strongly made for the envelope based on the neighborhood plan that just it's a very close match.\nSpeaker 11: But we all understand clearly that there's more to fill in inside that envelope. And I hear that from all parties. So thank you for the diligence. I know having looked at some of the things in the communities email, it seems like some of those things might be in conflict with the rules for affordable housing as they come\nSpeaker 11: down from the federal government and how it's financed. But many of the things in there seem achievable. So I hope you don't let agreement on some things stop you from doing an MRU just because you can't get everything in the same document.\nSpeaker 11: So I encourage you to get those things you agree with documented and signed, even if you either can't, you know, come to agreement on all the other pieces or you're still working on them. But it seems to me like you've got a lot of a lot of ground here that could easily be documented.\nSpeaker 11: And then you can either understand more about the pieces you can't do because it doesn't always work with tax credits or the pieces that you just need more time to do. So that's my my hope is that you can get nailed down the things that you agreed to now.\nSpeaker 11: So good luck to you all. Let us know how we can continue to support you. You're very good at doing that as community and the developers. They know where to find us as well. But but we have a lot of work left ahead of us.\nSpeaker 11: And please know that this will stay on our radar even after we approve the zoning. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman, can each. Councilman Brooks.\nSpeaker 9: You know, I couldn't help but bringing this up because we just had the marijuana conversation. This is zoned iby today. So this is a for use by right for any marijuana business that wanted to come in here. And so I think it's important that when we talk about visioning the future, folks who are maybe against this project\nSpeaker 9: need to think about the consequences of the neighborhood across the street as single family residential. And so I just wanted to bring that up because we love that topic of marijuana so much on this dais. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Brooks.

        "source": "Speaker 0: All right. We're going to go ahead and get started this evening. We're coming back from recess here. And this evening we have one public hearing tonight for those participating in person when called upon. We ask that you please come to the podium and on the presentation monitor on the wall you will see your time counting down for\nSpeaker 0: those participating virtually when called upon. Please wait until our meeting hosts promote you to speaker. When you are promoted, your screen will flash and say Reconnecting to meeting. Please do not leave the meeting. You will be reconnected and will need to turn on your camera if you have one.\nSpeaker 0: And your microphone, you'll see your time counting down at the bottom of your screen. Once you've finished speaking, you will change back to participant mode and see your screen flash one more time. All speakers should begin their remarks by telling the council their names and cities of residence and if they feel comfortable doing so.\nSpeaker 0: Their Home Address. If you've signed up to answer questions only, please state your name and note that you are available for questions of counsel. Speakers will have 3 minutes. There is no yielding of time. If translation is needed, you will be given an additional 3 minutes for your comments to be interpreted.\nSpeaker 0: Will alternate between in-person and virtual for efficiency by calling in-person participants and then alternating to virtual participants. Speakers must stay on the topic of the hearing and must direct their comments to the council members. Please refrain from profane or obscene speech.\nSpeaker 0: Direct your comments to council as a whole and please refrain from individual or personal attacks. Councilmember Sandoval, will you please put Council Bill one, three, two, two on the floor for final passage?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. I move that bill. One, three, two. To be placed on. Very final passage.\nSpeaker 0: Sorry. All right, we've got it on final consideration for passage. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for council bill one, three, two, two is open. And we're going to have the staff report here from Councilmembers Flynn and Ortega.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Madam President. Councilwoman Ortega and I are very pleased to bring this forward for the last couple of years. Some of us have been discussing how best to recognize the contributions of Kathy Reynolds, Councilwoman Kathy Reynolds to this body, to this city, and to all of its people.\nSpeaker 6: And I think they are only regret is that she is not here with us any longer to see this happen. But I don't know if Councilwoman, if you want to make a few opening remarks.\nSpeaker 0: I just want to thank Councilman Flynn for working together in bringing this forward and reaching out to former colleagues, many of which are either here or online. That will be speaking to you shortly. But when we explored what made sense, naming the chambers was like the perfect solution to honor Cathy Reynolds.\nSpeaker 0: And it will be something that will, you know, last forever. I mean, this this building was built to last forever. And Cathy's contributions were just enormous. And we'll we'll walk through those shortly.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Before we get started, I do want to recognize one person here in the chamber that we haven't seen in a very long time. There are as many former members of this body who are here. But there's one gentleman here who served on the third floor for many years, and that is our former city attorney, Dan\nSpeaker 6: Muse, who is here with his wife, a SEAL Harmer. Dan, thank you for your service to the city. Dan was city attorney for many years under Mayor Wellington Webb and I spoke with him right before this. He said Cathy is just one of a kind and he's he's very pleased that council's taking this step.\nSpeaker 6: Let me tell you exactly why we have filed this bill and believe that this is something that ought to be approved unanimously. Up until 1975. No woman had ever been elected to this body. In the year 1975, two women were.\nSpeaker 6: Kathy Reynolds holds the distinction of having been elected first because the second woman elected that year. Kathy Donahue had a runoff. And so Kathy Reynolds was elected in May and Kathy Donahue was elected in a runoff in June in District ten, which I don't think was perfect at that time.\nSpeaker 6: Councilman Hines But but she helped to make it so and so. Two women took office that year sitting among 11 men. She was reelected a total of seven times. There are three other members of this body. Who have been elected seven times.\nSpeaker 6: One was the longtime councilman from what was then District eight and five points, and that's Elvin Caldwell. Councilman Caldwell, though, did not serve the entire 28 years. So Councilwoman Reynolds has the record of tenure. That is the longest.\nSpeaker 6: Councilman Caldwell was appointed during his seventh term as manager of safety by Mayor McNichols, so he resigned his seat during that seventh term. The other council member who served seven consecutive continuous terms is the gentleman memorialized on the plaque by the door into our office.\nSpeaker 6: And that's Paul Hensel, who served seven terms out of District four in southeast Denver. The other member of this council, who will have served seven complete terms, is standing to my left, and that is our councilwoman, Debbie Ortega.\nSpeaker 6: Councilwoman Ortega, Ortega's tenure is discontinuous. She served four terms until term limits took effect in 2003. And then, as we all know, she was reelected to this body in 2011 and is serving right now her seventh term and will be termed out at the end of this particular service.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, I think it is remarkable and very honorable of Councilwoman Ortega that while she will match Councilwoman Reynolds in years of service, she is a co-sponsor to this and is is fully supportive. I don't know, Councilwoman, if you want to make some remarks on that.\nSpeaker 0: So I just want to say I had the pleasure of serving with Councilwoman Reynolds. Alongside many of her colleagues who are here tonight. And she was an incredible individual who was a mentor to all of us, newbies who came on.\nSpeaker 0: When I got elected, there were four new council members and it was enough to sort of shake things up a little bit in terms of looking at doing things a little bit differently. But she truly was an individual who brought a lot of knowledge and was always willing to sit down and answer questions and just offer her\nSpeaker 0: wisdom. When I was struggling with with varying issues, we worked very closely together on a build out of the Central Valley. The Pepsi Center was in my district. She and I served on the committee together. And, you know, we'll talk more about her contributions.\nSpeaker 0: But it it is just an honor to be able to do this tonight and to recognize Cathy in this way for her many, many contributions to this city that will be in place for many, many years into the future.\nSpeaker 6: She, Kathy Reynolds will have the longest continuous service of any council member by a quirk of a charter. And as former city attorney muse may remember this, but after the 91 mayoral election and the very hectic runoff that year, that led to Mayor Webb taking office almost immediately after the runoff and not having the time that should\nSpeaker 6: be afforded to put together an administration. There was a charter amendment put on the ballot to push the inauguration back to the third Tuesday in I'm sorry, the third Monday in July. It used to be the first Monday in July.\nSpeaker 6: So Councilwoman Reynolds will have that record over Councilwoman Hensel on the wall over there, excuse me, by two weeks. During her tenure, Councilwoman Reynolds served alongside.\nSpeaker 9: 38.\nSpeaker 6: Different members of the council four times. She was elected council president. She actually served five terms because when Councilman Caldwell was resigned to become manager of safety. Councilwoman Reynolds had been pro tem and she became acting well. She became the president for the rest of Councilman Caldwell's year as president.\nSpeaker 6: Eight times she was elected as council president pro tem. Since the election of 1975, when council members Reynolds and Donohue became the first two women that seemed to open the floodgates for women in office. Here's one of the flood gates right here.\nSpeaker 6: And we have in seated in the audience, we have a number of women who were elected to this body subsequent to that. And I don't know if this was the appropriate time. Could all members. It is because I just said it could.\nSpeaker 6: All members who have all persons who have served on this body, please stand up and be recognized. Thank you. It should be noted, though, that Kathy Reynolds was not the first woman to serve on the body. I purposely put in the presentation first woman elected because of one of those vagaries of history.\nSpeaker 6: In 1935, as you can see in this newspaper article, who was there was Eugene Bartholdi from North Denver, who resigned.\nSpeaker 1: About.\nSpeaker 6: Four months before the end of his term in 1935. And Mayor George but goal appointed a woman, Elissa Paladino from North Denver to fill out the last four months of that term. And she did not run again. And I wanted to draw your attention to her quote at the bottom of that story.\nSpeaker 6: It says, You can bet Mrs. Paladino said, you can bet I won't neglect my cooking and sewing. I cannot imagine don't stab me in the back here. I cannot imagine those words being said to a newspaper reporter by Sal Carpio or Ted Hackworth or Paul Schwalm or Tim Sandoz.\nSpeaker 6: Right. Or who else is your Charlie Brown? Charlie Brown here now. So since that election go from 1979 onward, 31 of the 56 people who've been elected to this body since 1979 were women. A majority, 31 out of the 56 people elected to this body were women.\nSpeaker 0: This is crazy. I also want to acknowledge the men who are not here, who are no longer here, who Cathy served with. And that was Councilman Bill Roberts, Sal Carpio, Hiawatha Davis. Bill Zeigler. Elvin Caldwell. Sam Sanders. Ted Hackworth.\nSpeaker 0: Bob Kreider. Paul Hensel. Ed Burke. Joe Nolan. Larry Perry and Ken Macintosh. These are all you know, this was when it was predominantly a male body. But these are men who are no longer alive. And I wanted to acknowledge them.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. So I want to go on to some of the policy initiatives that we believe merit naming this room where these events took place, where these initiatives were passed and the debates took place in recognition of the person who advanced them or primarily advanced them, because I think Councilwoman Reynolds would not ever say that she did\nSpeaker 6: this alone. She was collaborative. She worked with anybody and everybody who could get the ball across the goal line. Right. So one of the one of the nation's first gay rights laws passed in Denver in 1990 with significant debate and controversy, such controversy that led in part because other cities around the state also passed similar laws around\nSpeaker 6: the same time. But it resulted in an event many of us remember it came out of Colorado Springs was Amendment two in 1992, and that was a constitutional amendment that passed by the people of this state that said no city can adopt any gay essentially any gay rights laws.\nSpeaker 6: This was challenged up to the state Supreme Court and eventually went to the United States Supreme Court in 1996 and resulted in the landmark ruling that extended equal protection based on sexual orientation. You will hear tonight. You will hear tonight from two individuals who were central to that debate.\nSpeaker 6: They. One of them flew in from Portland, Oregon, to be here tonight to talk to you about those times and some of the hate and division that. Roll out of that debate. Councilwoman Reynolds also was a leader in changing the city's most restrictive zone district regulation r zero zoning under the old 1956 code.\nSpeaker 6: R zero zoning was the most exclusive in the city. And one of the regulations was that. No unrelated adults could live together. Unmarried couples could not live together. Effectively, this was a barrier, a bar prohibition. Two gay couples living in some of our finest neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 6: You know, it only applied in the zero zone, but we're saying, well, you all can live somewhere else, but you can't live here. And she was instrumental in leading the charge to have that repealed. She also led a successful drive for the budget amendment that we know today as the the mill levy for people with intellectual developmental\nSpeaker 6: disabilities. That was hotly contested both here on the floor and on the third floor. This was during the Pena administration, I believe, excuse me. And there was actually kind of a raucous debate. I won't name the names. And I think who told me about this?\nSpeaker 6: I think it was former councilman Ed Thomas told me about this. And Councilman Ortega, I think you were council president that year that this was being debated. Councilwoman Reynolds got into a heated argument on this floor with a male member of the body who shall remain nameless.\nSpeaker 6: And it got so intense that I was told the Council on President Ortega said from that desk, Madam President, would you to take it out in the hall? Whereupon Councilman Thomas shouted from his desk. My money's on Reynolds.\nSpeaker 6: And. And he won because that mill levee did pass. And it has been extended by the voters of Denver once Tabor came into effect. The voters of Denver approved increasing that mill levy sometime in the early to late nineties.\nSpeaker 6: I don't have the exact year.\nSpeaker 0: Let me just add, when when that passed, it was only generating like around $1,000,000. That fund now generates upwards of it's a full mill. I don't remember what that is now, but when I came on in 2011, it was at about 13 million, and now we think it's closer to 20 million.\nSpeaker 0: So it's making huge impact on people with developmental disabilities. And Cathy should be so proud of that work that she did.\nSpeaker 6: And finally, the other initiative that we want to bring to your attention is one that I recall vividly when I was when I was a reporter, the Rocky Mountain News. I remember the intense level of threats that threats that came in to this office over here against the councilwoman because she was the prime sponsor of the first\nSpeaker 6: assault weapons ban in Denver, the one that eventually survived court challenges and challenges from the state legislature to preempt our home rule ability to take such action in the here in the city. I remember many times after Monday night that she had to have a police escort to her home in Park Hill because of the threats that\nSpeaker 6: were coming in.\nSpeaker 0: And we have had the pleasure of the sheriff's department being at our Monday night meetings on a regular basis. And I can remember having to be escorted out to our cars after that legislation passed, because the threat wasn't just directed at Kathy, it was at the whole body because we passed it.\nSpeaker 6: Some things don't change, do they? Project initiatives. I intentionally led this presentation, Madam President, with policy initiatives. But I also want to talk about project initiatives because Councilwoman Reynolds, along with many of the folks you see here behind us.\nSpeaker 6: Played central roles in the development of so many things that the people of Denver right now take for granted the Colorado Convention Center, the new Colorado Convention Center. Where should it go? Remember, comes from there were three different sites that were Central Platte Valley, the Golden Triangle, or right downtown.\nSpeaker 6: Imagine what this city would look like if instead of a transit hub behind Union Station, there was a convention center. I think that was the Marvin Davis site. And then the site behind where the library is now. There wouldn't have been a library expansion if we had made that mistake.\nSpeaker 6: The Convention Center Hotel, which is now the Hyatt Regency Denver International Airport, of course, Coors Field, the new Broncos stadium, the Pepsi Center, which is now changed its name, I think, to Ball Arena. I used this picture. Thank you to Leah and Carla SHAPIRO from The Denver Post, the editor who allowed us to use these photos.\nSpeaker 6: This is. This is a photograph that really says something about Kathy Reynolds being working with a group of men right over there in that corner that if you recognize that's that window over there, she is the person with her.\nSpeaker 6: Back to you and her purse on the floor. I'm going to steal one of Rick's stories. Rick told me that one day a constituent got in Cathy's face and said, You know what your problem is, Reynolds? You never saw a project that you didn't like.\nSpeaker 6: And if there's anything you can say about Kathy Reynolds, one of the first things will be she was very quick witted. She would think of the rest of the responses. Take me three days to come up with. Right?\nSpeaker 6: She got right back in the guy's face and said, no, you never saw a project that I didn't like. She was also a leader in representing Denver outside of this room. She served all 28 years on this body as the rep, as one of the representatives to the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District Board.\nSpeaker 6: What we now call the Mile High Flood District, including the last 23 years as the board chair. And you will hear during the public hearing from the former head of the of what they called advocate, I remember a councilwoman around was giving reports the committee saying she had gone to an urban drainage luncheon that month and giving\nSpeaker 6: a report on. I thought nothing is less appetizing than an urban drainage luncheon. I have no idea what they served there, but doesn't sound appetizing. She was twice elected as president of the Colorado Municipal League, and in your email you have a statement of support from the former president of the Colorado Municipal League, Sam Mamet, who is\nSpeaker 6: on travel and could not be here tonight and deeply regrets that he could not be here. But he sent a statement that is in your email. She was elected president of the National League of Cities in 1987, serving as basically the chief spokesperson for municipal issues in the country, testifying in Congress several times during that year as\nSpeaker 6: president. And after leaving council, she was a charter member of the Citizen Oversight Board and served on the Colorado Convention Center Hotel Board.\nSpeaker 0: I want to just. Yes. So when she was the president of the National League of Cities, she encouraged all of us to get involved with the National League of Cities. We attended many of their annual conferences. It gave us an opportunity to learn about best practices being done in other cities, to come back with new and different\nSpeaker 0: ideas. And I just appreciated that about her because it just continued to help with the growth and the knowledge and the ability to just look at things differently.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I love this picture. It shows a bit of determination and kind of the pursed lips. Right. And she must be really mad at something. I don't know what it was. Maybe it's one of my stories in The Rocky.\nSpeaker 6: I don't know, but. When we were looking a couple of years ago for where could we find a place to recognize Cathy's contributions? We looked around, but she served at large, and so she didn't have a district where there was a park that she championed or a rec center like the Kala Madison Rec Center or the Shimer\nSpeaker 6: Rec Center or the Hiawatha Davis Recreation Center. She was citywide and we were kind of brainstorming. There's no park, there's no rec center. And it was one of our former legislative analysts. You might remember Shelley Smith. Who just popped up and said, Why not the chamber?\nSpeaker 6: Because of the variety, the breadth, the depth of her accomplishments. What better place than the room in which they occurred? The room where it happened, if you will. And so that's why we bring this this bill forward. Let me before you start the public hearing, Madam President, one former member who cannot be here or is not here\nSpeaker 6: is watching online. That is Councilwoman Rosemary Rodriguez from Council District three and who served in several other roles in city government. She sent me a message that she I don't know if she wanted me to read it. Maybe she'll kill me when she when I see her next.\nSpeaker 6: But here's what she said. Here's my synopsis of Kathy Reynolds. There is a song from the show Gypsy, that is sung by Mama Rose. The relevant lyric is this. You either got it or you don't. And guys, I got it.\nSpeaker 6: That describes Cathy's relationship with Denver. She knew the code. She knew the players. She knew the people. What a wonderful idea to name the meeting room for the woman who convened countless meetings for Denver's diverse, disparate and disagreeable.\nSpeaker 6: She knew our people and loved us all.\nSpeaker 1: Full stop.\nSpeaker 6: I also want to mention I don't I didn't see I don't know if we have online. Former Councilwoman Elena Wedgeworth. She online is she signed up to speak as well? Excellent. Okay. Thank you. And so, Madam President, with one more moment of indulgence, I want to mention one other person who is here who flew in from Washington\nSpeaker 6: , DC. Where? Oh, Judy. Judy Gold was Kathy Reynolds council aide and started at a time when it was very unusual for us to have assistants working with us. Right. So, Judy, I want to thank you for coming in, flying in from D.C. to be here for this special moment.\nSpeaker 6: And with that, Madam President, I'm told Mayor Webb is also on line. To speak since Mayor Webb is on line. I wanted to show everybody that among her effects, 1996, 1997, the mayor's box at Mile High Stadium. The tickets were always divvied up between the mayor's office and the city council.\nSpeaker 6: And there was quite a blowup. Maybe Mayor Webb. He might not address this. So let me do it.\nSpeaker 1: These are the last four.\nSpeaker 6: Season ticket packages from the 1997 season for the mayor's box and nine in 1997 that never got distributed. And there are still ink in Cathy's files. And so it's a little bit of history. I don't know if it's too late to get them to the mayor now, but I'll give them back to Rick.\nSpeaker 6: With that, Madam President, I don't know if, Councilwoman, you have any more remarks before we open the hearing.\nSpeaker 0: The only thing I would add is that when. Judy Gold was a council aide to Councilwoman Reynolds. Ramona martinez was one of the other aides. I think they were the first two that were hired on to work for members of city council.\nSpeaker 0: And then Ramona went on to replace Sam Sanders as a member of council. But they paved the way for council as well. And back then, there was only one aide for council member. It grew. It has grown over time.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you all for allowing us to do this presentation. We're truly honored to bring this forward and look forward to hearing from her former colleagues as well. Very good. Well, thank you. Councilmembers Ortega and Flynn for the presentation.\nSpeaker 0: We always appreciate learning a bit more about the history and the remarkable accomplishments of Kathy Reynolds. This evening, we have 14 individuals signed up to speak and we're going to call the first two who are joining us online.\nSpeaker 0: And then the rest of the speakers are here in chambers with us. And so our first speaker this evening is Wellington Webb. And we need to see if you are on line. We have one call in number and we believe that that is.\nSpeaker 0: Former Mayor Webb. But we're not. Seen it now. Okay. All right. We're going to go ahead and we will try to get him back into the queue. But we're going to go ahead and go with Elba. Wedgeworth is our next speaker.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We can. We want you to go ahead and we can hear you now. Go ahead, please. We're not able to hear you. You might have to unmute. I think we're having some problems with the mike. And so we might need to have you leave the Zoom meeting and log back in.\nSpeaker 0: And when you log back in, make sure to connect your audio up. We're showing that your audio's not connected. And so we'll go ahead and try to get those two online speakers back into the queue. And so in the interest of time, we'll go ahead and transition into chambers.\nSpeaker 0: And the first speaker in chambers is Tim Santos.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening, Madam President. Members of Council. My name is Tim Sandoz and I currently reside in Green Valley Ranch and am proud to be able to be here tonight to speak to you about my dear friend and mentor Cathy Reynolds.\nSpeaker 9: Now, Cathy Reynolds and my father, Sam Santos, were elected at the same time, in the same term, and they came in to serve together. At that time, my student council advisor was Mr. Rick Reynolds, who just happened to be Cathy's husband.\nSpeaker 9: He is the one who taught me Robert's Rules of Order. He taught me Robert's Rules of Order. Kathy taught me how to use those rules, and she taught me very, very well. Kathy was one of the smartest people you ever come across, and she was always very witty, also knew how to count votes.\nSpeaker 9: So in addition to taking me under her wing, as she did because my father had passed away and as dad, I have to mention so many other women that were on the council. Debbie Ortega, Ramona martinez. Happy Haines.\nSpeaker 9: They all really embraced me because I was Sam son. Sam had passed away and so they were helping me to understand the rules, how we worked, what we did. Well, these same women helped me with the very first major piece of legislation I was passing, and I was sitting right where Councilwoman Sandoval is sitting at the time\nSpeaker 9: . And I was waxing eloquent about how well we had done all the work that had happened. And then slowly a message from Councilwoman Reynolds, who happened to be present at that time, skipped across table to table to table till it got to me.\nSpeaker 9: And I opened it up and it said, You have seven votes. Keep on talking. You'll only have six. That was Kathy Runnels. She was sharp. She was quick. She was very and she also was very straight forward about the things that I needed to do and helped really for me to grow as a member of council.\nSpeaker 9: Now, as I look at the time. Oh, it's not from Kathy Reynolds, she said. You're talking too much. Thank you all very much.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you very much. Oh, we're going to go ahead and move back online because I believe we've got Elvira Wedgeworth. We've got her back in the queue. Yes.\nSpeaker 9: Can you hear me now? Hello? Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. Thank you. And good evening, Madam President, and members of the Denver City Council. My name is Alper Wedgeworth and I live in the Whittier neighborhood in Denver and District nine. I also wish to thank and acknowledge Councilwoman Glenn and Councilwoman Ortega for their efforts to name the Denver City Council Chambers in honor of Cathy Reynolds.\nSpeaker 9: I work with and personally knew Cathy Reynolds since 1989 when I began my public service career serving as a senior analyst on the Denver City Council staff. I worked directly with Kathy on some of her legislative policy issues regarding the ban of assault weapons in the city of Denver and many others.\nSpeaker 9: I was always impressed, very impressed with Kathy's thoughtfulness, her tenacity and her sense of humor. She was also always very kind and encouraging and a great steward of this institution. Kathy always encouraged me to learn and have a self-education on public policy in a way that would be balanced and also, to be fair, to approach all issues\nSpeaker 9: . Kathy was a very strong woman who was able to break down the stereotypes of leadership during that time. As was said tonight, very few women have this leadership role in government and to break those glass ceilings so other women would be able to follow.\nSpeaker 9: She was very determined. And at times quiet and always thoughtful and always grounded in her leadership and her ability to make a difference and to communicate and have to say again. She had a tremendous sense of humor. Kathy would always make you laugh about a lot of different things all the time.\nSpeaker 9: I truly appreciate also her courage and her confidence and her leadership and her passion. Our public service as she spoke, to be open for change and to be positive and proactive, suggesting things to you that you should consider.\nSpeaker 9: I will always be thankful to Kathy for her encouragement and her friendship and the many things I learned from her over the years. When I became the Denver City Council president myself. Kathy was many great things and woman of many accomplishments.\nSpeaker 9: Ever. I believe that she was proudest of being a wife, a mother, grandmother, and a friend mentor to everyone. Now and in the future. I will always think fondly of Kathy and the role she played in my journey of public service and her leadership on behalf of the city of Denver.\nSpeaker 9: I will always, always be thankful to her. To Rick and the family. We were blessed to have her in our lives, and we thank you for sharing her with us. So thank you, Cathy, and thank you, members of Council for your consideration.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Our next speaker is in chambers, Stephanie Foote. Good evening. Members of Council, um, councilman flynn and Councilwoman Ortega. You guys did just an incredible job that brings tears to my eyes to see these pictures of Cathy. Because I remember I was on council.\nSpeaker 0: I was elected in 1983 and I served three terms. I was a really a newbie to government, but I knew that in 1983 I had a nine month old baby and Mike, my campaign, when I talked to people, I said, if we don't do something right now, Denver's not going to be here when my kids grow up\nSpeaker 0: and there's not a place where they can work. I came to council. I had no idea how this process worked. I was I know you're going to find this hard to believe, but I was terrified. And I had to learn the rules.\nSpeaker 0: I had to watch what everybody else was doing. Cathy mentored me through all that, and then at the end of the first year, she took me in her office and as only Cathy could, she said, Steph, you've been here a year now.\nSpeaker 0: You can talk from that time on, whenever I needed any kind of guidance, I needed help. I needed to understand from the absolutely best public policy mind that I have ever known or been close to. She helped us all.\nSpeaker 0: All of us. I think that had the the beauty of spending time with her to gain that knowledge that we did not come here with. We dealt with huge issues. We you saw her list. We came in at the time.\nSpeaker 0: I came in with the new mayor, Mayor Federico Pena. And it was really a struggle to form coalitions, to understand what everybody's point of view was. But you all know that, and Cathy in particular, that we had to have all the arrows pointing in the same direction if we were going to do the right thing for Denver\nSpeaker 0: . So thank you all so much for this. This is just an incredible tribute. It couldn't go to someone more deserving. And Cathy, we love you and we miss you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Happy Hands.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening, Madam President and members of Council. My name is Happy Haines. I live in North Park Hill. Actually, I live mostly across the street these days as you live here. Thank you, Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman Ortega, for this brilliant idea.\nSpeaker 9: I can't think of a more fitting tribute to Cathy Reynolds. A real state's person and policy leader unparalleled. And hopefully it'll inspire a lot more wonderful decisions for many, many decades to come. Um, uh, I. I knew Cathy Reynolds the year she was elected was your first.\nSpeaker 9: The councilman that I served under as a council aide, served in the first, was elected that same year when that district was first created in northeast Denver around some concerns about equity in this city. And so I got to know Cathy Reynolds from on the perspective of a city council aide.\nSpeaker 9: So when I was elected, as many people here have said, Cathy was a mentor and she was more than that. She was a friend. But when I was first elected, I got called into the room to Stephanie and she told me that I would be consider myself proud to follow my predecessor in every respect but one, and\nSpeaker 9: that was to keep my speeches much briefer. And I tried to follow that advice most often. Um, but I think as was mentioned also, she was a teacher. I know Rick really was the teacher in the family, but Cathy was too.\nSpeaker 9: And she considered a government governance and public policy a lifelong learning experience. And so you've heard from the presentation all of the organizations that she belonged to, both locally and in this state and across this country. And she used those opportunities and encouraged all of us, likewise, to use those as learning experiences, because we didn't know at\nSpeaker 9: all here. She didn't know it all, none of us did. And so we could take advantage of what was happening across the state, across this country and constantly learn. And that's what she was in every organization. She was such an extraordinary leader.\nSpeaker 9: And Cathy was a kind of leader. She was a go to person in a get it done kind of person. So she believed in getting things done, not at the expense of principle, but she believed that there were always there was always a way, not only one way, but a way.\nSpeaker 9: And so she used her power of creating relationships and listening to people and connecting with people both inside this chamber and outside throughout the city to bring people together to hash it out. I never saw her run away from a fight, ever.\nSpeaker 0: But we're at our time. And so.\nSpeaker 9: I.\nSpeaker 0: Want to let you know.\nSpeaker 9: So thank you very much for allowing us.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. Next, the good guys, Scott, Scott Tucker. Scott Tucker. There you go.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Councilmember. My name is.\nSpeaker 3: Scott Tucker, and I was the.\nSpeaker 6: Executive director of the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District. And Kathy was my boss for 23 years. She was chairman of the board of the District. Kathy had a wonderful sense of humor. And I think you see something is kind of common as we go through this.\nSpeaker 6: But as she always referred to the UDV seed as a deferred, you'd f you D and I was always worried when she made presentations before like the in the Senate or the House and legislative issues. And I was always grateful when she did not use that term.\nSpeaker 6: You might remember the seventies and eighties were really.\nSpeaker 1: Very.\nSpeaker 6: Tumultuous times between the suburbs and in the city. Some of you might see some of the seasons, cities, season citizens might remember the POUNDSTONE amendment that restricted Denver's ability to annex. There were just a lot of difficulties there.\nSpeaker 6: The board of directors was made up of the mayor of Denver, three Denver council people, four mayors appointed by the governor from suburban communities and.\nSpeaker 1: Five county commissioners, and then two.\nSpeaker 6: Engineers appointed by the board. And she was able to handle them very, very nicely. And out of that mixture were 25 years of of getting things done. And that's, I thought was just really, really fantastic. She was very smart and intellectually, both intellectually and politically, and she had a wonderful way with people and of expressing yourself.\nSpeaker 6: And quite simply, people trusted Kathy and believed her. The highlight of the month for me when I was I meet with Kathy for lunch right before the board meeting two or three days before the board meeting, and that went on for 23 years.\nSpeaker 6: They added it up that it was not like 240 or 230 lunch meetings.\nSpeaker 1: We discuss the issues of drainage and.\nSpeaker 6: Flood control and all those arcane subjects. And finally, I'd like to thank Kathy and Rick. They introduced my family to Gilbert and Sullivan. And Rick, thank you very much for that refrigerator that and thank you very much for allowed to speak.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Tony Ogden.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening, Madam President. Good evening, members of the Council. My name is Tony Ogden and I, my husband and I currently reside in Portland, Oregon. I was a Denver resident from the early eighties to 2002, and I had the pleasure of working with candidate Kathy Reynolds on some key initiatives at that time.\nSpeaker 9: It is a privilege to be here to speak in support of this bill tonight, and my thanks to her for bringing it forward. You're going to hear lots of stories about Cathy. You've heard a lot of stories about Cathy.\nSpeaker 9: Her storied career precedes us. I will speak to one issue in particular. I lasted and testified before this council in 1990, when only one of you was a member of this council. Many of you also were here in support of Denver's Comprehensive Anti-Discrimination Bill Ordinance Number 623.\nSpeaker 9: I worked alongside several advocates in developing the original draft of that bill and helped found the Equal Protection Ordinance Coalition with the draft bill in hand. T shook and I knocked on Cathy Reynolds door in about 1988. Cathy opened the door wide for us and offered her support and sponsorship.\nSpeaker 9: There seems to be a no brainer today, but in the eighties and the nineties, rights for the LGBTQ community were still being hard to find. Few jurisdictions in the country had a gay rights bill. Only two other cities, Aspen and Boulder, in the state of Colorado, had an ordinance ordinance that included sexual orientation.\nSpeaker 9: When we first approached Cathy, she was working to an amendment amend Denver's ah zero zoning. And so we worked with Cathy and others to change the zero zoning because it would serve as the basically the foundation for us to be able to do the work on the Civil Rights Ordinance.\nSpeaker 9: Cathy was keen on political strategy, understood the importance of coalition building and of patients. Cathy did not shy away from and what was at times a very ugly and hateful opposition during that time. She was steadfast in her support through an attempted repeal of only the sexual orientation portion of the ordinance.\nSpeaker 9: The fight over amendment to and she celebrated with us vindication when the Supreme Court did decide Romer versus Evans. Kathy opened her door when many others would not. On this and so many other issues Kathy supported. She demonstrated leadership and is in the face of significant obstacles, not out of political gain, but out of true conviction, because\nSpeaker 9: it was the right thing to do for the people of the city and county of Denver. As others have and will continue to say about Kathy. She loved this city. She was dedicated to it and committed to making it a better place.\nSpeaker 9: I would go so far to say, as Cathy's leadership and courage in fighting discrimination is one reason Colorado has an openly gay governor today. I am proud to have worked with Kathy and to have regarded her a friend.\nSpeaker 9: Renaming Council Chambers in her honor speaks to what it means to be a public servant. Leadership. Dedication. Commitment. Honor. Integrity. Her name on this chamber will serve as a constant reminder of those values. I appreciate the opportunity to be here before you tonight and to urge your support of this bill.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Rick Reynolds.\nSpeaker 9: Oh, boy. Where? My glasses.\nSpeaker 1: Really?\nSpeaker 9: Sorry. First of all, I'd like to introduce my son, Matt. My son Bob. Kathy's boys. Thank you all for being here. My name is Rick Reynolds. I live in I am a Denver native and I live at 16th and Locust in Denver.\nSpeaker 9: How can anyone talk about three decades of service in only 3 minutes? I won't even try. But what was Denver like? Before Kathy Reynolds served? There were no women in city council. There were parts of Denver where unmarried couples could not live together and same sex marriage was illegal.\nSpeaker 9: Those couples did not enjoy the same rights as heterosexual people did. There was no convention center or convention center hotel. There was no city lobbyist at the state capital. The council members did not have a staff. Kathy how did the first one?\nSpeaker 9: Judy Gold. Neighborhood organizations were not and were not notified of zoning changes and liquor permits. One could legally own an assault weapon in Denver. There was no dedicated, dedicated funding for the developmentally disabled. There was no citizens oversight board or independent monitor.\nSpeaker 9: There was no cable TV in Denver. There were no Colorado Rockies or Colorado Avalanche. Coors Field did not exist. The 16th mall, the 16th Street Mall did not exist. The early Caulkins Opera House was in. It was a small arena for conventions and basketball games.\nSpeaker 9: The Better Concert Hall did not exist. Colorado Open Journey did not exist. The Bonfils Theater complex did not exist. DEA did not exist. Lowry was an Air Force base. Kathy had a huge hand in all of these changes.\nSpeaker 9: With these changes have happened without her. Maybe so over time. But she pushed them. In her own words. Kathy, if you ever wish to be a celebrity. What would you like to be famous for?\nSpeaker 3: I've had about all the celebrity I can handle from one time or another. What I'd like to be known for would be kindness, generosity.\nSpeaker 9: And good humor. I'll never know.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Ramona martinez. Well, good evening, members of city council.\nSpeaker 9: Madam President, it's this very difficult for a lot of us tonight to get up here and express how we feel about Cathy Reynolds. I met Cathy before she got elected to city council. We went to Washington, D.C. in 1974, a long time ago, and a women's conference that was for women in leadership to learn how to become\nSpeaker 9: leaders and leadership roles. Well, the city.\nSpeaker 0: Colorado's.\nSpeaker 9: Delegation is where I met Cathy because.\nSpeaker 0: We had lunch and dinner.\nSpeaker 9: Together during the week. We were out there in D.C.. And Cathy got elected right after that conference at Washington. A couple I don't know if it was a year or two later, but she got elected. I grew up in this city.\nSpeaker 9: I grew up in downtown Denver. I'm back in my city.\nSpeaker 0: In downtown Denver.\nSpeaker 9: I lived here all my life. There were never any male, any women on the city council when I was growing up. There were never. Except for album Colwell. I think he was the first minority to ever sit on this city council when I was growing up.\nSpeaker 9: And Kathy, she broke the glass ceiling for a lot of you up there. She broke it for me. Look at this.\nSpeaker 0: This council is now.\nSpeaker 9: Made up of the diversity that this city is all about. Not only did she help build and help us negotiate the Mile High Stadium, I sat with her as a member of the negotiating.\nSpeaker 0: Team for the New Mile High Stadium.\nSpeaker 9: She made.\nSpeaker 0: Sure.\nSpeaker 9: That minority participation was involved in our contracts. Denver International Airport. When we negotiated to get percentages, which of course the Supreme Court threw out, said it was unconstitutional. She supported our efforts. Hiawatha Davis, Happy Haines and I worked Debbie worked on that formative action program, goals for the airport.\nSpeaker 9: Cathy was right there supporting us, giving.\nSpeaker 0: Us the encouragement and negotiating those.\nSpeaker 9: Those type of agreements with all the developers in this city. She never back down from anybody. She taught me how to sit down and negotiate against and 17th.\nSpeaker 0: Street attorneys.\nSpeaker 9: And so did the news. We sat together on the mall and on the stadium, Mile High Stadium. I never did that before. I was just a kid from the west side that grew up in the city, never went to West High School, never thought I would be sitting on city council, never becoming the president like I became\nSpeaker 9: a president of the city council. But Cathy Reynolds broke that glass ceiling. Not for me, not just for me, but for all of you up there as well. So nothing is more appropriate than having this named after her.\nSpeaker 9: So thank you all for doing that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Judy Gold. Thank you, Madam President. Members of the City Council. My name is Judy Gold, and I live in Washington, D.C.. I am honored to be here this evening to speak in strong support of Council Bill 21 1322, to name this City Council Chambers for Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds.\nSpeaker 0: It was important for me to come all this way to speak. I worked for Cathy Reynolds for 18 years, from 1975 to 1993. I was the first council person, personal staff assistant ever hired in 3 minutes or 30 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: I cannot cover all that Cathy accomplished, but I will try to highlight some of her more creative legislative moments. Denver is a greater city today because of Cathy Reynolds. Her innovative work resulted in a way to issue municipal bonds that eliminate conflicts of interest.\nSpeaker 0: Psychological testing and training is now required for all police officers to ensure they are qualified to protect and serve, and women can become cops and firefighters. Cathy wrote a law increasing transparency between neighborhood groups in the city via direct lines of communications.\nSpeaker 0: In 1990, she authored and passed the gay rights bill that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Because of her, you have a ban on assault weapons that was also upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. She wrote The Denver law that allows women to seek lawful abortions without fear of harassment.\nSpeaker 0: But it was her day to day work that made Cathy most proud. Whether on economic development, housing, health and hospitals, the developmentally disabled or the city budget or even trash, potholes or zoning. Cathy put her heart and mind into all issues.\nSpeaker 0: She would cut a deal, but she would never sacrifice her principles. My favorite quote is from her first reelection way back in 1979, when I asked someone if you would vote for her, and he said yes, because he didn't always agree with her, but she would always give him the straight story and never change her position from\nSpeaker 0: one person to the next. That was and still is the best compliment ever, because her constituents always knew where she stood, whether or not they agreed with her. Councilwoman Kathy Carter. Reynolds was a unique person and an exceptional elected official.\nSpeaker 0: Her constant dedication, coupled with her wry sense of humor, gave her this rare characteristic that provided Denver with quality legislation, funding national recognition and a plan for the future. For all of these reasons and many more. It is extremely fitting that this council chambers be named for her in the future.\nSpeaker 0: When people ask, Who is Kathy Reynolds? Someone can explain. She was the best this wonderful city has to offer. I ask for your support. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Donna. Good.\nSpeaker 0: Donna. Good. Hi. I appreciate being asked to speak tonight. I'm done a good. And until ten days ago, I lived in Park Hill for the last 21 years. I moved into Councilman Black's district ten days ago, and I don't even know where I am.\nSpeaker 0: I got nosebleeds when I used to go above Alameda. So I think the reason I'm here tonight is to talk about something that you do hear about sometimes. But maybe we need to remember Cathy as somebody who accomplished everything we've heard about tonight.\nSpeaker 0: And maybe we need to remember for something that we've only heard touched on a couple of times. So I'm with commonly known as Political Hack. I've run 17 elections. I worked for two presidents, two mayors, two governors, and a bunch of other people in political office.\nSpeaker 0: And what I have learned in all those years is that you can spend time with people, you can work for them. And. They don't really care whether they're working for the people of a city. The people of a country, the people of a state.\nSpeaker 0: Or a major corporation. They don't. But what people who are really the ones who make the difference and I can recognize them right off because I've worked with so many of both kinds. But it's what Kathy stood for.\nSpeaker 0: I think L.B. mentioned it. Maybe Rosemary touched on it. Tony Ogden. Certainly. Sorry. Kathy had a passion for service. Kathy was the real deal. She cared about every one of us in Denver. And when people say she loved the city, I love Denver.\nSpeaker 0: And it means I love my neighborhood, I love my corner cafe. It means I love where I walk my dog. And no matter whether I was working in Pakistan or D.C., I kept the home in Denver, and Denver was home.\nSpeaker 0: Kathy loved not just the city, because what does that mean? What it means, I think, is that she loved us. She loved the people of Denver. She wanted us to have better health services. The ability to live in love as we stood.\nSpeaker 0: She wanted people who had never been given a chance to be given a chance. She wanted us to be able to take our family to different venues. She loved us. And maybe it's too late to say to her face, but we can say to her family and we can remind people forever by putting in this room that\nSpeaker 0: a woman worked here once who spent 28, almost 30 years her life every day dedicated to making this city a better place for each and every person who lived here. She was an early comer with things like LGBT rights.\nSpeaker 0: She fought for Denver Hill. She was the real deal. And I appreciate what you're all going to do tonight. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Tisha. He shook.\nSpeaker 9: Oh, goodness.\nSpeaker 0: Hi. I'm Tisha. I live in Council District 11. Hi. So I met Cathy with my small circle of friends. We're trying to get Denver to pass an equal protection ordinance in 1988. We were young and we were dedicated and we were as ignorant as all get out.\nSpeaker 0: Fortunately, there were wiser heads who decided to help us, and Kathy was one of those, as were most of the folks speaking tonight. Her support was crucial in the 1990 Council vote.\nSpeaker 9: In Oliver and I will just be forever grateful to.\nSpeaker 0: Her for all that.\nSpeaker 9: She did. To get that past and to stay with us every time it was fought over and over. Like many. She taught me how to count to seven. What was more important to me was that lesson, and it was a continuing lesson in how to work well with others.\nSpeaker 9: Especially those you disagree with. How wonderful.\nSpeaker 0: To name Council Chambers.\nSpeaker 9: For her. I really hope.\nSpeaker 0: That her name and her legacy serve to inspire future council members. Thank you, Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman Ortega for doing this. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Joyce Foster. And then we're going to follow with Martin Foley.\nSpeaker 0: I've. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the Denver City Council. It is truly a pleasure being in front of you this evening. This was my happiest job. I ran for election when Stephanie Foote was appointed by Mayor Webb to become his chief of staff.\nSpeaker 0: And I was recruited. To run. And the only time I ever had been down here was during the amendment that Kathy was running for. Well, if it wasn't for you. My husband was very involved with her. He was the co-chair of No.\nSpeaker 0: One to campaign. So I was elected as the first Jewish woman to sit on the Denver City Council and bring that community with me. And I had no idea how many people sat on the city council when I entered the race.\nSpeaker 0: I was very naive. I had been working for Jewish family service for 17 years and my whole life I had been recruited. I had been resettling immigrants from the former Soviet Union, from Laos boat people and helping them find jobs and homes.\nSpeaker 0: That's what I did for a living. And after I was elected, my first job on city council was to break a tie on who was to be elected city council president. It was between Cathy Reynolds, who I knew a little bit from the the work that she did with my husband and another gentleman who will go nameless\nSpeaker 0: . I really thought, well, she's been here so long. She's been president of city council. I'll add somebody else. I'll vote for somebody else. So I voted for the other guy. Whoa. Was that a bad move on my part?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I was soon to lose my best friend, and I apologized about a year later after I saw and was learning. You know what she did and how well she did it? And I did apologize. And I said, whenever you run for city council president again, I promise I'm going to support you because you are really smart\nSpeaker 0: . You're thoughtful. You're respectful. And she's really, really smart. Really smart. And I loved Kathy. She became such a good friend. And Steven and I miss her. We miss Rick. We miss our community. I was on the council for ten years until I was term limited and.\nSpeaker 0: Sometimes we would get together and just visit and it was wonderful. And I miss Kathy and I can't imagine a better name for this cherished hall, this treasure that we have in Colorado. So I definitely support this bill.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Or whatever it is. It's. Thank you. Our next speaker is Martin Place.\nSpeaker 9: Members of council. Hi, my name is modestly. I'm a Capitol Hill resident for about 50 years. But probably the longer stake is that I was a city employee for 37 years. Most of that was as a career employee.\nSpeaker 9: I was an appointee for under Mayor Webb, and then I was a contract employee. So I sort of every flavor of employee you can have. And I go back to when Kevin Flynn was one of those annoying reporters in City Hall and Debbie was a legislative aide, if I remember correctly, when we first met.\nSpeaker 9: So those are the familiar faces on council. Kevin, I should have asked you, was this a promotion or a demotion going from reporter this. So I started five years before Cathy Reynolds became a member of council, had occasion to work with her on a whole host of other of issues because I was the face of the finance\nSpeaker 9: office for a much of that time. The main thing I want to affirm is how the extraordinary leadership and sense of service that Cathy demonstrated, manifested and that we others were able to learn from. I knew it. The mayors knew it.\nSpeaker 9: The council members knew it. And the people knew it. If you wanted to find out what the straight story is, you talk to Cathy Reynolds. She was also a friend. And I'm very grateful that you're recognizing her in this way.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We wanted to see if we might have Wellington Webb in the Zoom platform. All right. Okay. Well, we tried. We will go ahead and move forward then. That concludes our speakers this evening. Thank you, everyone, for sharing your memories and perspective of her and questions from members of Council on Council.\nSpeaker 0: Bill. One, three, two, two. All right. Seen no questions by members of council. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill one, three, two, two. And I hope that we might start out with council members Flynn and Ortega, and we can follow with other members of council after they go.\nSpeaker 6: Certainly. Thank you, Madam President. I don't want to lengthen the mindful of what Tim Sanders had said. I want to have a note pass down from Council President Gilmore, but I just want to thank everybody for showing up and reminding folks of what public service is all about, what change is all about, and what meeting the challenge\nSpeaker 6: of change is all about, and what it takes to do that. And a number of the people in this room who worked with Cathy in accomplishing that. Really tell that story. It was a group effort. It took a leader, but it took the whole village.\nSpeaker 6: Really? Ramona Councilwoman Martinez, your words really, really struck me. And still to this day, your story of how you grew up here and then became yourself president of the council and with the help of Councilwoman Reynolds mentorship. When you worked for Sam and then later when you joined her as a as an equal colleague.\nSpeaker 6: Every time I come to this building, I drive by the house that you told me you grew up in, that tiny little bungalow. I can imagine that the little girl who grew up in that rose to the accomplishments that you did and having broken, having benefited from the glass ceiling that that Kathy Reynolds broke.\nSpeaker 6: And I and I would have similar remarks for everyone else in the room for for former Councilwoman Haynes, for Councilwoman Foster. Councilwoman Foote. Am I missing anybody? Councilwoman Marcia Johnson was your. Councilman Santos this I can't imagine a better way to memorialize the record of accomplishment that she had than in naming this room.\nSpeaker 6: As I said at the end of the presentation, this room where it happened, it's the appropriate place to do it. We have memorialized other people by naming elements of buildings. John Parr, Sandy Weidner, we've recognized with the PA Weidner room, and I think this is a crowning honor for a career that really changed Denver.\nSpeaker 6: And with that, Madam President, I would certainly ask for everyone's support for this bill. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. So I had the pleasure of being a council aide along with Judy Gold, along with Ramona martinez, Happy Haines. During the time that she had first got elected in her first term, and we all went on to accept, Judy, to replace the council members that we served with\nSpeaker 0: , she was an inspiration to all of us to want to to be like her, to want to make a difference in our community, and to step into those big shoes that were filled by our predecessors. And, you know, to see that we still have this many women serving on the council.\nSpeaker 0: She truly did break that glass ceiling for for all of us. And she was she was a dear friend. We all loved her. I mean, just the fact that this many of her former colleagues are here tonight to express those words of appreciation and love that we all had for her.\nSpeaker 0: I just thank you all for being here tonight. And I really would appreciate a unanimous support of this bill tonight so that we could officially change the name of this chamber after one of our great leaders, Kathy Reynolds.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Kinney.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Council President. I am part of the next generation right of council members. So unlike some of the folks who are here tonight, I didn't serve as a council aide and I was a young mom a and looking to run for office as the first out member of the council.\nSpeaker 8: We don't know. There may have been other LGBTQ members, but the first one to kind of run as an out individual and Maria Garcia Berry made the introduction and said, you need to meet Cathy. And not just because you're running for the At-Large seat, because you and Cathy, Cathy, Cathy, you know, had a brand of leadership that\nSpeaker 8: she she thought I needed to understand and know about. And it was pretty intimidating, actually, to learn about her history in the office and, you know, to be someone who didn't come from inside the city family, because that was clearly something that was really important to a lot of Cathy and her predecessors.\nSpeaker 8: And so but I also was really inspired. It struck me the first time I met her, like I might not even have the opportunity to run for an office like this with the background I have, if it weren't for Cathy.\nSpeaker 8: And so I was so nervous too to try to live up to this idea that and people would ask me, they'd say, you know, what do you want to do as the first out lesbian in city council? Like what big policies are you going to run for the community?\nSpeaker 8: And I would say. The important thing to understand is that straight allies paved the way. That it took those from communities who had not lived in the shoes of being a gay person to pass laws that were inclusive.\nSpeaker 8: And that was really important to me, thinking about being a leader, right? When I worked on immigrant issues, I have not walked the shoes of an immigrant in our city or in our country. But having to think about I can't wait for for for only people with that background to lead or, you know, police accountability where, you\nSpeaker 8: know, we have a huge community of individuals of color and men of color in particular, to whom police accountability is really important. I can't only represent that issue if I've walked in their shoes. Cathy inspired me and sent the message that you have to lead for all of those communities with their experience and partnership, right?\nSpeaker 8: Hearing TE and others talk about how she worked with you and that model of trying to see, I might not have walked in those shoes, but if I can be alongside you, right? Those are the things that I took.\nSpeaker 8: And in my early terms on the council, I would get the short emails. You know, some of you might have served before the email era, but I would get the short email from Cathy and I would pretty much know in that one sentence if she liked or did not like a quote in the paper or a vote\nSpeaker 8: that I had taken. And I learned to pick up the phone and call her, especially when she didn't like it and she was so curious. She would always actually want to hear why I had voted differently than she thought.\nSpeaker 8: And she never cut me off, right? She never was like, You're dead to me because you voted against. She would say, okay, well, I hate it, but you know, and then we'd move on and I'd get the next email and I had done okay.\nSpeaker 8: She was still serving on the Citizens Oversight Board in my first term, and that was a topic that we talked about right when there were some hard moments. Our our former monitor had a little more contentious relationship with our safety agencies than our most recent monitor did.\nSpeaker 8: And she, as someone who loved the city, loved the mayor and loved the safety agencies, was also really willing to hold them accountable. She did not think those two things were mutually exclusive. And I continue to feel that same way that I can love the city while also wanting us to do better and holding us accountable to\nSpeaker 8: those high standards. So those are the things I've taken personally. And as her health began to struggle, we tried to remember her in these chambers in terms of celebrating the anniversaries of the nondiscrimination ordinance as part of the history.\nSpeaker 8: And I remember going to visit her at the house. And I will just say for me personally, I often heard from Rick and Cathy together. I kind of feel like I got to know you together. And it's for me very fitting that so much of her service you are so involved in.\nSpeaker 8: And so I want to say thank you to you as well, because that inspiration, the trust, the watchful eye, all of that, I feel like was really something you did as a team, and it meant a lot to me, even though I did not work with her in the same way you all did.\nSpeaker 8: I felt that mentorship and I felt that support and I felt those high standards and they made me a better councilwoman. So thank you to all of you for the service that you performed for our city and thank you to her family.\nSpeaker 8: We know a little bit about the shared sacrifice that a family has for service. And so I thank you for the last dinners, the interrupted birthdays and all the other things that helped make her service to our city so possible.\nSpeaker 8: So I'm really excited and thank you to my colleagues for bringing this forward. I think you found the perfect place. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Kenney, Councilman Cashman.\nSpeaker 3: Know. Thank you, Madam President. I thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Flynn, for bringing this this forward. This this pretty humbling for me. I've been I grew up in the Garden State of New Jersey. And on Halloween night, just a couple of weeks ago, I celebrated my 50, 50 years in Colorado, all of that, except for maybe one\nSpeaker 3: year in the city and county of Denver. And for a long time as a journalist, I had a community newspaper in South Denver. I spoke to a number of the folks in the room here, including Councilwoman Reynolds. But what I'm remembering when I when I was thinking about running and was even 13 or 14, I called my\nSpeaker 3: friend Lynn Preston Hall, who was an aide for Councilwoman Johnson. And I said, you know, how much time does this job take? And she said, Well, you know, she said, Paul, it would be up to you. You know, some people talk about working and then others of them actually work.\nSpeaker 3: And she said, My boss works so. I took that to heart and I've tried to work. I don't know that I would ever even aspire to the heights that Ms.. Reynolds achieved, but I do try to try to work.\nSpeaker 3: You know, I did speak with Councilwoman Reynolds a few times as a journalist, and I found her to be as described by some of the speakers. She was always would return my call, but she did not seem to be a particular fan of talking to the press, and she was always very direct.\nSpeaker 3: She would explain fully, answer my questions fully, but she was not a look at me person. She was. My sense was she was a let's let's get it done type of person. And as I said, you know, she was very direct and to the point.\nSpeaker 3: But I did she had the opportunity to see another side of her. The sense of humor that people talk about. I happened to be as actually to I believe that were Fridays to Fridays in a row. I happened to be playing golf over on a golf course and came off the first green.\nSpeaker 3: And there was this woman laughing her tail off on the second tee about 20 yards away and got a little bit closer. And it was Councilwoman Reynolds and I don't know what the topic was, but she was laughing about 200 yards down the fairway and having a great time.\nSpeaker 3: So I was pleased to hear that side of her. And the other thing I wanted to comment about when I first got elected to office, Albert Brooks was president at the time of council, and he appointed me. To the Urban Drainage and Flood Control Board, and who knew what that could possibly be?\nSpeaker 3: And why would I have been subjected to this? And what I came to find out, first of all, is it is one of the most well-run, marvelous organizations I've ever had the privilege to be associated with. I want to acknowledge Dave Bennetts, who's I think government relations manager now for the district and has had a remarkable career\nSpeaker 3: for that organization. And the other thing I want to say is when I took the position and Councilwoman Sussman was just leaving that role on the board, the only thing she had to tell me, she came over and whispered.\nSpeaker 3: She said, you had the best lunches you're ever going to eat. So, yeah, they they do a good job in that way. But I do want to thank all all the former council members here, former attorney muse Mr. Reynolds, and all the family members for for what you did in setting the table so all of us can\nSpeaker 3: be up here working for a city that's with all of its challenges in pretty good shape. So thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. Councilmember Hines.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council President, I this is my first term in office and I never met Miss Reynolds. Did not know her. I. Would say tonight, I want to thank the sponsors for their fabulous presentation. And and I want to thank the folks here in this room.\nSpeaker 3: It's just been such a delight to learn more about Ms.. Rental, Ms.. REYNOLDS And what a force she has been in our city. And I am also speaking of delight. I am delighted that she broke a barrier and helped us become, as you have already said, such a diverse council with majority women council, too.\nSpeaker 3: And so I just wanted to thank everyone for coming. I feel a little bit I feel like I know her a little bit better, and I'm excited to have this chambers named after her. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Hines. Councilmember Sandoval.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Madam President. Um, so I never had the honor of knowing Cathy, but I know my father, Paul Sandoval, did, and worked with her a great deal. And as a daughter of someone who was elected, I had to share my dad with the community.\nSpeaker 5: And I remember going places with my dad, and I would get tired of him talking to everyone. And I would just want my dad's attention. And we would go to on a cruise. I'll never forget we were in Mexico and my dad knew someone on the cruise in Mexico.\nSpeaker 5: And it all revolved around Denver politics. And so as a woman who is now currently elected and I have two children at home, I know the strain my dad carried and the strain that she probably carried of being a mother and being a wife and being a politician.\nSpeaker 5: And now I see my kids. I go places and my kids are like, Mom, come on, let's go. Do we have to keep talking? And so I just wanted to thank her family, her husband, who sat by her side.\nSpeaker 5: My husband's been there for me. I don't think anyone really knows what that's like. And her kids who she had, you had to share your mom with the community and what that feels like of people telling you stories about your mom that you didn't know and exploring things and hearing things.\nSpeaker 5: When I was campaigning, I learned more about my dad than I had known. I didn't know. I knew he had a big impact in northwest Denver, but I really learned it. Going knocking door to door and hearing. So just wanted to thank her family because this is a job where you don't get to go home when you\nSpeaker 5: just turn it off. You don't. You're everywhere you go. You're Councilwoman Sandoval. You're not the story. And so thank you for her family, for standing by her side for so long and standing in her, because I'm sure she needed to come home and she rented to you all, just like we all as mothers up here and fathers\nSpeaker 5: go home. And we went to our significant other in our kids. And so we're all in it together. And for all of you, other women who were elected, thank you for opening the door for me and for my family and for my ability to serve Northwest Denver and get things done.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval and see no other speakers in the queue. I'll go ahead and round it out tonight. I want to sincerely thank council members Flynn and Ortega for sponsoring this. And I see when Council member Flynn started to try to go down the roll call, it makes it tough.\nSpeaker 0: So I would just like to acknowledge and sincerely and humbly thank the former council members who are here with us this evening as well and online. You know, some of the things that were said about Kathy Reynolds tonight were she was a strong woman.\nSpeaker 0: She was a visionary. She was a passionate servant. She was a get it done sort of person. Her humor, her patience, her kindness and her generosity. Were things that you said over and over again in a little bit different way, but it gave us an opportunity sitting up here tonight to fill.\nSpeaker 0: For the ones of us that never met her, feel like we knew her just a little bit. And the humility and. Just great honor that it is to sit up here and serve our city and know the intentional work that it does take to do this job to the best of your ability and to her husband and\nSpeaker 0: her two children. I know a couple of my colleagues brought it up, but your sacrifices, because I think that she couldn't serve for almost 30 years and there weren't sacrifices that you all made as family. And that sacrifice changed policy and legislation in Denver for the betterment of citizens that you will never meet.\nSpeaker 0: But she did that and you allowed her to do that because having the support of your family members, when you go home to not talk about what happened, to talk about what happened in your life and in your day is so refreshing and so important for us to be able to continue doing our jobs and the coalition\nSpeaker 0: building. How she served on the the Citizen Oversight Board. Women's rights. I have two daughters and I want them to consider public service at some point. I want them to know that it's achievable for them and that they can do that and have a city or have excuse me, have a family and still serve the city in\nSpeaker 0: a good way, but that you're also serving your family at the same time. And so I'm very honored to support this this evening. And, Madam Secretary, roll call, please. Flynn.\nSpeaker 6: Just checking what the snow says. I don't have seven votes. I.\nSpeaker 0: Ortega, i. And we would like to ask council members who are in the chambers to all please stay so we can take a group photo with you and our seated council.\nSpeaker 7: I think Sandoval. Sawyer.\nSpeaker 0: I. Torres, I. Black. I.\nSpeaker 7: See tobacco.\nSpeaker 5: I. Clark.\nSpeaker 6: I.\nSpeaker 0: Herndon.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 3: Times i.\nSpeaker 7: Cashman.\nSpeaker 0: Can I?\nSpeaker 7: Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: I. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results.\nSpeaker 7: 13 eyes.\nSpeaker 0: 13. I count the bill. 21 guy. 13. 20. They're being for no further business before this body. This meeting is adjourned. Thank you.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 11: Everyone there. Okay. So I know this has come up in a number of questions that I've received from the council, and I'll read it as follows. The current annual cost of adding a fire marshal at the division chief level is estimated at 300.\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry, I don't. Hey, we're. We're lost. Okay. Where is it? Is it Page? It says page four at the bottom of the page.\nSpeaker 11: No, it says page four or five at the top. It's the staff report. So if everyone's on the staff report.\nSpeaker 7: Okay.\nSpeaker 9: Oh, it's page eight.\nSpeaker 5: Sorry.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. I'm sorry. I guess my copy is different.\nSpeaker 5: That's okay. We have the.\nSpeaker 11: That's right. So the top of page eight, it sounds like just below the top bullet points. That should be the sentence reading the current. Okay, these are perfect.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We are literally on the scene.\nSpeaker 11: No problem. Now we're on the same page, kid. So it says the current annual cost of adding a fire marshal. The division chief level is estimated at 355,000. That is a true statement, and I'll expand on that with the next sentence.\nSpeaker 11: This includes salary and benefits, but does not include long term powers increases. The direction I received from council last July was to come back full four fold with what we have for you tonight. Look at a fire marshal position that's fully paid by a fee increase.\nSpeaker 11: Conductor fee increase on our fire prevention fees. Look at two new EMS fees for your consideration and also make some edification to our fire code analysis. That's what we're presenting for you tonight. I want to say that that figure of 355,000 does include, with all of our benefits, with all of our positions, doesn't include the current OPEB\nSpeaker 11: and PERS unfunded liability costs when we talk about this, don't include long term personnel increases. As you know, every one or two years we go through another actuarial recurs and sometimes those costs rise. So if they do rise in the future, I think you'll see through this presentation that we have a number of cost of living increases\nSpeaker 11: and also fee increases to cover proposed additional costs. So that as your chief, I'm saying that in the future and today, if this is approved this evening, there will be no impact to the general fund to add this position.\nSpeaker 11: So I just wanted to be upfront and clarify that if I could before I started our presentation.\nSpeaker 0: Mayor So you said there would be no impact to the general fund, but it doesn't include the increased cost of PERS.\nSpeaker 11: No, no position today knows or has the increase in PERS costs. We would come back to you and adjust the rates or the fees based on those in the future.\nSpeaker 0: So what you're saying is at this point in time, it is a true and correct view of the cost with the current PERS obligations.\nSpeaker 11: Exactly. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Chief.\nSpeaker 11: So we have a very brief PowerPoint presentation for you this evening. Again, I want to get into kind of our study and we have NBC's representatives in the audience today. NBC was the firm that we've been working with.\nSpeaker 11: You'll see a lot of them. They're actually doing a study of all city fees. So when Public Works comes back, Parks and Rec, the police department, building, community development, they're also doing their fee studies. Our fees were last study in 2013.\nSpeaker 11: And as we know, our cost to provide services have increased significantly over that time period. We needed to utilize an outside study firm. Staff doesn't have the capacity to do it. We did internalize and study some of our fees we're going to propose tonight, but the fire prevention fees were all done by our consultant.\nSpeaker 11: We also wanted to look at our 2016, which is our most current California fire code, to make sure that as we develop and as Alameda grows, that we capture systems or programs to inspect and have fees aside for those that we don't have today.\nSpeaker 11: So we wanted to be as comprehensive and forward looking for you as we could. We want to improve our false alarm, fire response and fees. Right now we have a six month rotation and our recommendation is to go to an annual basis, as we do every fee based on an annual basis.\nSpeaker 11: We'll talk more about that. We also have fee changes that cover the full cost, as we talked about, of the fire marshal position and that we're going to propose to you to increase the division's entire division's cost recovery rate from its current 24% to 48%, starting very shortly to 59% in year four.\nSpeaker 11: And we'll talk about that. Also would like the authorization for my office to handle fee increase and code exceptions when you deal with the fire code. There's a number of exceptions that come up with different codes. And we're asking you for the authorization to have my office and the chief the chief officer assigned as a fire marshal\nSpeaker 11: to deal with those in the future. So we have again four recommendations for this tonight. Mayor and council adopt the proposed annual fire prevention fees as we discussed and the implementation schedule. Add one full time equivalent division chief to the Fire Prevention Staffing.\nSpeaker 11: Adopt the proposed new cost recovery fees, emergency medical services and vehicle accident cost recovery that we'll talk more about. Authorize the fire chief and my designee to administer the fee increase and code exceptions and modify the false warrant fee schedule from a six month rotation to annual based on all the other fees to be consistent.\nSpeaker 11: So when you look at our fee charges right now, our current hourly rates averages about $105 an hour to conduct an inspection. That's all staff time, preparation, building code research, walking on premise. That's kind of our standard fee, and that was the basis for doing the study.\nSpeaker 11: We're proposing that beginning very shortly after your approval tonight, that that rate increase to $150 per hour, which would increase our collection rate overall to 48%, followed by another increase next fiscal year in 2021, $280 an hour increase in the collection percentage rate to 57%.\nSpeaker 11: And then remaining kind of a just a cost neutral at that one year period for $180. Still maintaining 50% cost recovery. But then in 2022, 23, upping the fee to $200 to maintain a 59% cost recovery rate. Mayor, at your suggestion, when we met first to talk about this, you asked me to meet with our business community\nSpeaker 11: . So myself and our deputy chief met with our Chamber of Commerce, Waba Dhaba, all the associations who have written letters of support saying that they were very nice, that we stopped by the we told them the fee structure proposals that we have before you.\nSpeaker 11: We do have a smoothing out. We're increasing this over a four year period. It was very powerful to businesses and they were very thankful for that. So I believe the clerics provided you with that support letter also from the chamber.\nSpeaker 11: Again, we talk about the full cost of the fire marshals, 355,000 to pay for that, we have kind of the rate proposal below you. We know how many billable hours of work we can do in a year with our current staff, with the proposed increase before you and the additional proposed increases in reinspection fees will more than\nSpeaker 11: cover the first year. Total compensation and benefits of the fire marshal positions we talked about. So we always want to look at how our fees compare to other East Bay communities. And again, with the first proposed increase of $150 an hour, if you look at the graph before you, you can see that we're still well below the\nSpeaker 11: medium of what most communities in the East Bay charge a high would be Hayward, which is and these are hourly rates. So here we're designing an $85 an hour, followed by Walnut Creek at 837, the lowest there is, obviously San Leandro at 120 currently and then plan reviews and both inspections.\nSpeaker 11: We charge the same per hour. And because it's one hour staff time for those even after the the average they're excluding Alameda is $440 an hour so 150. When we show this to our business community there are gracious and obviously we're trying to recover more cost but obviously mindful of the cost to businesses and we want to\nSpeaker 11: be competitive in our region and I think still maintain that we do have that competitive service for you tonight. Even after the rates are all set at $200 an hour, we're still really well below what most East Bay cities charge for similar services.\nSpeaker 11: So again, as we move forward in that fourth year. So I want to talk about the two new fees before you, the proposed TMS cost recovery fee. Emir staff did a comprehensive three and five year time task in response time study to develop.\nSpeaker 11: What does it cost us to provide service on an EMS call, a medical call? And is that is that amount fully cost recoverable? And there are some instances where it is and we'll talk about that tonight and ultimately ask for your approval of that.\nSpeaker 11: So when you look at what it costs to run in an emergency, obviously we look at the crew costs. We look at dispatch costs of supplies used. There's a vehicle excuse me, a vehicle involved. And we have the city's administrative rate, which fluctuates every year.\nSpeaker 11: So we know now that a three person crew for an hour of time, which is our standard, including all benefits, including, again, OPEB in long term PERS, it's about $223 an hour. Our dispatch cost currently this year, it's about $42 per call.\nSpeaker 11: We pay a flat rate every year, but if you break it down into a per call charge, it comes out to $42. We use an average of about $20 in medical supplies, gloves, I.V. supplies, bandages on a medical call.\nSpeaker 11: Our Cities City's having rate at that current rate is $50. So it gives us an accurate picture that it costs us about $380 to run a single EMS incident. So with that, that was our basis for developing the true cost recovery amount or factor to determine what those costs are and how we would propose moving forward.\nSpeaker 11: So when we look at our proposed EMS cost recovery and the process, what we're proposing to do is include this as a bundled charge within our ambulance transport invoice. We have a third party biller that can do that.\nSpeaker 11: And even though we're building every patients that we transport, we will not collect those funds from every patient. And I'll kind of speak to that a little bit. Currently, right now, under state and federal law, only the private health insurers, Kaiser Blue Shield, Aetna, will pay a fire department for the first responder costs.\nSpeaker 11: That makes up of our total patients transported about 19%. So we use that 19% factor in developing of 100% billing out. We're really only going to recover about 19% of the bills that are out there. What this does mirror and counsel that protects our elderly who are on Medicare primarily and are indigent, who are on Medi-Cal.\nSpeaker 11: Those two health care coverages do not pay for the first responder fees. So even though we include them with the bill, they're not going to provide us coverage or funding back for that. They both have pre-defined already agreed to amounts of reimbursement.\nSpeaker 11: So there's no haggling with Medicare Medi-Cal. We can send them a bill for any amount. They're still only going to give us X, Y, Z back for that transport. So again, this does not affect our elderly, our most vulnerable in our community.\nSpeaker 11: We're really going after the dollars that the private health insurers have set aside for this and trying to collect that. Right now, we have close to 5000 billable EMS responses every year. That number grows every year. So our estimated annual cost recovery, again, of only the insured patients, is an additional revenue to the city of $332,000 per\nSpeaker 11: year. So we're proposing to enact that this evening before you. The next cost recovery that we'd ask you to consider. The saving, too, is for everyone that has general vehicle insurance. There is a small fee set aside within your insurance coverage that covers the event if you were to be involved in a vehicle accident.\nSpeaker 11: And when you think about it, that makes sense. If you're involved in a vehicle accident, you're going to have a large response. More than likely, you may be injured, which would promulgate a response from the fire department or an ambulance.\nSpeaker 11: You may need medical transportation. You may be trapped. You may need the jaws of life extrication equipment. So there is a portion of your overall medical coverage that reimburses first responder agencies, ambulance companies, even police departments for the cost of providing that service.\nSpeaker 11: Mayor and Council. When we look at what it takes us to run a vehicle accident response, it's identical to the same time, the same crew size, the same response, the same dispatch costs. They're identical to what our EMS cost recovery fee is.\nSpeaker 11: So the methodologies are identical. And when we look at the two fees, one, we're building health insurance companies. This one, we will actually build someone's auto insurance company. So we would collect what the auto insurance pays us. Right now, we average a five year study, about 200 vehicle accidents a year here in Alameda.\nSpeaker 11: We don't have a very high volume. We don't have freeway systems. But that's that's a good average that we went with. And we estimate our annual cost recovery could be about $70,000 with that fee once instituted. So again, I want to give you a cost recovery comparison of what other East Bay communities are doing.\nSpeaker 11: There's a number of them up and down the state, including those locally that have adopted EMS cost recovery fees. You can see the high would probably the Central Valley Fire District at just under $500. City Berkeley's about 425.\nSpeaker 11: Our proposed is 388. If you do an average of the fees, an average of about $383. So our fee cost recovery is is about the median of what most East Bay communities charge. Again, I can't speak to the studies that these other departments did, but I know that these are hard and fast and true costs for recovery\nSpeaker 11: that we can obviously stand by. Mm hmm. I want to talk, mayor and council about what the future of EMS cost recovery looks like, because I think it's important to understand from what your fire chief is looking at, not only locally, but statewide, but also what I ask my staff on a daily basis to look at.\nSpeaker 11: So looking at this, we're going to see some significant changes from the Medicare health care program. When you look at the patients we transport, and this is true for almost every public agency that provides ambulance transportation like the city of Alameda.\nSpeaker 11: Medicare is always the number one provider of our insured dollars. As we grow older and we get on Medicare, that's what we tend to have the most health problems and the probable need for ambulance services. So it makes sense that the majority of our patients are over 65 and those are who we transport.\nSpeaker 11: So Medicare is looking to do a roll out next year. And this is a combination fee structure that's been developed and been in the process for a number of years by the Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Firefighters.\nSpeaker 11: And really this was actually going to be implemented two years ago. But what stopped it was a simple nomenclature to the service. Medicare provides reimbursement to two types of entities a provider and a supplier. Right now for ambulance transport, we're considered a provider.\nSpeaker 11: A provider has a designated cost that's non-negotiable. And it's a take it or leave it. So when we build Medicare, even though our average bill may be 2000, we're going to recoup about $627. That's just what Medicare pays.\nSpeaker 11: They only pay for the base rate. They pay for the administration of oxygen and they pay us a nominal fee to transport per mile to a hospital. What this does now is make us a supplier of health care where we're now able to negotiate what our true costs are.\nSpeaker 11: Now, they're not going to take a makeup number, and we can't say it costs us $6 million for every transport or something like that, as you can imagine. But by adopting these fees and having done this study and knowing that our costs are 388 per call, I'll give you a snapshot of where these fees potentially could go\nSpeaker 11: . So if you looked at the other slide, we proposed about 350 something thousand dollars as an average. You could see that almost doubling because this would pay us for a higher rate of reimbursement on top of transport. So you're looking at almost a quarter of three quarters of $1,000,000 of additional revenue.\nSpeaker 11: So we're closely monitoring that. It looks like we're going to see a roll out of that in 2020. So as we know, we'll bring this back to you and certainly ask you to implement it because that's obviously less of a general fund impact that the fire department can contribute back for the services that we provide that are\nSpeaker 11: crucial to our community. One big thing I want to discuss that just came up this year that was actually stopped last year is if you look at the center of this slide, have initials called IGT. IGT stands for intergovernmental transfer.\nSpeaker 11: That is a process where most counties and county hospital systems derive their additional funding through both Medicare and Medicare. Essentially, it pays them for costs that just like us as a provider of health care. We were only given so much back, but at the end of the day, we look at our true cost.\nSpeaker 11: We send in an audit sheet and they provide us additional funding that is going to be made available to public transport agencies in California. I'm proud to say that that bill is an assembly bill is actually being sponsored, authored by Assemblymember Bonta.\nSpeaker 11: So we're very happy that Rob jumped on that as assisting us moving that forward. Now, what that does is right now we're in part of a program called the G EMT program. GMT is an acronym for Ground Emergency Medical Transport.\nSpeaker 11: That gives us annually about another $240,000 average over the last five years. That pays for additional transport costs for Medi-Cal patients. We're fortunate that we don't have a lot of Medi-Cal patients here in Alameda. We have a pretty good payer mix as opposed to more most cities in the East Bay.\nSpeaker 11: But we do have a fair amount of Medi-Cal that additional revenue does help offset our costs. What this would do would take us out. This bill would take us out of that GMT program and put us into an IGT program.\nSpeaker 11: So if we look at right now, Medicare pays us about $357 per transport on the formula here. That makes up about half of our transports, which are about 2000 average per year, and that's the cost of our transport.\nSpeaker 11: Our loss per transport is 1600 dollars. 1643 IGT would cover that loss in addition to what we originally received, so we could look at potentially another $3.3 million in revenue to the city starting in 2020, maybe early 2021.\nSpeaker 11: I'll give you an idea. Statewide, the GMT program right now reimburses public agencies. It's about 105 to $110 million program. Switching to an IGT would make that statewide a $1.5 billion program. So you can see the significant amount of additional potential revenue down the road.\nSpeaker 11: So we're fortunate that we are a transport history. We have tours and rights to that. We certainly have your supported council to continue that. But I think you see there's a significant amount of future revenue associated with that that we'll keep our eye on.\nSpeaker 11: And as soon as we can definitely catch that, we'll bring it back to council for your edification and ultimate support and review. So I wanted to give you kind of where we're looking at what the future of EMS cost recovery.\nSpeaker 11: And I think you'll see that by knowing what our fees are today, by having done this study on what our true costs are to respond. We're well set up to be that supplier of health care because we've done the study and we can quantify what it costs us to go to a medical call.\nSpeaker 11: And we're probably much more positioned in many communities to to be at the forefront of collecting those additional reimbursements in the future. Mayor and council. With that again, I'll leave you with our recommendations tonight for your hopeful support.\nSpeaker 11: We're asking that you implement the proposed fire prevention fees incrementally over the next four years. We, as we proposed, add one full time division fire chief marshal position to the Fire Prevention Bureau, implement the two new cost recovery fees.\nSpeaker 11: I spoke about EMS and vehicle action cost recovery authorize the fire chief on the code exceptions we talked earlier and make it a small change in our fee schedule to reflect that we monitor fire false alarms going from a six month rotation to an annual rotation.\nSpeaker 11: If you look at how the fee structures are laid out before you council, you'll know that, yes, we don't know what future long term PERS increases are OPEB liabilities, but we have some natural increases to the hourly rates that continue to build that cost recovery factor and add additional revenue over that four year period.\nSpeaker 11: In addition, in your resolution, we also can enact a you're at your approval cost of living increases if our costs accelerate beyond that. So what I'm specifying to you this evening is we're always going to keep those cost recovery numbers at the same and ensure that the addition of the fire marshal position has no impact in the\nSpeaker 11: future to the general fund. So with that Mayor Council, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have or the public council members.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have any clarifying questions about this staff report? Not this time. I think they have a couple. See here, Chief Rodriguez, the on page three of my my staff report. This is the section that says phe study results.\nSpeaker 7: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Are you there? Okay. So in the.\nSpeaker 7: Uh.\nSpeaker 0: In the second paragraph, it says the fire department staff recommends recovering additional costs in phases over the course of a four year period. The second sentence is what I wanted to ask about where individual current fees are recovering greater than 100% of the calculated full cost outcome.\nSpeaker 0: These fees are recommended to be reduced to no more than 100% cost recovery. So my question is, which fees are those?\nSpeaker 11: There was a few fees in our overall fees which are attached to this report that actually were probably calculated at a higher rate. In the past, above what our current costs are. So under the state law of cost recovery, we can recover our costs, but only up to what our costs are.\nSpeaker 0: So call off hand.\nSpeaker 11: Which I can't recall offhand. I know there is only just a handful of them, just some small things that, you know are probably fees we hardly ever charge. But to be consistent with state law. Yeah, she measures in mind there's probably like four small ones that were captured in there.\nSpeaker 11: So. Offhand. I apologize. I don't remember what they were, but the majority of our fees did go up significantly with that increase that we proposed because we do have a number of fees in there. If you look at the overall fee index.\nSpeaker 0: I did, but I did always catches my attention when it says that some fees will be reduced. And I'm sure the business you're interested to. And by the way, you were very well received by all you and Deputy Chief John Beck were well received by the business associations because I heard back from them.\nSpeaker 0: And thank you for doing that at my request. Thank you. Another question I have on page four, this has two tables to provide a comparison of the recommended city of Alameda. It it's the second table, the recommended city of Alameda Fire Department fees staff provides the below table of similar communities and their associated fee structures.\nSpeaker 0: I'm still trying to figure out Hayward, but I'll ask one of my friends on the Hayward Council about that another time, Walnut Creek. I kind of get that. But Fremont, can you help me understand why is Fremont's inspection hourly rate $192 in their plan review?\nSpeaker 0: $95? If you know.\nSpeaker 11: As my understanding with Fremont, because they had Fremont went through an incredible growth spurt probably in the last ten years, I think their council made a decision to keep their fees as low as possible. So that reflects in what they're actually charging you as a council.\nSpeaker 11: Set the policy on what you want to collect, what percentage. So the proposals before you without you giving staff direction. I spent a lot of time with our finance director and our city manager. And if you read the NBC study, if we were to do a 100% cost recovery for fire prevention, our average hourly rate would be\nSpeaker 11: $300 an hour. I think that's a little egregious. If we were to inspect a barbershop, a small hair salon, you know, $300, that's a pretty high fee. And if you look at like Hayward of Walnut Creek, they made the decision, no, we're going to recover 100% of our cost.\nSpeaker 11: That's the council direction in those communities. The manager and I felt that and the business community was very supportive of it. If we kind of quantitative the fees at a nominal increase the first year, a nominal increase, the second year kind of a reprieve period, and then another increase to get it up to $200 an hour and\nSpeaker 11: not the 300 we're doing. We're obviously recovering the fire marshal costs totally, but we're also taking away from the general fund its fuller impact instead of the general fund paying 100% of the total cost of fire prevention bureau in the fourth year, they would pay the fees would recover 59%.\nSpeaker 11: So the general fund would be reduced liability down to 41%. We felt that that was a more kind of smoothing, an easy way to implement these fees. We recognize that costs will accelerate and go up in the future and we have those automatic increases in there to deal with those if we need to.\nSpeaker 11: So I think that gives you a little background on Fremont, some of the other cities. It's really the council's decision. Do you want to if you want us to charge $300 an hour as mayor and that's your wish this evening, we'll certainly comply with that.\nSpeaker 11: But I think after speaking with our business community, they were very supportive of how we said thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I don't think I heard myself say that, but I was just questioning if you knew and perhaps you don't. But that's interesting. So that Fremont might have decided not to burden their development community with fees. Then the other question I wanted to ask you is that the top of my page five, which talks about maybe it's um\nSpeaker 0: , somewhere I guess is just a footnote that as far as the billing for these fees that Berkeley city of Berkeley pro rates their fee by the the quarter hour. Is there some thought to doing that for Alameda.\nSpeaker 11: I believe we included in the master fee schedule both a quarter and half hour.\nSpeaker 4: Increments to match that.\nSpeaker 0: And so if you went, say, by four waiting by the quarter hour, but that changed the revenue assumptions that the billing structure is based on. You know, if you're not, any visit that you walk into is going to be minimum of one hour charge, but instead it's decided to be one quarter hour.\nSpeaker 0: Is there don't we have.\nSpeaker 11: To know if you actually look at if you actually look at the master fee schedule, mayor, it'll say we'll give you example, pick a supermarket, it'll say the occupancy type in the square footage. It already has pre-established how long it takes us so that one could be a 2 to 2 and a half hour.\nSpeaker 11: So the hourly rates and the inspection cost would be based on that amount of time. A barbershop very small. The. You only have a few things to look at. Maybe an hour and maybe half an hour. So it gives us flexibility in the actual fee study or the fee lines now to do that.\nSpeaker 11: So but it doesn't impact the overall fee, the fee amounts, if you look in the table of our step stepped cost recovery are extremely conservative. We only looked at revenue in the future from one source that the Fire Prevention Bureau does, and that's mercantile inspections, business inspections.\nSpeaker 11: There will be an incredible amount more of revenue because we also do residential inspections, apartment buildings, anything more than three units. We also do code enforcement and code compliance, which has its own set of revenue sources. And we also do reinspection fees.\nSpeaker 11: I really can't tell you, and I wish that every business didn't need a re-inspection. But as you go through more inspections and some businesses are more problematic than others, the reinspection costs go up considerably, too. So we can kind of quantify and maybe give an estimate to those.\nSpeaker 11: But the numbers you see here are very conservative. So I'm going to I'm going to say to council that we're trying to obviously under-promise and overdeliver.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: I have a question.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Councilmember Desai. Thank you, Chief.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. Now, currently, is it correct that any kind of fire prevention or any kind of services that are being offered that are similar to what what's contemplated under tonight's discussion? Is it correct that we're doing it through non sworn fire personnel?\nSpeaker 11: No. The current staffing in the bureau is three personnel currently. All three are sworn. We do have one civilian inspection person. That's our senior code compliance officer. That's been vacant for some time. That is a non sworn position.\nSpeaker 11: Unfortunately, we're going out for the fourth time to try and recruit a replacement for that. But we it's been vacant for some time and we're having extreme difficulties trying to recruit the civilian position for that.\nSpeaker 10: Is it correct to say that there was a point in time when it was done by non sworn personnel?\nSpeaker 11: No. If you go back to when the bureau was shuttered in 2009, there was a staff of seven there and five of the seven were sworn positions, two were non sworn and it dropped out. Actually the one non sworn position that recently retired that we have to fill and council made a decision back, I believe in May\nSpeaker 11: of 17 to bring a smaller version of the Bureau back and that included the three non three sworn positions that I spoke of earlier.\nSpeaker 10: And do other CIT, do other cities do use non sworn or is the majority use sworn? What's the mix?\nSpeaker 11: It really depends on the city. If I had to take a pulse of comparable agencies, most agencies use sworn primarily for a couple of reasons. Non sworn fire inspectors. The positions generally don't pay very well and there's no chance for promotion.\nSpeaker 11: So they're considered kind of a dead end job. Most people take them to get some experience to go on and to become a firefighter or some other, you know, public safety professional. So we're finding that now with trying to recruit the sworn, the non sworn position that we lost.\nSpeaker 11: So most of my fire chief friends that I talked to are going if they do have non sworn as non sworn leave, they're replacing them with sworn because they just can't get non sworn because we can't maintain a salary that's competitive.\nSpeaker 11: And obviously people know going into it there's no chance for promotion. It's pretty much, I hate to say it, it's pretty much regarded as a dead end job.\nSpeaker 10: And final question, the discussion regarding the extent to which we utilize non sworn versus sworn. Is it correct to say that that was a council discussion that occurred robustly in 2017.\nSpeaker 11: From my from my information on the history of it? Yes. I think there was quite a bit of discussion on sworn versus non sworn and looking at everything. And I think I think options were presented on both.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Questions.\nSpeaker 0: Counselor.\nSpeaker 3: Over.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. Just a question of the city attorney. I mean, that's not an issue that we're allowed to be really discussing today, right? The issue of sworn versus non sworn. It's not on the agenda. It's not in the staff report.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I just want to I don't want to get shut up.\nSpeaker 7: I think you can probably if it relates to the fee study, if it relates to, you know, establishing the amount of the fees, then it would be something that would be appropriate for discussion point made.\nSpeaker 5: So Chief, thanks for that presentation. I just wanted to ask a few questions on the fire marshal position so we don't have that position today, right?\nSpeaker 11: Correct.\nSpeaker 5: So who's who's doing that job?\nSpeaker 11: Primarily myself and what little staff we do have assigned to the Fire Prevention Division currently.\nSpeaker 5: So what things? I mean, you only have limited number of hours in the week, right?\nSpeaker 7: Yes.\nSpeaker 5: So by having you do that and not having a full time fire marshal, I mean, what are we what are we losing? I mean, what are we not getting? What things are going undone?\nSpeaker 11: Well, if you look at the staff report and again, I don't want to hear what page it is because my pages are different. We really talk about the duties of a fire marshal and that's also what's really not getting done there.\nSpeaker 11: Bullet points I should at the bottom of my page three, it may be different than yours. That's really what's not getting done. We don't have the daily management and oversight of that division. It's the only division that doesn't have daily management and oversight in the form of a chief officer.\nSpeaker 11: Every other division does. Prior to 2009, we had a full time fire marshal that was a chief officer. And most communities, with rare exception, have a full time fire marshal, i.e. chief officer assigned. The fire marshal is critical and it's going to be more critical in the very near future.\nSpeaker 11: As this counsel knows, there's an incredible amount of pent up development on the island that's about to occur and we're trying to balance keeping new construction moving and also the existing problems in buildings today. The city manager and I have come up with some contingency plans.\nSpeaker 11: And if the fire marshal position doesn't get approved, well, I'm going to have to step back as fire chief and really make a decision on what we can do moving forward. And something has to give and I have to have a more higher priority with the existing buildings because people are in them.\nSpeaker 11: We have existing life support. Issues. Whereas a building that's being built is no hazard today because it's not being constructed. So it's imperative, you know, to keep our community moving forward. This is a mission critical position, and I probably said that in my report several times.\nSpeaker 11: So hopefully that answers your question, Councilmember.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And by you doing double duty and only getting paid one one for one job, I mean, what duties of yours are are we potentially sacrificing by you continuing to be the fire marshal?\nSpeaker 11: Well, I think my staff would probably say they're hopeful that we get a fire marshal because I have to rely on them more. And there's a lot of things we're not getting done. We have an incredible recruit issue we have to deal with coming up because of our vacancies.\nSpeaker 11: We have succession planning. We have new company officers, new chief officers. I wish I had one on one time for the succession planning and mentoring. I can't find the time. And that's one of the things. And to me, those are incredibly important because we need to build our next future leaders.\nSpeaker 11: Summer in this room today, and that's imperative. And that's my job. But I can't find time to do that. So that does suffer greatly. And it's sad that it does.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. And you mentioned the development. I talked to Andrew Thomas, and I think the number he gave me was between 29, 49 and 30, 49 in the pipeline. I mean, what happens to those if we don't have a robust.\nSpeaker 11: I'm going to have I'm going to have to make some hard decisions that the there's going to be significant delays in getting development off and up and running and construction. No development can proceed without the review of built in fire protection systems.\nSpeaker 11: The the lot plans, access points, fire hydrants on scene, on location, etc. There's a lot of different things that building and fire prevention work hand in hand on to make sure building safe building could be occupied and that without the two working cohesively, things get bogged down.\nSpeaker 11: Things will all slow down considerably.\nSpeaker 5: And this is a chief position, not irf 689 position. Right.\nSpeaker 11: I know this, this position would be part of our chief officer bargaining group.\nSpeaker 5: So not 689. Correct. Okay. And then should I forget the last question? But I think you've answered my questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you, Councilmember.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember.\nSpeaker 10: So just a quick question on the issue of if that there is there's a risk of development projects getting slowed down, but even if development projects get slowed down, is it correct to say that the end result is still an evaluation as to the fire readiness of of whatever project?\nSpeaker 10: So whether you do it under the current proposed scenario or you do it under the what we're doing right now. It's just that one's going to happen faster. But at the end of the day, both are going to have a sign off as to something as to whether a project is fire ready or whatever.\nSpeaker 11: It's not that easy to answer in that fashion. Councilmember de Saag. It really has to do with the project and the time management of existing people. One thing Council has to understand is when we initiated the Fire Prevention Bureau almost two years ago now, all those personnel needed training and significant training to get up to speed, to\nSpeaker 11: be able to do inspections legally, site people legally for code violations, but also to do some basic plan reviews and checks. The overall signing off of a development is really between the office of the Fire Marshal, meaning me now and the building official.\nSpeaker 11: And it really boils down to a time management thing. I'm not here to make an envelope threat of a work stoppage or anything that to the council. I'm just trying to edify for the council that this position is critical.\nSpeaker 11: And we want to support development. We want to support an expanded housing stock for our residents. We obviously want to support more economic development for for us as a community. But we've got to have the people in place and the tools needed for that.\nSpeaker 11: This should have had a fire marshal assigned to it two years ago. Tonight, I'm before you because I was asked to come back from this past July and do two more things. One, do a few study to look at our fees and increase them as needed.\nSpeaker 11: That's before you, but also pay for the position. So tonight I'm coming to you with a fully paid position with no impact to our general fund. And we're getting the benefit of having no future work stoppages and no issues with continuing providing great service that ultimately I believe our community deserves.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any further clarifying questions before we go to our public speakers? Okay. Seeing that I've got two public speakers, the first is Paul Muller and the second is Edward Hirschberg. And you'll each have 3 minutes to speak.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Mueller.\nSpeaker 7: Sorry. Been sitting for a while. A little stiff.\nSpeaker 0: Me too.\nSpeaker 7: No, I know. I feel for you. Mayor Ashcroft. City Council members. Community. I'm an Alameda resident. I mean, Alameda business owner. I am a. Business Transactions attorney with an office over in Mariner Square. My wife shares our office.\nSpeaker 7: She's an educational therapist. She also lives and work there in Alameda in 2007.\nSpeaker 0: And Mr. Mueller, to be sure, you're directing. Oh, I'm.\nSpeaker 7: Sorry. In 2017, a fire inspector came to our 800 square foot office for three offices and a meeting, you know, an entry area. He was very nice, introduced himself, looked around, poked his head into each of our offices, said everything, looked fine and walked out.\nSpeaker 7: He about two weeks later, we then got a bill for his inspection and the bill was $402 a one hour minimum charge. So my request, I find that unacceptable. So whatever the business community meetings have had with the fire chief and I certainly, you know, respect that and understand that for me, $102 charge for what was essentially\nSpeaker 7: a five minute inspection works out to 1200 dollars an hour. I build by the hour, I don't know, 1200 dollars an hour. And I have 40 years experience as an attorney. My wife bills by the hour. She's a well respected educational therapist.\nSpeaker 7: She doesn't bill 1200 dollars an hour. So my request is that if you approve these fees and I certainly don't see any reason why you shouldn't, that you also direct the fire department to bill in some increments. That's less than an hour.\nSpeaker 7: It does not take an hour to review my office. The gentleman was there for 5 minutes max, so actually that's it. My request is, is that if you approve the fees, that you also approve or require a request that the fire department do it in increments of less than a full hour.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. I'm Evan Herzberg.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of City Council. I'd like to discuss the issue we had last year. The fire inspector came through our building over in Oak Street and in the space of an hour, went through ten or more.\nSpeaker 7: Officers building $102 for each and $102 for us for inspecting the building. Coming out to a bit over $1,000 for an hour's worth of work. We had an office building full of angry tenants.\nSpeaker 11: On our hands.\nSpeaker 4: So I made an appointment and I met with the fire chief and he says, Well, this is out of my hands. You need to take it up with the city council. So that's why I'm here tonight.\nSpeaker 7: We don't believe that it's fair to build.\nSpeaker 4: More than one person for the same man hour. If I did it in my.\nSpeaker 7: Business, I'd lose my license and probably be sued for fraud. So I think you need to you need to start building in increments.\nSpeaker 4: Not be building two people at the same time. And when you have an office building, why is it sliced and diced into individual offices for building? Why not simply build look at the entire building as a whole, as one business in two, 3 hours max.\nSpeaker 4: Fire inspector could inspect the entire building and issue a bill for it rather than.\nSpeaker 7: If they go to their current fee schedule.\nSpeaker 4: And their current way of doing it. It's going to cost $10,000 to inspect the building, which is entirely unreasonable. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. We have no further public comments, so we will close public comment. Councilmember Ody.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Madam Mayor. So just a couple of quick comments on this item. You know, I think for people's memories, if they if they don't remember the impetus for this, this was when we had the ghost ship fire over in Oakland and some 30 odd folks died because the place was not inspected.\nSpeaker 5: And even if it would have been inspected, you know, it wasn't it wouldn't have been inspected with people that really have knowledge of, you know, egress and ingress and, you know, all of those things that it's important that that a fire person, you know, has knowledge of.\nSpeaker 5: So last year we had this discussion during the budget and we decided to bring it back. And I think Deputy Deputy Chief Ziemba came back. And then I think you and I had a chicken and egg discussion about, you know, should we do that?\nSpeaker 5: Do we have to do the approval of the position before we approve the cost study? And now we're here today? So I appreciate that you were able to get this done and brought back to us in a timely manner.\nSpeaker 5: You know, I could sit here and discuss about, you know, the benefits of, you know, having a fire marshal versus not having a fire marshal. The the impact on the chief's work life balance. I mean, the impact on the 2900 homes that we are trying to build to meet the housing crisis that could be delayed if we\nSpeaker 5: don't fully fund this position, which, by the way, is really paid for. So I thank you for bringing that that back to us. But I think I want to talk about, you know, basic values and basic values of the city.\nSpeaker 5: And what I see my position here as a city councilmember is to provide basic services to our city. And to me, those services, our police and fire, you know, and to a lesser extent, you know, public works. So while I I don't think that, you know, we should be charging people to provide those basic services because that's\nSpeaker 5: part of our our duty. But be that as it may, I appreciate that our chief has taken out taking a hard look at this and find ways where our our fire department can be more than just a cost center, that it can actually be a revenue generator.\nSpeaker 5: And that $4 million that you found, I mean, that's the equivalent of 80% of our sales tax that we just passed. So I appreciate that and I appreciate the work of our police chief also to try to find grant money to do what I think our core basic services because I don't want to get to a position\nSpeaker 5: where somebody doesn't pick up the phone and call 911 because they think they're going to get billed for, you know, getting robbed or get billed for, you know, their house being on fire. We get billed because the power line is down or bill because a water main broke.\nSpeaker 5: So, I mean, that's my basic philosophy. But, you know, I appreciate that you've done this and we've asked you to do this and find a way to fund this position. I appreciate that. And I really want to commend our safety chiefs for, you know, what they do sometimes.\nSpeaker 5: It's it's disappointing to me that, you know, whenever safety, especially fire, asks for something that improves the safety and protects the lives of our citizens, which is your sworn obligation and you do it well, that is generate so much controversy and it shouldn't, because that is our number one priority as council members.\nSpeaker 5: Our number one priority as the city is to keep our people safe. It's to make sure that people live here, know that they're free from crime, and they know if they get sick and they know that their house is on fire, that we're going to take care of them.\nSpeaker 5: Because if we don't, our. Property values plummet. And then it doesn't really matter about infrastructure, it doesn't really matter about schools, it doesn't really matter about public works because we won't have any of that because we won't have a high property tax base.\nSpeaker 5: So, again, I don't think I think what's lost here is that our chiefs are charged with protecting our citizens and our fire chief. And those that came before him have made us a Class one fire department. I don't know if people understand what that is, but I think we're one of the only, if not the only class\nSpeaker 5: one fire department here in the Bay Area. I think there's maybe 18 statewide and like about 200 now nationwide. So what does that mean for us? I mean, if you look at your bottom line, you know, it means your fire insurance is going to be less.\nSpeaker 5: Everyone loves that. So I think that's a good thing. But what it really means for everyone's day to day lives is that if you pick up the phone and you call 911 and your grandmother is having a stroke, that somebody is going to be there, somebody is going to be there quickly, and they're going to be able\nSpeaker 5: to take care of her and get her to the hospital. If your kid is choking or having a breathing problem that a fireman and a fire woman are going to get there and they're going to take care of your kid.\nSpeaker 5: That's what that means. That means if your husband or wife is sick. That a fireman and a fire woman are going to get there and take care of that person. And those are the things that our firemen and our fire women and our fire chief and our fire management are fighting for every day.\nSpeaker 5: It's not political is to make sure that our people that live here are safe. And that is our number one priority. And as long as I am sitting here, that is going to be my number one priority. I am honored to vote for all of these things.\nSpeaker 5: I think it's a great thing that you're doing, Chief, and I applaud you for finding ways to find more ways to raise money and find ways to pay for these services. But at the bottom line, to me, this is a core service that we need to be providing.\nSpeaker 5: And I applaud you for bringing it forward.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Actually, Councilmember Vela had her hand up a little earlier. She had some, I think, unanswered questions. Councilmember Vella.\nSpeaker 8: So there were a couple questions that got raised by the speakers and and Chief, actually, I don't know if these questions some of them might be for you and some of them might be for our city manager or our interim city manager, but for building and our building and planning department.\nSpeaker 8: Do you know what increments we build for them? Do we?\nSpeaker 4: I'm sorry. I do not. As the chief said in this study, they are broken down into quarter and half hour and one hour increments. But sometimes on these types of inspections, I should leave that to the chief. And it's customary here.\nSpeaker 4: Is that a a building or an office is charged, an individual inspection, if it has an individual business license. So you may have an office building that has a dozen offices in it, and each one of those would be filled individually.\nSpeaker 4: The firefighter or the code enforcement officer comes there and then they have to go back and they've got to do paperwork. So it's just not time on scene. It's time completing the necessary documents and then the filing and the clerk portion of it and the bookkeeping portion of it.\nSpeaker 8: But that's so so to clarify, Chief, there might be the individual face time of the inspection itself, and then there's additional there's additional paperwork on the back end and ahead of time in terms of scheduling or how does that work?\nSpeaker 11: Correct. When NBC met with our staff, we looked at every possible occupancy that would need to be inspected. How much time it takes. Looking at travel time, preparation, reading the code, doing a reference check on the business, the history of that business.\nSpeaker 11: As Mr. Reid had alluded to, there's also travel time back. There's an incredible amount of paperwork to make sure they're safe. There's a we now that we bill, we have those building costs built in. We have clerical support, there's vehicles, radios, etc., etc., all go in and to make it up that cost to the two speakers that\nSpeaker 11: I haven't talked to personally but have dealt with on correspondence. We do now have the mechanism before you for small businesses to look at a half hour raid or if we're there for an hour and a quarter, we can do that.\nSpeaker 11: Whereas the passed fee schedule, we did not have that option. So that's one thing that we did built in because, you know, we want to be cognizant of our community and we want to be fair and certainly provide a good service, but a service that's meaningful and meant and obviously responsible.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. And then my second question, Chief, is and this was briefly touched upon, but for for an individual building. So that would be if there's different sub tenants or different sub businesses or business license holders within a singular building, they would each have to have their own inspection.\nSpeaker 11: Correct. It really depends on not so much their business license, but the type of occupancy that they are. Every business is expectable under the fire code. Some are mandated, some aren't. So we really try and do the ones that have the most risk to a life first and then kind of work backwards from there.\nSpeaker 8: How often are they inspected?\nSpeaker 11: It really depends. We're trying to get to an annual inspection rotation, but with limited staff it's been difficult. I don't know the exact amounts, but you know, the ones that are state mandated, like a care facility for the elderly, those type of things, we do those annually, but the rest we have to really just kind of stagger\nSpeaker 11: based on the personnel needs that we have assigned.\nSpeaker 8: So like a law office or an office for an insurance company or somebody who sells insurance or something like that, they they wouldn't have an annual inspection requirement.\nSpeaker 11: They would under the code. It's really up to us to we have that time management capacity to do that. Okay. So and it's a yes and no answer. I wish I had more info for you, but.\nSpeaker 1: No, it's helpful.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: And I did so since this also is council discussion. Thank you, chief. Those questions and I and I do appreciate the thorough report and especially the follow up. I know we had a lot of questions in our work session that we had and it required a lot of work.\nSpeaker 8: So I appreciate that. I do work in my day job in the city of Fremont. And there was a question raised earlier about Fremont, and they actually just published their fiscal year 2018, 2019, proposed operating budget and budget updates.\nSpeaker 8: And I have already reviewed them because I have to go there for a meeting next week. But so for the city of Fremont, they do a little a couple of things a little differently. First of all, they have they maintain a general fund primary reserve of 15%.\nSpeaker 8: And when you count the budget uncertainty reserve, it goes to 16.8%. It's significantly different from how we try to keep our general fund, and I want to keep it that way. And the other thing is, is that they have significant so they're a population of about a quarter million and they have significant revenue sources from property tax\nSpeaker 8: , about $92 million. This past fiscal year, it's projected to go up another 6 to 7% to about 97.5 million. And then sales tax, which they're on track for, and sales tax is about 51 million. A year and it's projected actually to go up to 7.1% and that's on track to about 55 million.\nSpeaker 8: I think the question for me is, you know, and really the question before the council is how much do we want to subsidize these fees? And we've been heavily subsidizing them essentially by not really charging the the kind of the actual for the for the actual time involved.\nSpeaker 8: And that has meant that we don't have the personnel involved. And Councilmember Odie alluded to this whole chicken and the egg conversation, and we spent a lot of time at the work session kind of figuring out why can't we charge the fees and then fill the position?\nSpeaker 8: And part of it is the state of California says you can't just charge the fees without actually having the position and filling it. So you have to you have to create the position in order to charge the fees.\nSpeaker 8: And then you actually have to work at filling the position and making sure that we're actually out doing that work. And I guess the question is, how much do we want to subsidize this? I think there is no doubt in my mind that we have to get this work done.\nSpeaker 8: It's part of helping Alameda kind of continue to move forward with some of these things that we have lined up. And I certainly don't want to change how we go about. I think the failure has been that we've said we are going to subsidize it and then we actually don't plan for the position and then the work\nSpeaker 8: doesn't get done. So I don't think that that system has actually worked for us. And I think if we actually did start subsidizing it with general fund money, then where does the money come from? And I want to continue to be, you know, doing what we're doing to do these set asides with our general fund.\nSpeaker 8: So I do think that really for me, the compromise is this kind of fee structure that's gradual and that is, you know, looking at increments of time that are smaller than what's existed, which is what one of the speaker's concerns were.\nSpeaker 8: We're not trying to overbuild. We're not trying to price gouge, but we are trying to cover costs. And I think that that's the responsible thing to do. And we do this occasionally where we have to adjust our fees.\nSpeaker 8: We did it last year with the parks. So so, you know, in light of that, I'm happy to hear from my colleagues. But for those reasons, I'm supportive of making sure that we create these positions and get the work done and and actually collect the fees for the work that we're doing, which we have not been doing\nSpeaker 0: . Thank you. And councilmember members like you had your hand up.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. I believe that the role of the city council is to provide basic services in a cost effective manner. And I think the reason why we are striving to increase fees in an effort to recover costs is because the underlying workforce that's delivering this service, it's the cost is quite high.\nSpeaker 10: But the reality, though, is that unfortunately, the conversation about whether or not to have non sworn persons do the fire prevention type of building inspection type of activities, that conversation between having non sworn or sworn is a conversation that happened in 2017 and as a result the fire chief is following through on the directions there.\nSpeaker 10: So he cannot be he or his staff cannot be deemed for that. But I did run in 2018 looking to non sworn to provide the fire prevention services, the building inspections. And and so that was a point that I had raised with the public in the run up to November 2018.\nSpeaker 10: And I recognize that, you know, that that we are not going to revisit that. But that's also a truth that, you know, I had conveyed a perspective that I had conveyed to the public. And so I will be hard pressed to support this.\nSpeaker 10: I also recognize though that if we go with the non sworn civilian, had we had we done that. I also recognize that there might be some downsides and the downsides might be, you know, for example, delayed in development.\nSpeaker 10: But at the end of the day and that was the question I was getting at the end of the day, whosoever provides the service, we have to believe that at the end of the day, whether it takes, you know, three weeks to complete tasks or whether it takes six weeks to complete tasks, at the end of the\nSpeaker 10: time that the service that will have been rendered is an evaluation as to whether or not a business or a property that's being developed is fire, preventive, safe? So from my perspective, I'm willing to go with that tradeoff of having delayed development with non sworn.\nSpeaker 10: But I recognize though that that was a conversation that really happened in 2017.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I'm going to go next. Thank you. And also, I did note to the clerk that I thought I was having time saved after clerk every time I called on speakers. And that is not the intent. So stop doing that.\nSpeaker 0: Please give me a little extra time, but I'll try to talk fast. Thank you, Chief Rodriguez. Good, thorough report. And and also Deputy Chief is on back who was kind enough to meet with me last week and answer my Brazilian questions on this particular item.\nSpeaker 0: I asked the interim city manager, Mr. Ruda, not to bring the authorization for the $355,000 fire marshal position and the $70,000 vehicle request to the Council. At this particular point in time, I explained that we are two months away from budget hearings and we also have a new city manager coming in about six weeks.\nSpeaker 0: But every other department in this city is currently preparing their requests for increased staffing expenditures and so forth. For the budget process, it is more prudent to consider all budget requests at the same time to give the Council and also the public a more realistic view of city finances.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Rouda told me that to not fill this position now would delay development projects and construction of new residential housing. So I'm always one who likes to do my homework. I reached out to Andrew Thomas, our planning director, and Greg McFadden, our city building official, and asked them, Have you run into delays in our our development?\nSpeaker 0: New development, new residential. And they both looked at me and said, what? No. And Mr. McFadden even checked with all his business building inspectors. And that isn't happening. I mean, I love hearing the number of 2949 housing units in the pipeline.\nSpeaker 0: We should be so lucky to see these in the next decade. I mean, we just broke ground yesterday on the first residential development at Alameda Point. It's 66 oh, senior affordable apartments. That's wonderful. My point is, in California, for many reasons, residential development, commercial development is just not happening fast and furiously.\nSpeaker 0: I do have concerns that this funding, funding this position with inspection fees, fee increases and other fees is a risky proposition, given that we have to anticipate an economic downturn sometime in our future, which could result in businesses closing or leaving Alameda and therefore reducing the amount of inspection fee revenue.\nSpeaker 0: And indeed, the last time there was a Fire Protection Bureau and it got closed down, it was in during the downturn in the economy 2008, 2009. We also know, and it's my duty as an elected official to deal with this we have a growing pension and OPEB liability that we must address because I want all of you\nSpeaker 0: folks in the front rows to have your pensions in your retirement because you have earned them. You have worked hard, you have risked your lives. But I can't do that if this city doesn't stay solvent. And we don't have to look too far from Alameda to see examples where cities went bankrupt and the obligations to the retirees\nSpeaker 0: could not be met. I take that extremely seriously. We have also identified more than $300 million in infrastructure needs in our city, and that was a year ago when we were looking at but.\nSpeaker 3: Didn't.\nSpeaker 0: Manage to put an infrastructure bond on the the ballot to take to the voters. And I would just add that it didn't include a swimming pool at that time. And so those needs still exist with no funding source, better general fund to pay for them.\nSpeaker 0: We need to keep that in mind. Of course, I want our city to be safe for those who live, work and play here. And in 2017, shortly after the tragic ghost ship fire in Oakland, at my request, I met with then fire chief Doug Long.\nSpeaker 0: I wanted to know how many uninspected buildings do we have in my city? And he gave me a printout of over 3000 commercial buildings that were overdue for annual fire inspections, some going back as long as 25. Based on that information and his insistence that only sworn firefighters could adequately staff this bureau, I voted for those sworn\nSpeaker 0: positions. Later, I learned that many other fire departments in Oakland is one of them staff their fire protection bureaus with civilian personnel, but at the head they use sworn personnel. Chief Rodriguez was unable at short notice to provide me with an updated version of this inspection list.\nSpeaker 0: But I would like to know what has the Fire Protection Bureau accomplished in the comparison of when I saw the list in 2017 until now, with the sworn positions that we did at Metrics are important. Recently, this Council voted to approve funding from the General Fund for the Community Peer Medicine Program.\nSpeaker 0: It was to be a one third, one third, one third split with Alameda County Emergency Services, Alameda Hospital and the city. But last week, when I met with the chief operating officer of the county health systems and said, So when can we expect our money?\nSpeaker 0: He said, No, we turned down that request. We didn't see that it was that much of a cost savings to the hospital. So right now the city is burying two thirds instead of one third of the cost, a little over $200,000.\nSpeaker 0: Anyway, to wrap up, it is crucial for the Council to consider actions that further burden our general fund very carefully and logically. I reiterate my request that the approval of this Fire Marshal position for an annual cost of $355,000 and the purchase of a vehicle for $70,000 be considered during the upcoming budget workshops rather than this evening\nSpeaker 0: . I am fully supportive of the fee increase and I would say we don't have to create the positions to justify the fee increases. We have to show the nexus to the activity. And I think the chief and the folks who put the report together did a very good job.\nSpeaker 0: But I think as a council, we have a greater responsibility to look out for the the good of the entire city, which is made up of many valuable departments. Thank you OC Vice Mayor, we haven't heard from you.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. So I'd like to thank. Chief Rodriguez, budget director there, and the city manager for spending a lot of time talking to me, asking, answering a lot of questions. I am thankful and supportive of the fee structure that that has been a lot of feedback here that's been proposed tonight.\nSpeaker 9: I do have one issue that I would like to address as we as we approve this. And it's that when you look at.\nSpeaker 3: Florida and you don't think you're fine.\nSpeaker 0: Just don't get points because maybe. They'll turn you down. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 4: Sorry. We're good. Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker 9: When you look at the cost recovery chart, it assumes that there's no increase in the actual expenditures of this program over the four years, despite the fact that we know the contracts are going to are going to increase cost of living increases every single year.\nSpeaker 9: And so in approving this, I'm going to ask that we approved this in $2,018 with an expectation that every year this fee is increased, according to the COLA for the state, for the staff covered by the memo use that provide these services.\nSpeaker 9: In that way we will make sure that the that the 59% actually is covering the costs that in 2019 it is covering. If you actually adjust and look at it, it actually, under the current proposal would actually have a general general fund impact.\nSpeaker 9: When I spoke to Chief Long Chief Rodriguez in January about the fact that this issue would be coming forward, because I had heard it discussed at the workshop last spring and again during the budget, and as has been mentioned by many people, a number of people beginning in 2017, I did ask the question about why is this\nSpeaker 9: coming ahead of the budget? And the response was, since it doesn't, since it will have a net zero impact on the general fund, it would be and it had been asked for for two years that they would like to move it forward.\nSpeaker 9: And I told him at that point in time that as long as they could bring forward something that provided a needed service, that had a net zero impact on the general fund, that I would be open to supporting it.\nSpeaker 9: So tonight, I think if we can if we can approve the approve the cost recovery fee schedule, which includes the cost for this position, along with the position which I would like to condition, will be cost neutral over its lifetime.\nSpeaker 9: So as this goes forward, if the costs go up for this position, we will need to make sure that it is recovering those costs. This costs, this disposition as it has happened in 2008 and other times can be removed if necessary if we are in budget issues.\nSpeaker 9: But I would like would like to see it as a cost neutral because we are proposing it outside of the budget. If at some point in time we want to put it into the budget and have it be a budgeted general fund costs, I am open to that, but that should be done during the budget.\nSpeaker 9: Additionally, I would like to have a report, a six month report on the both the billing and collection of fees. In speaking to the Chief, it is my understanding that the $499,000 in fees that we are estimating in revenues is not the amount we're billing, it's the amount we're collecting, and that there is a lot of billing\nSpeaker 9: that is happening out there that is not being collected right now. I will hope that the Council will be working with our city manager to identify how we can also increase the collection of these fees to make sure that we are indeed having this be a conservative budget request.\nSpeaker 9: As the last speaker, I would be more than happy to make that into a motion.\nSpeaker 0: If we have another councilmember de SAC has something else to say.\nSpeaker 7: A question. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: I get that off the table first. Councilmember de Desai.\nSpeaker 10: The question towards legal staff. Would the use of a CPI factor to increase the NOM in nominal sense to increase the rate, recognizing that in real inflation adjusted terms it doesn't. Recognizing that. Would that trigger a need for a whole new Nexus study?\nSpeaker 10: Or is there some kind of language that says that that because the next study is predicated on the course of today.\nSpeaker 9: So I did I did ask that question. And just to quickly address addressed it, since we are not claiming 100% of the fees, that that increase would still keep us within the costs that are very I mean, it's like a $12 a year increase.\nSpeaker 9: It would keep us well within the costs that have already been identified in this study.\nSpeaker 11: Maybe if I could address a couple of questions, I might have a little bit more information than our city attorney.\nSpeaker 7: You know, I'll just say next.\nSpeaker 0: Let's start with this issue and then your next she wrote.\nSpeaker 7: I will just say that the Nexus study in terms of its legal validity, it's the assumptions are based upon what's before the council tonight it's not going to trigger a new Nexus study so long as we are as the chief has already said, we're not meeting our cost of service.\nSpeaker 7: So the council could direct staff to come back or could direct staff to if the council chose to adopt this matter. The Council could include a provision in the fee schedule that would require that the fees. Increase based upon the cost of living increases in the.\nSpeaker 0: Chief Harris.\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. Mayor, if I could just answer, probably Councilmember De Saag and Vice Mayor Knox White's question. If you look at resolution number one, 2191, the very last, whereas in that is currently allowing the council to further increase these fees annually by the consumer and or construct excuse me, construction price indices.\nSpeaker 11: So we already have that factor built in. But if you wanted to modify it to match a more you percentage, we can certainly do that too. There are nominal increases built in already which you know, will still keep us with higher amounts as the years go by.\nSpeaker 11: But we've already included that in here for your consideration tonight. So I'll leave it up to you with accounts discretion. But I believe that should answer the majority of what you're speaking of.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Did that answer your question, Mr. De sir?\nSpeaker 10: I think, one I just want to put on record. My worry is that recognizing that, you know, it's in the resolution and everything is all one thing. You know, us doing internal analytics, you know, it's to say that it passes analytic and legal muster.\nSpeaker 10: It's all good within City Hall. But I wonder if we're making ourselves vulnerable to a lawsuit by someone who might say, wait, wait, wait, if you're going to even if you're going to increase it by a CPI factor, and even if that, you know, the rate is under whatever threshold it is now, could someone say, hey, you\nSpeaker 10: need a whole new study? Every time you change it, change the number. I don't know. That's all I'm saying. Okay.\nSpeaker 9: So I hear the I hear the concern and I think we can.\nSpeaker 0: Do this Mary Knox way.\nSpeaker 9: I think we can just we can direct the staff to just increase the costs that are currently here by 3% each year, assuming a 3% CPI, assuming that that's going to be the highest that any of the COLAs that are that that the staff is going to get.\nSpeaker 9: It's well within the next study. So if the concern is in the future, we might increase it and get trapped. Get get caught by somebody saying, oh, you didn't do a new study before raising the fee. Then we can just direct staff to include a specific cost today that is well within the cost identified in the fee\nSpeaker 0: . Okay. Councilmember, will you want to comment or ask a question?\nSpeaker 8: I'm just looking at the city attorney here. Can you. The answer that.\nSpeaker 7: I. The problem. Okay. First of all, you know, to try and opine on whether or not we're going to be exposed to litigation every time the staff comes forward with the next study that that's that's a little difficult.\nSpeaker 7: You're always exposed to litigation. Every time you adopt a next study, I think we'd have to hear from NBC in terms of what the underlying assumptions are in the Nexis study. I've I've reviewed the Nexus study. I didn't see anything specifically that talked about personnel costs.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, I'd have to I'd have to look there. There is. Let me invite my my colleague as well, Lisa maxwell, who's got some more familiarity with the Nexus study, too.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Would you please wait until you're at the microphone, Ms.. Maxwell. And whoever is speaking, introduce yourself. Please use the microphone.\nSpeaker 3: Who would you like to speak?\nSpeaker 7: All right. The point I'm trying to get to and I'll. I'll I can ask, please, is, is the Nexus study establishes the fees, but I don't know what the underlying assumptions are because. You know, we didn't review the backup documentation, but I think that that the vice mayor's proposal would not trigger a a new Nexus study.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So did we have a question for the maker of the study?\nSpeaker 3: Well, the only comment I would give you.\nSpeaker 0: Guys could introduce yourself.\nSpeaker 3: Please. Nicole Casey, I'm from NBC and I helped with the study. The only comment I would provide you guys is that CPI or Labor cost increase in between study years, which is every 3 to 5 years, would be a very common industry standard.\nSpeaker 3: It all comes back to the language in the Constitution and other government codes that we are working with the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service.\nSpeaker 10: Councilmember DE So I can just ask questions. Is the proposal that Vice Mayor Knox White is raising, is that. Something that happens all the time across the cities that you work with.\nSpeaker 3: So I believe you mentioned COLA in between years, which is different than CPI. That has to do more with labor cost increase or analyzed in the budget to see what that is for Alameda. And that is one very common methodology of it.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So did you have a question?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. I'm sorry. Through the.\nSpeaker 0: Church and through the chair.\nSpeaker 5: To the vice mayor. So is your proposal to increase it with COLA, increase it with CPI, increase it with the contract?\nSpeaker 9: I would I would say based based on that. Based on the contract, because we actually may change contracts in the middle tier. We would use the COLA that is provided in this state. It's almost entirely staff cost. So I reduce the staff costs, increase annual staff cost, increases the the metric because I think that would capture them\nSpeaker 5: . And I imagine that if for some reason legal staff analyze this and says that was something we couldn't do, you could come back to us and we could amend a resolution or something.\nSpeaker 7: That's correct.\nSpeaker 0: All right. I'm sorry, Mr. Mueller, but I've closed public comment. Okay. We have three resolutions to vote on. So the first one is the. Resolution number 1 to 1 nine one, amending the resolution, amending M.P. resolution number 1 to 1 nine one and revised fees.\nSpeaker 0: Does someone want to make a motion on that?\nSpeaker 9: I would like to I would like to move approval of that ordinance with the language that includes an annual call up. Sorry. It's just staff.\nSpeaker 0: Actually. Why don't we hold on for just a minute while we have a little say? But now I would rather have you be. Yeah, let's. Okay. We're going to take a five minute break, everyone. Yeah, you got 5 minutes.\nSpeaker 3: Wait. Now you need brownies.\nSpeaker 10: They just remembered.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yes, we. We're back. Okay. Vice Mayor, next week you have the floor.\nSpeaker 9: So at the at the direction or with input from this, the city attorney, the budget director and the city manager, there are some issues, including that language. So we're going to approve the ordinance as written with direction to staff that when you bring back the master fee schedule each year, we should make sure that we have increased\nSpeaker 9: the fees that are in this schedule. We are approving by the court, by, by COLA or, you know, whatever is the appropriate, whatever it.\nSpeaker 0: Doesn't say COLA, but it does say the consumer and or construction price.\nSpeaker 9: Indices, right? That's right. Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So we have it. We have a motion.\nSpeaker 9: So I want to. I almost forgot something, and I want to increase I want to include ensure that we are also billing in incremental. Time increments, not hours as as was.\nSpeaker 11: So that's included in the master.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. Just want to make sure. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So we have a motion to have a second.\nSpeaker 3: Second.\nSpeaker 0: All in favor. I opposed. Okay. When oppose the motion carries 4 to 1.\nSpeaker 3: And Mayor?\nSpeaker 0: Yes?\nSpeaker 5: I'd like to move. Adoption of the resolution approving workforce changes to add one division chief position to the fire department. Fire Prevention Services Division effective three 619 for an annual cost of 355. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: I have a motion to have a second, second and discussion. There is a 70,000 vehicle expenditure and there is that next item.\nSpeaker 3: Item.\nSpeaker 0: That's the next. I'm sorry. That is the modification. Okay. We have a motion in a second on favor. I opposed. No. Okay. The motion passes. 3 to 2. Okay. Now we move on to the third resolution. Who wants to take that?\nSpeaker 0: So we there is a there's a residual.\nSpeaker 5: I will if no one else does.\nSpeaker 0: All right.\nSpeaker 5: Move approval of the third resolution. Do I have to read it or do you got it?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I think we've got that. Yeah. All right. Is there a second? Second all in favor?\nSpeaker 8: I, i.\nSpeaker 0: Opposed. No. Right. The motion carries 3 to 2. Okay. And I think, Madam Vice Mayor. Nuts. Wait.\nSpeaker 9: I would like us to give direction to bring back on a six month basis a an off agenda billing and collection fees report for these new fees so that we can actually monitor that we're collecting the fees that we say that we in the amounts that we are saying that we will.\nSpeaker 0: And you want this to be.\nSpeaker 9: If I don't know what the will of this board is, is to actually vote to give direction on that. Right.\nSpeaker 0: Or you think we have to vote? I think we give staff direction. But I'm trying to get clarity on what the direction is.\nSpeaker 9: To bring to bring it to provide an off agenda report on the collection sorry, the billing and collection of all these fees on a six month basis to the Council.\nSpeaker 8: Councilmember Vela So on a six month basis, for how long?\nSpeaker 9: I would say until we decide we don't need it anymore. I'd like to say we haven't. We have a four year roll out. I'd like to see it over the next year.\nSpeaker 8: Is it possible at some point to sync it up with when we're doing mid-year? I mean, I, I think I guess my question is, in the first year, I can understand since we're starting it kind of close to the mid budget cycle, is there any way we can, we can coordinate some of these meetings with some of\nSpeaker 8: the other report backs that we're getting?\nSpeaker 0: And I want to interrupt. The question is, did we lose Elaina Adair? Did we send her home? She did okay, because I was going to she's the finance director and has to. That's okay. We she has a long commute.\nSpeaker 0: Um, I well, I okay. So I'm hearing of some concern on the part of Councilmember Village. You want to.\nSpeaker 8: I hear, I hear what the vice mayor is saying and I'm supportive of what he's proposing. I don't have a problem with it. I just I think maybe if we can coordinate it with the scheduling of other things, then we can actually get the report back when we're actually collecting all of that data at some point.\nSpeaker 8: So rather than doing it every six months, if we can in the first year, I can understand it being a little different from.\nSpeaker 0: What if I think I'm supportive of the vice mayor because we are staking a lot on this. This is paying a position set to not impact the general fund. What if six month intervals for the first year and then after that to sync it up.\nSpeaker 3: With other.\nSpeaker 0: Fee reporting?\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, that's what I'm proposing.\nSpeaker 11: Understood. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Well, I will communicate that to the finance director, but the clerk, I'm sure.\nSpeaker 1: Has got it in them and.\nSpeaker 0: Is brilliant and got that all.\nSpeaker 7: You're actually just directing.\nSpeaker 0: I Interim City Manager Mr. Reid.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. You're actually directing the interim city manager, too.\nSpeaker 3: Right? She's back. Sorry.\nSpeaker 0: That's okay. I'm sorry. We're. Yes.\nSpeaker 7: You're actually directing the interim city manager to request the.\nSpeaker 3: Right from the financial a.\nSpeaker 7: Report. Right back in six months on collection of the.\nSpeaker 0: Right.\nSpeaker 9: Budget up agenda opportunities to be. I've got a report that they sent to us it does not have to be a presentation. That was my direct.\nSpeaker 4: Got it. We'll take those minutes and formulate it and get passed on to the finance director as well as to Eric Leavitt, your new city manager.\nSpeaker 9: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Any further, folks? All right. With that, we will close. Item 60. Thanks, everyone. Okay, moving on. You know, my goal is to get us out on the same day that we started. City Manager Communications. Mr. Ruda.\nSpeaker 4: No, I'm good tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I know no city manager, communications or communications. Not agenda. Public comment. We have one. We have one. And that is Joe La Parra. Mr. La Parra. Come on at.\n",

Recommendation to Request City Attorney to prepare an ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code just cause for termination of tenancies to include the modifications included an option to an adopt an ordinance to extend the prohibition on termination of certain lawful residential tenancies through February 28, 2022.\nSpeaker 0: Declaring the urgency thereof and declaring that the ordinance shall take effect immediately citywide. There are two votes required for this item.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. City staff.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Members of the council, we do have a fairly detailed staff report. This is a complex topic. We've done a lot of outreach and there's been a lot of discussions over the past year or so.\nSpeaker 3: But to turn it over to our team, to help walk you through the work that's been done, some of the background on the issues as well as three various options and a staff recommendation for your consideration. So I would turn to Oscar Dorsey, our Director Development Services.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mayor, and members of the City Council in in 2018. Give me 1/2. In 2018, tenants and owners representing representatives join the city staff for a series of meetings to discuss potential tenant protection policies and to address the rising rents and tenant displacements.\nSpeaker 9: In March of 20 in the city and staff prepared a presentation that addressed several items related to this ongoing issue in the city. In March ten. On March 10th, 2020, the City Council adopted a just cause for termination tenancy ordinance to take further action regarding these protections.\nSpeaker 9: Our staff is available here and we'll be providing a brief presentation with additional information.\nSpeaker 6: Okay, Counsel, I'm going to walk you through some slides. Thank you for the background, Oscar.\nSpeaker 9: So what we're talking about today.\nSpeaker 6: Is not all of expense, but a specific sub category of evictions related to what's called substantial remodel. And this is not an area unique to the city. This flows out of state law. But the city has the ability to take further action on these categories of landlord tenant relations.\nSpeaker 6: So back in.\nSpeaker 9: July of this year.\nSpeaker 6: A council directed us to draft a moratorium, which we are.\nSpeaker 9: Under at this time, and it prohibits just cause.\nSpeaker 6: Evictions related to substantial remodel. And there's other provisions of state law and for a period of time, county provisions that also restricted such evictions. The city council, our staff, during the time of that moratorium to evaluate the feasibility and cost of different programs, one being known as the renovation administration program, which you see in cities that have\nSpeaker 6: rent control, such as Santa monica and Los Angeles, and other programs which are described as options two and three. And her staff report that we're going to talk about in just a moment. But first, we're going to start with what is a renovation administration program.\nSpeaker 2: And Patrick is going to walk you through that.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Christopher. So what is a renovation administration program? The city of Los Angeles has implemented such a program and it's referred to as a tenant habitability program or THP. This program requires extensive city staff involvement and oversight of rental residential remodel projects, including mitigation of construction impacts to tenants noticing requirements on the submission of an extensive\nSpeaker 6: plan. I'm sorry. I'm noticing again. Noticing the tenants. US property inspections. I'm sorry. I can't read this. Wrong glasses. I'm sorry, everyone. So this is a cumbersome and lengthy process that may deter landlords from making needed repairs. We found that only cities with rent control programs administer thp.\nSpeaker 6: And a THP is linked to those rent control programs and it helps to rent vacancy control at those rent controlled events. We had three stakeholder engagement meetings in August and September. These are some of the stakeholder comments from the tenant stakeholder meeting held on August 25th.\nSpeaker 6: These are some from August 26. This is the property owners stakeholder comments. Property owners were concerned about a lack of data. And they wanted to see substantial more and more clearly defined. The third meeting included both groups and comments were similar.\nSpeaker 6: We did have 26 attendees comment on their experience with displacement. We also had a survey and there were 87 responses to that survey. And this slide provides some of the key ideas and comments from the survey. As with the stakeholder meetings, there were 13 points of view expressed in the survey results.\nSpeaker 6: So there's not a lot of data on this subject. The city is not involved in the eviction process, and so we have no real data on evictions. Calmatters reports that 221 evictions were held since they were completed since May 2020.\nSpeaker 6: But there are no details available on the circumstances of those evictions. We do show that there's 879 permits that appear eligible for substantial remodels between March 2020 March 2021. And that number is similar to 2018 and 19. But that data does not clearly show that there's a tie to evictions and substantial remodels.\nSpeaker 6: When considering changes to the ordinance, it's important to know that renovation work is still necessary and important. 82% of our housing units were built before 1980 and major housing renovations are necessary. Your 30 and more so you're 50 and beyond.\nSpeaker 6: A THP is estimated to cost approximately $2 million to address these 879 potential applicants on an annual basis. And although there might be an opportunity to pass those costs along to property owners, which eventually will trickle down to tenants as rent increases, we feel that there's probably going to be a two year period and a cost of\nSpeaker 6: about $4 million for the project to get started. So we've we've got three options for the city council to consider tonight. The first option is to create a tenant habitability program. And option two is kind of a menu of potential modifications to the Jessica's ordinance.\nSpeaker 6: And that includes revise the definition to require time to vacate 60 days instead of 30 days. Revise the definition and more clearly define what work is qualified as substantial remodel. Establish a civil fine of up to $15,000, payable by landlords to tenants.\nSpeaker 6: When a court has found a manner to have violated just the just cause ordinance. And the final two are revised. The ordinance to require owners to notify the city when people are being evicted due to this provision of the ordinance.\nSpeaker 6: And finally revised the ordinance to require a 30 day notice to vacate. I'm sorry, a 90 day notice to vacate instead of the current 30 and 60. And then finally, option three would be to increase the permanent relocation benefits to 40 $500 per household instead of the current one month's rent that's in the ordinance.\nSpeaker 6: And this option could be considered by itself or it could be combined with the menu of items. An option to. So again, we're here with the recommendation to modify the ordinance to include the provisions contained in option two.\nSpeaker 6: And then we're also asking that you adopt an ordinance amending the Chapter 8.1 or two to extend the prohibition on termination of tenancies due to this provision. That concludes my presentation. Thank you. Thank you. At this point, we'll go to public comment.\nSpeaker 6: We have 35 speakers in queue. So the rules say we go to 90 seconds and so I'll call up the first. I'm going to list the first ten. We have Reverend Sandy Richards, Paul Evans, Corliss Lee, John, alias Elaine Hutcherson, George Bustamante, Alexandra Connor Raya, John Edmund, Matthew Buck and Mike Murchison.\nSpeaker 6: So if you could come up, if you heard your name, call for the line up so we can process, you know, go through this process expeditiously. So first up is Reverend Sandy Richards.\nSpeaker 0: I guess we leave our mask on, right? Yes. Good evening, Vice Mayor and city council members. I'm Reverend Sandy Richards, and I'm the lead pastor of the Southwest United Methodist Church in Long Beach, located in District five and a part of Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice.\nSpeaker 0: I'm here tonight to speak in support of option one. As a pastor, I have seen testimonies of community members impacted by the substantial remodel evictions. Most of them are people of color and the elderly who are already very vulnerable and often do not have the resources to hire lawyers and fight for their rights.\nSpeaker 0: Option one is also important because of the oversight needed. Options two and three placed this burden on our current staffers, increasing their workload and potentially making oversight delayed or ineffective. As the text of the staff report reads, there is currently no existing staff infrastructure for intervention between landlords and tenants, as currently exists in the cities with rent\nSpeaker 0: stabilization in place. Long Beach has been making efforts to address structural racism and ensure equity in our community. We need a fair process that can hold landlords accountable for their repairs and protect tenants from unjust evictions and homelessness.\nSpeaker 0: The policy we vote for tonight has implications for today and generations to come. Leviticus 1918 tells us to love our neighbors as ourselves, which means to look after their wellbeing. I urge you to take bold leadership and vote option one and create a fair process.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Paul Evans and Corliss Lee and then John Elise. Paul.\nSpeaker 0: I didn't come down here.\nSpeaker 6: Just a moment, Paul. Okay. Paul's not here. Next call this lead, then John Elise and then Elaine Hutchison. Oh, you are here where you're up. Go ahead. You can you can swap in sign. Whoever wants to go next is great.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thanks. Okay? Yeah. The prohibition on evictions should not be extended. Let's let it sunset. It harms all involved. A major expression, a major problem expressed by both tenants and landlords is a lack of housing. The best way to solve this is to let the free market work.\nSpeaker 2: Government intervention has contributed to the problem. Do nothing. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Lee then John and then John. Alias, then Elaine Hutchison. Callers.\nSpeaker 2: I think it was John Eilers, wasn't it?\nSpeaker 6: It's Corliss Lee is up now. Well, Corliss Lee, your next John. You're right. You're after Corliss.\nSpeaker 0: After me.\nSpeaker 6: After you.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Excuse me.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Corliss High carelessly here. I'm not a landlord, but I've watched repeated agenda items that treat landlords unfairly. There seems to be an assumption that landlords have deep pockets and confirmed council decisions that favor tenants. Funding a new department designed to evaluate and control actions that would improve properties and require a tenant to vacate during the process.\nSpeaker 0: Seems to me to be city business and the city should pay for it. I was told today that in the year 2000, we had about 2000 personnel in the city and that today we have 6000. I think we.\nSpeaker 5: Have the people to deal with this.\nSpeaker 0: The city has deep pockets, a port, a convention center, an airport, property taxes, and the city should be funding their own bright ideas. Time and again, I hear council decisions that are a hardship for the small landlord. Is your goal to turn rental properties into a corporate business?\nSpeaker 0: Because if we lose the small business landlords, that's where we're going.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, John.\nSpeaker 2: You are up. Thank you. My name is John Ayers. I feel like a gadfly sucking time up. However. I'm speaking against establishing a new department or court to implement the requirements that are spelled out in item 36. The creation of this department or funds is a problem.\nSpeaker 2: Looking for a solution. Or it's. Look, it's a non-problem. Looking for a solution and a waste of money. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Elaine Hutchison, then George Bustamante, then Alexandra Honoria. Elaine.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. Yes, Honorable Mayor Garcia and Vice Honorable Vice Mayor Richardson and members of the city council. My name is Elaine Hutchison, and I'm here this evening as president of the Apartment Association of California Southern Cities. Thank you very much for this opportunity to speak on item 36 of this evening's agenda.\nSpeaker 0: We appreciate all the research and work done by the Development Services staff, which was made possible by Councilwoman Cindy Helen and.\nSpeaker 7: Councilwoman Sui Sara, who brought the item forward. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. George Bustamante, Alexandra Raya and John Hammond. George.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Can I go to 49?\nSpeaker 6: Oh, I'm sorry. Continue. Forgive you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: And pause. I'm ready to roll.\nSpeaker 0: Governor, going to say we support option three.\nSpeaker 2: Let's back up the clock. Go for it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Thank you. George Bustamante, Alexandra Correa and John Hammond. All right. Good evening, vice mayor and council members.\nSpeaker 2: My name is George Bustamante. I live in Long Beach. I work in Long Beach. I work at the brokerage real estate brokerage business. I own a business here. And I just want to speak out against and oppose this.\nSpeaker 2: I'm 36 and all phases of it. It doesn't matter which one of these.\nSpeaker 6: It mainly impacts small.\nSpeaker 2: Small owners. They have, you know, two, three, four units, six units, ten units. Most of it is in their life savings. The numbers were interesting to see from staff. If we were only remodeling about a thousand units a year, that's not very many units that really need work to help.\nSpeaker 2: Provide better housing. Clean housing and safe housing. And most of the owners I know, they don't like people that they try to maintain their buildings and they try to improve them. In some cases, they need to move people out to make improvements.\nSpeaker 2: But putting further hindrances on landlords doesn't improve the housing stock, doesn't make more affordable housing, and just keeps the city in sort of a static state and probably deteriorating housing inventory. That's it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Alexandra and then John Edmund and then Matthew book. Alexandra.\nSpeaker 4: Honorable mayor, City.\nSpeaker 0: Council, City Manager and city staff. My name is Alex Catterall. I'm representing the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce and its membership in my comments. Both property owners and tenants who are represented by our coalition, which is made up of the Apartment Association of Southern California Cities Small Property Owners Alliance, California Apartment Association, the Civic West Association\nSpeaker 0: of Realtors and Chamber and the Chamber care about Long Beach and its future. As you may have seen in our petition, which has over 650 signatures from our membership, what we hear tenants say that they care about is homelessness, crime and quality of life.\nSpeaker 0: Property owners, provide rental housing to Long Beach residents and play a crucial role in Long Beach economy and city budget. Property owners also care about homelessness, crime, quality of life and the environment their tenants are living in because happy tenants mean happy property owners.\nSpeaker 0: Each of these property owners are small businesses that are trying to survive through a pandemic and all have chosen Long Beach as a worthy investment. Despite the housing stock needing more renovations and love than most in California due to the age of our housing, property owners, small businesses and tenants all want a safe and affordable environment.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next to John Edman there, Matthew Buck and Mike Murchison. I'm going to call out just a moment, John. I'm going to call out the next ten so they can begin a line up. You have Zach, you have Gratia Lopez Reyes, Maggie Valenzuela, just Seth Randall, Magdalena Pereda.\nSpeaker 2: Alyssa Tong.\nSpeaker 6: Andrew Mandu, Luciano, Lakisha Johnson, Paul working, and Maria Lopez. All right, John, you have the floor.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening, Vice Mayor, Councilmember, city manager and city staff. My name is John Edman. I'm the executive director of the Apartment Association of California Southern Cities. Well, my my members represent the free market, affordable housing providers. And I'm a resident in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 9: I have participated in every step of this process since early 2021. Tonight, we are discussing remedies for a problem that has yet to be supported by data. The common theme throughout this process is lack of data. This vote will have an effect for years to come on housing investments in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 9: Currently, we pay relocation fee, which we are open to discussing in future based on inflation and other other matters. Substantial years. Why don't we have a box to check when we're doing a permit application? We can track tenant relocations with the staff report.\nSpeaker 9: There is a distinct distinction with a difference between an eviction and canceling Alys. The state clearly defines nobody has any ambiguity of what a substantial remodel is, and we know it when we see it. It's ripping out plumbing, redoing electrical, and keeping up with our aging housing stock.\nSpeaker 9: Throughout this process, we have not heard one example of a tenant displaced under something that is not covered under current state law. And if it was done outside of state law, there are remedies available to them today and they should be held accountable.\nSpeaker 9: Additionally, we are observing a chill effect in Long Beach for investment in Long Beach properties through this moratorium and unnecessary environment. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: But thank you, John. And Mr. Clark, when we get to 90 seconds, you should intervene in managing this piece. We next have Matthew Buck, then Mike Murchison and then Zach Matthew.\nSpeaker 2: I thank you. Honorable Mayor and City Council. My name is Matthew Buck. I'm with the California Apartment Association. The staff report indicates no complaints have been received by the department on this issue zero. It's not because the city can't collect the data.\nSpeaker 2: It's easy to field complaints in the existing response base system. It's purely because there are no complaints regarding illegal upgrades. The Tenant Protection Act outlines specific criteria regarding substantial remodels to address an aging housing stock. The provisions in the law are not a loophole, but designed to encourage the maintenance and upkeep of the state's apartment homes.\nSpeaker 2: Over 70% of the housing in Long Beach was built before 1970. Your buildings need rehabilitation. Unnecessary regulations will deter needed upgrades and increase the cost to obtain housing. There's no evidence to support additional regulations are needed. We ask that the item be received and filed.\nSpeaker 2: Ensure your complaint based systems collecting data properly and increase education efforts to your residents. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Mike Murchison, the exacting grazier.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Vice Mayor, council members, city staff. I want to thank development services for taking the time over the past year and listening to everybody on both sides of this. Hopefully in 2022 we want to deal with tenant landlord issues.\nSpeaker 2: We've had enough in 2021, to be honest. You've also heard from everybody from the landlord side of things. The staff is basically figured out. There's been no there's been no data to substantiate what we've been discussing. None. So we have nothing factually to really fall back on.\nSpeaker 2: Number two, as said earlier, the state already has law about what a substantial remodel is. If you want to codify that for local here in the city, an ordinance by all means. But the state already has a law on it.\nSpeaker 2: As mentioned also, we have a very old housing stock here in Long Beach. What are we going to do to incentivize small property owners to basically come forward and improve their property? How are we going to do that if we're going to continue to hit them with exorbitant cost to make this all happen?\nSpeaker 2: Finally, the thing that bothers me probably the most is the cost of a RFP program. You heard earlier it's roughly two I think I heard 4 million. Eventually, development services, if they found the ability to pay for that, is going to pass that on to property owners.\nSpeaker 2: We can't pass that on to tenants. That's not a pass through costs. With 1482, you have a 5% raise increase annually plus CPI. You won't be able to pass through those additional costs. Keep that in mind. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next to Zach, then. Greasier than Maggie.\nSpeaker 9: You've had a lot of. You've got your glasses. Yes. Hi. My name is Zack and I'm a landlord. And I just want to tell you my story, which is this pandemic has basically run me into the ground. I'm having to work, too.\nSpeaker 9: I had to go back to school there and work two jobs to keep hold on to what I have. So when you guys add additional cost on us, it's not something that we can just afford. And just as a side note, my tenant is so I'm the government owes me $44,000 in unpaid rent and my tenant wants\nSpeaker 9: $10,000 bribe cash to cooperate with it because you guys put that stipulation that you have to cooperate. So I'm fighting like hell to hang on to what I have and adding more cost to us, more burdens is hard enough.\nSpeaker 9: Fall. I mean, I feel for these guys out here with the no eviction signs, but you guys have let 10,000 low cost units go away. You guys have let a bunch of Section eight go away. You guys, this is not a fault from the landlords.\nSpeaker 9: And this, for the most part, impacts only small landlords. And, you know, all you're going to get is a takeover from BlackRock, who's not gonna listen to you guys, all of them. They're gonna come in with their fancy lawyers and there's no chance for anybody then.\nSpeaker 9: So I'm asking you guys to reject this altogether. And lastly, when I can't afford when somebody can't afford to pay somebody to live somewhere else, they're just gonna start ripping out asbestos walls with that with the people still living there.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Grecia, then Maggi, then Hyacinth.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. Members of the council. My name is Graciela with RES. I'm the director of Leon's Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs in a Healthy Community and a member of the Housing Justice Coalition. First, I want to acknowledge the leadership of council members Cindy Allen and Julie Sano for taking proactive steps to address substantial remodel evictions.\nSpeaker 4: I also want to thank Council woman Mary Sunday House Vice Mayor Richard Richardson and Councilman Al Austin for taking the time to meet with members of the community to listen to our concerns around substantial remodeling. As you know, landlords are using substantial remodel as a reason to evict tenants from what are turning out to be minor repairs\nSpeaker 4: . Many tenants have asked for repairs for months or years in advance with no action. But with the hot housing market and the COVID 19 pandemic, landlords are using this loophole to take long term tenants out, make minor changes, and hike up the rent.\nSpeaker 4: For these reasons, we are in strong support of Option one as the only option that protects and unburdened Long Beach renters and prevents worsening homelessness in the city. We also support critical changes to option two, including an increase in permanent relocation assistance, adding temporary relocation assistance and adding affirmative defenses to evictions if landlords fail to notify the\nSpeaker 4: city or pay relocation. Finally, we ask the council to extend the eviction moratorium up to until the new ordinance goes into effect. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Maggie, then Hyacinth, and then Magnolia. Maggie.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, Catherine.\nSpeaker 4: Sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, council members.\nSpeaker 4: My name is Maggie Venezuela, and I'm the organizer with Lane.\nSpeaker 0: I'm here to uplift across the whole story. She couldn't be here today. Rosa is a resident at Signal Hill.\nSpeaker 4: But she lived in Long Beach for three years. She was told to leave her unit where she was paying.\nSpeaker 0: 1500 dollars a month because the building was bought by a new owner and they were going to renovate the unit. She could not stay. She moved to single here, where now she pays 30 $200 a rent. She's a 76 year old woman who.\nSpeaker 4: Barely make ends meet as a care worker. Most of her family and friends are not here anymore. When she was evicted, she didn't know what to do.\nSpeaker 0: Or who to talk to. She didn't have any help. Her family and her children don't live here. She did everything by herself. She doesn't wish this on anyone.\nSpeaker 4: Currently she's behind two months and is having to worry about possibly being evicted and move again.\nSpeaker 0: When she thinks about the stress and frustration she went through to find a place in less than a month. It brings her heartache because she never imagined that for these reasons. We ask for your strong support for option one.\nSpeaker 4: To address the loophole.\nSpeaker 0: Around substantial remodel and ensure safe and affordable housing in our community. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next, we have Husain, then Dalia and then Elsa tung.\nSpeaker 0: Actually.\nSpeaker 6: Jasim Jasim.\nSpeaker 4: I. Good evening. Mayor and.\nSpeaker 2: The council.\nSpeaker 7: Members.\nSpeaker 0: It appears to me that Long Beach, the city of Long Beach, is no longer the affordable residential haven for middle to lower class. Income residents want to make a comfortable and safe, long term home with the never ending pandemic.\nSpeaker 0: It appears, though, that all.\nSpeaker 5: Predatory landlord landlords are on the.\nSpeaker 0: Alert to make themselves unjustly enriched. My very first apartment in Long Beach was in 2012.\nSpeaker 4: And even.\nSpeaker 0: Before I signed the contract, which by the way, I was not allowed to read, even though I asked for. I have experienced. Continuous forms of inhumane inhumanity. Violations of tenants rights and dehumanizing acts which go unchecked. And. That even includes false advertising.\nSpeaker 0: After surviving these various forms of degradation. I prevailed in court, but not with any help. Even though the city had come in and found.\nSpeaker 2: The errors.\nSpeaker 0: And necessary repairs were.\nSpeaker 2: Not. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next we have Magnolia, then Elsa and Andrew. There's double the times. There's an interpreter.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'm not sure if we have another concert coming over to your third anniversary. If I keep working for the government, they'll say, Look at the unnecessary part. I can be a foreman because they're not political, though even then, it's roughly that level of socialism problem out there in a society that is astoundingly some government enterprise\nSpeaker 0: , along with this blossoming stuff, especially mental illness, profit areas playing on mental illness are killers. It's not fact. I like this. Are you and others like you? Listen, I thought you left. We went to an apartment. I said, you like it?\nSpeaker 0: I'm going to stay. In fact, I got it right out of L.A.. Maria Soccer one guy. Sebastian Palermo. Right long on a player for me. God, you're so physical. Mental capacity. There's a lot more than supporting me, going to persuade me that the Camorra to deliver, but they'll see the start of them and they're not.\nSpeaker 0: Enter. You go. I'm not going to do a lot of sport. Not for me. Going to look cheering. Yes, sir. Stackhouse on the stairs. Get on there and meet Elizabeth Racine. No, but I must say, you've been with the provisional.\nSpeaker 0: You know, the longest time was political. Mazzoli law's kind of protecting a lot of the local Adobe and other secular Israelis. Unless you left the remainder of the system either, even if monolithically not in the role of a citizen.\nSpeaker 0: So I must tell you that to start considering this option is going to respect one another. Last year's extension of which are luxury, are non-nuclear, but clearly not eliminate Ludmila substantial but more naturalistically step out of the Salahis.\nSpeaker 0: Say, what are the key thing I'm supposed to pilot a policy on? And so you can ask for attention.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, council members.\nSpeaker 0: My name is Maccabi Tel Aviv and I'm a resident of District nine. I'm here because I am committed to doing whatever it takes to change the district, to change the way housing policies are made in our city. Substantial remodeling is a real problem in our city, and this loophole is being used as a tool for unjust eviction\nSpeaker 0: and displacement, specifically so that landlords can significantly raise rents. This impacts access to affordable housing in our city. I live in an unaffordable apartment that is infested with roaches. My landlord gave me one day's notice to move all my staff from the unit so they could fumigate.\nSpeaker 0: I was physically incapable of doing the move on my own and my husband and son work late. The landlord tried to increase my rent as a result and this has caused an enormous amount of stress. We cannot continue allowing landlords to take advantage of Long Beach renters.\nSpeaker 0: We need stronger policies in place that protect us from eviction and the lack of affordable housing in the city. Substantial remodel is another loophole in our housing system that puts renters at risk of evictions. We ask that you support option one, which will protect renters, eliminate substantial remodel as a just cause for eviction, and ensure that we\nSpeaker 0: have a fair process for repairs. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Ailsa Chang, then Andrew and then Lucretia.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. Council Members Ailsa Chang, Long Beach, Forward District seven resident and actually, yes, a landlord in a different jurisdiction. Thank you Councilmember sorrow and Allen for your leadership in the age of COVID Delta and now all Macron evictions equals death.\nSpeaker 0: Council members, if you don't want that on your conscience, then adopt critical improvements tonight. First, extend the substantial remodel eviction moratorium all the way until the new ordinance goes into effect. Second, adopt option one, which is what the renter majority ultimately needs.\nSpeaker 0: Look, if that's not in the cards tonight, then combine and amend options two and three with the following six specific changes. Number one, revise the definition of substantial remodel to a 90 day threshold. Number two, increase permanent relocation assistance aligned with L.A. County's reload program, which, for instance, provides $16,000 to a lower income household displaced from a\nSpeaker 0: two bedroom unit. Three Add temporary relocation assistance, also aligned with the county. Four Strike the word intentionally regarding the civil fine. Five At a private right to action for a tenant to sue with for civil penalty and attorney's fees.\nSpeaker 0: This is simply a deterrent. And six, an affirmative defenses.\nSpeaker 5: To unlawful detainers.\nSpeaker 0: If the landlord fails to notify the city of a substantial removal eviction or fails to pay permanent relocation assistance. Stop evictions now. Up. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Andrew and then Lucretia Johnson and then Paul working.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. My name is Andrew with the Long Beach Tenants Union, which is comprised of the 64 Street Daisy and Orange Resistances. Over the past two years, you've have gotten to know their faces, their families and their struggles. Most importantly, you've gotten to know their fearlessness, their unwavering commitment to do what is needed to move you all to\nSpeaker 2: act. We saw this before the pandemic when adopting the home for the holidays eviction moratorium during the pandemic, when advocating for a tenant anti-harassment policy and key budget acts such as housing, navigators and right to counsel. And for the past few months, asking to remove substantial remodel as a just cause reason for eviction.\nSpeaker 2: While the tactics these tenants have organized and led, such as visits to your homes, are unorthodox, they were effective in passing an unprecedented amount of tenant protections and building the strongest renter power this city has ever seen. This brings us here today where we are asking you all, especially those of you who call yourselves our allies, to\nSpeaker 2: stand with us and adopt option one to remove substantial remodel as a just cause for eviction and establish a renovation administration program. Furthermore, we ask you to combine options two and three and allow the right for tenants to choose either temporary relocation, including maintaining the rights to tenancy at current rent or permanent relocation.\nSpeaker 2: The profits of a few shouldn't be prioritized over the lives of many. We hope you all stand on the side of history and believe yourselves that housing is a human right.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Lucretia Johnson. Is Lucretia here? Okay, then Paul working, then Maria Lopez. Paul, just a moment. I'm going to call the next ten speakers to line up. You have Antonia, then Katie, Deonna, Marlene Alvarado, Paul Abad, Paula Abad, Liana Noble, Jordan.\nSpeaker 6: When Karen Reside, Karen was Ric and Harvey Holt and Christine Schachter. So, Paul, you're up. Hi. My name is Paul working. I like to think that city council members give me a chance to speak. Right. I am currently a resident of District one.\nSpeaker 6: I am speaking for everyone who has gone through what I'm going through right now. This is just a few of the many issues that are experiencing the current time and our residents. We have no fire alarms. We have no keys to get in and out and black mold on the ceilings and walls, including mushrooms growing from the\nSpeaker 6: ceilings.\nSpeaker 2: Zero security.\nSpeaker 6: Very, very strange. Super dangerous at night. Not hardly any lighting. So when we asked for repairs, we responded to the terror level and responded by giving us our eviction notice. What brings me here today is to ask you to adopt option one to remove substantial.\nSpeaker 6: Remodel just for just cause of eviction and establish and renovation administration program. And that's. Doesn't go through. I'm not sure what my friends and myself are going to have, what options it will have left. So that's it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Next is Maria Lopez, then Antonia and Katie. Marie, are you here?\nSpeaker 0: I think. Yeah, I'm here.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Go for it.\nSpeaker 4: Why not, Chef? Good evening. My name is Maria Lopez. I'm a proud tenant and District one and a daughter of a small landlord in District eight. In my family, we agree that evictions are not solutions. So we ask you to decide on option one all rights that a rent sorry, a rental administration program would alleviate so much\nSpeaker 4: stress and alleviate so much stress off of you all two. But first and foremost, we ask that if that is not an option, that you combine option two and three along the lines of also extending the eviction moratorium until the end of February 2022.\nSpeaker 4: In addition to supporting my colleagues that have already included that in the definition of substantial remodel, to include the work that would require tenants of at least 90 days. To be more specific on what I would as a person who has been evicted and displaced through the legal system, relocation assistance was not offered to me at the\nSpeaker 4: time, and so I would highly encourage you all to look at L.A. County's model and adopt that as well. In that same note, I would it would be for permanent and temporary relocation assistance. And the most important, as someone who has gone through the unlawful detainer process, is that you all add an affirmative defense to unlawful detainers\nSpeaker 4: if and when the landlord fails to pay low or fails to notify the city of subsequent. Francisco, thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next we have Antonia, then Katie, then Marlene.\nSpeaker 0: What I noticed at the last minute.\nSpeaker 4: Antonia, that an assistant to the center like.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening, everyone. My name is Antonia from Residential 64.\nSpeaker 0: I presented Bogota Hoy example, and it was our episode that I found the most by my family.\nSpeaker 9: Even though we had a lack of work and we had to use our savings and even though we faced the pandemic, we were able to pay rent month after month.\nSpeaker 0: Gear up the Alaska patrol that CNN and don't let on what I thought the contrary is a local sport of the modern nation.\nSpeaker 9: I want you to please once more close the loophole on the moratorium on evictions once and for all.\nSpeaker 0: And we knew then that if you show them a keen interest in a center, cuatro durante la Pandemia Mendoza Ramone, L.A. Apartamento is.\nSpeaker 9: The owner of the building on 540 64th Street, essentially remodel the building's apartments and without the permits from the city.\nSpeaker 0: Cinematography. Is that almost an acquired antenna? You know up I have autism that I haven't seen less protection in the society.\nSpeaker 9: Without taking into account that we were in the quarantine and the workers were coming in without protections.\nSpeaker 0: And I know that only percent of myself rent.\nSpeaker 9: And then rent went up 8%.\nSpeaker 0: Durante la pandemia.\nSpeaker 9: During the pandemic.\nSpeaker 0: That was Corberan and I was in that red already though. Today I was up. What about if I'm into.\nSpeaker 9: What I also charge for water when there is no and a device to measure the water consumption per apartment unit.\nSpeaker 0: That is in parking.\nSpeaker 9: Lot. We pay $100 for parking.\nSpeaker 0: And other than most here in Colorado, Colorado, those million dollars for a camera.\nSpeaker 9: So in total, we're paying $2,000 for a one bedroom.\nSpeaker 0: And I was doing your suicide moratoria that I'm one of the lucky owners of our water.\nSpeaker 9: So the owners are using the moratorium, the remodeling as a on their own favor.\nSpeaker 0: Let's be look at bong and poquito that the end zone some Angelinos camels that oh but I love going to see thermals get them in Athens you know.\nSpeaker 9: So we ask you please pay attention to us the tenants that are being able to pay month after month. Please pay attention to us.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. One analogies.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next we have Katie, then Marlene, then Paula.\nSpeaker 0: Hi, I'm Katie. Emma. And although I won't be helped by the measures tonight, many of my neighbors will. 17 specifically units that would be saved by the difference between a 30 day threshold and.\nSpeaker 7: A 60 or 90 day.\nSpeaker 0: Threshold. And some of them are here, including Pat in a wheelchair, Daryn, with a walker.\nSpeaker 2: These are people.\nSpeaker 0: Who will be immediately impacted by the difference between a 30 day and a 60 day threshold of how long the work is going to take. That's an important thing. And 90 days.\nSpeaker 7: Would be even better.\nSpeaker 0: Rental relocation assistance will be great to have that in there. But. For 40 $500. If you're moving, if you're kicked out of a 440 $500 house.\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to get.\nSpeaker 0: Into another one without three month's rent on hand.\nSpeaker 7: So. It's just a random number that doesn't.\nSpeaker 5: Look at the reality of the situation.\nSpeaker 2: And there's no.\nSpeaker 0: Support at all for temporary.\nSpeaker 2: Relocation. So those are some.\nSpeaker 7: Things that would need to be addressed to make now the option to stronger. Option one is still the goal and hopefully you will continue working on that.\nSpeaker 0: Until you come up with the money. But in the meantime, option to could make a.\nSpeaker 7: Really big difference in incorporated with option three.\nSpeaker 0: There are important things in there that can really help save tenants, keep.\nSpeaker 5: Them in their homes, and still.\nSpeaker 0: Allow landlords the option of providing that temporary relocation.\nSpeaker 5: And bringing people back. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Marlene and then Paula and Liana.\nSpeaker 4: Hello, my name is Marlene Alvarado. I actually am a landlord.\nSpeaker 0: Not in this year, but another. And I always think it's just and fair and.\nSpeaker 4: Humane.\nSpeaker 0: To extend the.\nSpeaker 4: Substantial remodeling.\nSpeaker 0: Eviction moratorium until the new ordinance goes into effect, which may be after February 28, 2022, as proposed by the item number two, adopt up option one to remove substantial remodeling as a just cause for eviction and establish renovate of administrative program administered by the Department of Services.\nSpeaker 0: The Development Service Department Combine and amend Option two and three, which is currently written. Fall to protect fail to protect the renter majority.\nSpeaker 4: We urge the City.\nSpeaker 0: Council to make the following critical fixes to option two.\nSpeaker 4: And three.\nSpeaker 0: Revise the definition of substantial remodeling to.\nSpeaker 4: Include work that would require a tenant to vacate for at least 90 days and increase permanent relocation.\nSpeaker 0: Assistance at temporary relocation assistance.\nSpeaker 4: Eliminate intentional requirement for civil fine. Increase Civil five $15,000.\nSpeaker 0: Should be the minimum fine, not the maximum add private rights of action, but time has expired. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next we have Paula, then Liana, then Jordan. Paula here.\nSpeaker 9: I'm not. I'm party.\nSpeaker 6: Is Paula here? Now, Lianna, is Lianna here? I'm on Leona. And then Jordan. And then Karen.\nSpeaker 4: My name's Lana.\nSpeaker 0: Noble.\nSpeaker 4: I'm here tonight as the interim volunteer director of Leave. Right. You've said tonight, Virgin, right from the city, that one.\nSpeaker 0: Of your concerns as elected.\nSpeaker 4: Officials is data. You know, my question is, why isn't the city collecting the data that is related to the majority of our residents who happen to be renters? 60% of the residents of this city are renters. In neighborhoods where I live and close to where I live.\nSpeaker 4: Renters are 90% of the renters. So there are entire huge areas of our city where the residents are renters. And they are here telling you again and again. That there is suffering. There are loopholes in this ordinance. We're glad that we made the progress we have, but we have shared with you specific changes.\nSpeaker 0: Modifications.\nSpeaker 4: That are doable. So if you're going to put it on our shoulders as renters to fight for fair housing, then you need to make these changes. So when we go to court, we have a chance to win. That's what we're asking for.\nSpeaker 4: You make changes so we can get past expired. Have to go to court.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next, Jordan. When Karen resigned, Karen was Rick Jordan. Good evening.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Jordan Wynn, resident of District two and member of the Housing Justice Coalition. I am here in support, strong support of adopting option one, removing removing substantial role models, a just cause for eviction, establishing a renovation administrative program administered by the Development Services Department.\nSpeaker 3: This is what our tenants really need, and it's a common sense policy that other municipalities have already adopted. Liana put it best We need to start collecting the data, but truly, do you want the data? Here we are.\nSpeaker 3: Living, breathing data. Here in the audience we are complaining. We are the tenants who have been fighting and continuing the hard work of attending the past sessions, of telling you these stories again and again. Again. How many times you have to hear that tenants need help in the city and it's not without insistence from advocates to collect\nSpeaker 3: data in our city. As the report said, 879 multi-unit developments filed for substantial rehabilitation, meaning that thousands potentially of individuals and families affected. Let's be honest, this data issue goes beyond tonight's decision. Long Beach needs to act proactively to aid tenants who've been coming here and telling you they need help for years.\nSpeaker 3: Does the city want to remain blind to the issues of the majority of its population without the support of its city and the law behind them? Tenants are scared to report, often feeling powerless and don't know their rights.\nSpeaker 3: And of course, landlords won't be reporting something that they're doing under the table. Who shows up? Tenants show up because housing is a human right. The cost of this program pales in comparison to the need that we have in our city.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Next is Karen reside in Karen was Rick then Harvey Holt.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. My name.\nSpeaker 4: Is Karen Reside and I'm the.\nSpeaker 5: President of the Long Beach Gray.\nSpeaker 0: Panthers.\nSpeaker 4: And every day.\nSpeaker 0: I get 2 to 3 seniors that come into the senior center. With letters from their landlords.\nSpeaker 5: They're increasing their.\nSpeaker 4: Lats.\nSpeaker 0: Or they're giving them 30 day.\nSpeaker 4: Eviction notices illegally.\nSpeaker 0: Sent them immediately to legal aid to help them fight this. So we know the landlords. We do have some data.\nSpeaker 4: We know that there.\nSpeaker 5: Are buildings that are.\nSpeaker 4: Evicting all of their tenants to do remodeling. So we have data there. And a lot of those.\nSpeaker 0: Buildings housed seniors. The landlords pick on the seniors because they think the seniors.\nSpeaker 4: Won't complain and won't.\nSpeaker 0: Fight it. We participated in the process and we support the Housing Justice Coalition recommendations.\nSpeaker 4: But we wanted.\nSpeaker 0: Added extra provision for seniors. Seniors, I can't tell.\nSpeaker 5: You the number of seniors.\nSpeaker 4: That have had to move out of state.\nSpeaker 0: That used to come to the senior center and they're now all gone. So I know at least 40 the people that I ate lunch with had to move out of state because they had.\nSpeaker 4: Unreasonable increases in their rent.\nSpeaker 0: We have to collect the data. We know that landlords, not all landlords are bad, but there's a lot that aren't good. So and this causes undue stress on seniors and probably have cost lives.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. So Harvey's next. And then. And then. Excuse me, Karen was Rick and then Harvey. But before you go, Karen, why you went to make your way? I want to call it the last five speakers Michael Lapointe, Daniel Sherwood, Mary Duong, Winston de Laurier and Vilma.\nSpeaker 6: Okay, so, Karen, you're up.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you for having me here. I love you. Nice. I was here a couple months ago, and I wanted to, first of all, say a thank you with these ordinance amendments. And I hope most of them get taken.\nSpeaker 4: Four voted for. I have a little difficulty sometimes with my words. And so please excuse excuse me. One of the things I wanted to talk about was, you know, it's what's talked about if major. You know, increasing, they're making them better and so forth and so on.\nSpeaker 4: And that's what our owner wants to do. But they're not doing it to make it nice for us. They're making it more expensive so that other people come in after us. And as much as $1,000 more for the same place I've been living where I live for 20 years.\nSpeaker 4: And my very nice landlord. Except that she did. She got older and she sold it. So now a company holds it and they do not have the same heart. And they as she did. And she now.\nSpeaker 0: More times expire. What? Oh, is that all?\nSpeaker 6: I'll finish your sentence.\nSpeaker 4: She occasionally would increase the rent, but not every year. Our new deck per people are there two years and I've had to over $100 each. Thank you. Increase.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Next is Harvey Hope and Christine Schachter.\nSpeaker 9: Hello. My name's Harvey Holt. I work 56 hours a week. I'm 37. Excuse me. You have to put on an hour. I thought I'd take it off right here. I live with my parents until this march. And I lived them in a one bedroom.\nSpeaker 9: In a bedroom with my wife and my son also that I could save money to buy a property. And I bought a four unit property here in Long Beach. I went to Centennial High in Compton. And what I learned from being a property owner is not always about all you.\nSpeaker 9: You increasing things to make money, you're increasing things to improve it, to keep it, to keep up with inflation. So like, for example, the place up by I did a one bedroom for me and my wife and kids are moving into contractors wanting a $40,000 to remodel a one bedroom, 600 square foot apartment like f the F\nSpeaker 9: . I had to redo the lady door unit next to mine. Like I would have to recoup that cost. And even over what, seven, eight years, I still wouldn't recoup it. And she only she only pays 900. But I'll replace the windows, I replaced the plumbing, and I didn't have to displace anyone to replace the windows and plumbing\nSpeaker 9: . But if I had to redo that unit, which eventually I will like, I have to recoup that cost. So I think. Don't you think, oh, we want to put people out. No, it's like, yo, I work 56 hours a week.\nSpeaker 9: I think you have to let me at least recoup my money.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Christine Schachter, then Michael Lapointe, then Daniel Sharwood.\nSpeaker 9: And 30 $200.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, sir.\nSpeaker 9: For 30 $200. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: All right, Christine, Christina, respectfully, we need to just respect the process. Thank you. All right. Christina.\nSpeaker 0: Christine Schecter with Christine. Season of Realtors. Yeah, thank you. Representing about 13,000 members here locally in August, our coalition submitted a written request to the. For further information on the scope and impact of the eviction problem related to renovations, which people have discussed here tonight attempting to review this since July all bids.\nSpeaker 0: His response was the Housing Neighborhood Services Bureau has not received any complaints from any individuals regarding substantial remodels. Beginning in August of last year, almost a year and a half ago, state laws, AB 30, 88, SB 91 and AB 32 extended just cause of perfection evictions to all properties under AB 1482, including single family homes and condos\nSpeaker 0: , and prevented termination of tenancy based on the intent to demolish or substantially remodel the residential real property unless to comply with Stevie Code. Sorry, I'm having a hard time breathing through spring 2022 and next year property owners are required to take steps in compliance with state law to demonstrate their mean good faith efforts to seek rental assistance\nSpeaker 0: for a tenant they've worked with. Additionally, this work is currently suspended in L.A. County due to emergency procedures through spring of next year. We urge you to consider the ramifications of new bureaucracy and unwieldy programs and urge you to look to current tenant assistance, Iraq funding and how to implement current policy.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Michael Lapointe, then Daniel Sherwood, the married one. I don't know. Okay. We don't see Michael. Next is Daniel.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, City Council. My name is Daniel Sherwood. I've been a resident of Long Beach for 35 years. So what I know about Long Beach is I love the city, and I know that the city has prided itself on diversity and quality of life.\nSpeaker 2: But I also know that as we have an awful homeless situation, mental illness and violence on our streets. And we have a lack of affordable rents. We too, went through the same thing. A company came in and bought our 27 unit and a 24 unit.\nSpeaker 2: We share a pool. The first year, they evicted 90% of the residents in Obispo for substantial remodel. So the rest of us that hung tight. We were on pins and needles. We never knew whether we were going to get to stay or whether we're going to get to go.\nSpeaker 2: And that's that's not a great way to live. And so I concur with everybody here tonight. It's an awful place to be in. So what did we get when they revamped these buildings and made them high end apartment buildings?\nSpeaker 2: We went from 1000 to 20 to 50 for a one bedroom. We went from 1250 to 20 to 50 for a two bedroom or 2450 for a two bedroom. Our pool we had the heater was taken out, the security system was removed.\nSpeaker 2: And the elevators, they're not painted. The maintenance is awful and your time is up. It is deplorable. Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Our final three speakers, Mary Duong, Winston and Vilma. Mary.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, senior counsel. My name is Mary Yoon. I am a pastor and a faith rooted organizer with Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice. I want to say thank you to CASA member Alan and CASA member Sarah for your leadership in bringing this item up.\nSpeaker 4: I myself was impacted by substantial remodel or eviction when I was in graduate school. I remember that my landlord never had a conversation with me regarding compensation for relocation expenses. It was stressful to be in graduate school and to work at the same time, and it was more stressful and more overwhelming, like when you lost your affordable\nSpeaker 4: housing. And I can imagine families with children going through that right now during this pandemic. I think we need to address that. There is an unequal power relationship between landlords and tenants. Substantial remodel as a just cost makes tenants more vulnerable to eviction at any moment and be at the mercy of their landlords.\nSpeaker 4: And this power imbalance creates the conditions for power abuse, as we have heard in many testimonies tonight. So to shift this power imbalance, I believe that option one is the best solution because it will remove substantial remodel as a just cause and also it will provide oversight to landlords so that responsible repairs can be made and also\nSpeaker 4: affordable housing is ensure for tenants. In my Christian tradition, the prophets teach that God identifies yourself with the vulnerable in society. So I ask that the CD Council we vote on option one to support our tenants as well.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Winston then Vilma.\nSpeaker 2: Hello, folks. My name is Winston Deloria. I'm live in the six councilwoman Sara's district. Just have a few things to say. First of all, I strongly urge the council to adopt option one in the event that option two is selected.\nSpeaker 2: I would very strongly urge even any any decision is made. I believe the moratorium should remain in place until it can be implemented. I think to do otherwise just is inviting landlords to evict tenants preemptively. Secondly, I believe the 60 day notice well, I actually believe that was increased from 90 day notice.\nSpeaker 2: I believe that's a good move. Relocation assistance, I believe, should be increased to match the L.A. County guidelines. And then the the other point I want to make here is just very briefly, we're not just talking about individuals, right.\nSpeaker 2: And you're talking about individual families. You know, we hear a lot about the free market solution here. The free market solution to this is poor people. Well, the kids get roommates with, you know, four people to a studio apartment and working families moved to Victorville.\nSpeaker 2: I think our communities have a right to exist and we're going to fight for that right to exist. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Our final speakers, Velma.\nSpeaker 0: Why not have this mean armrest, Wilma.\nSpeaker 9: Wouldn't he? My name is Wilma.\nSpeaker 0: De la Assistenza and I sent a Quattro this reconnoiter.\nSpeaker 9: From District nine residency of the 64th Green.\nSpeaker 0: It must a and moratorium control of this handover.\nSpeaker 9: We want the eviction moratorium to be extended.\nSpeaker 0: As a serious lawyer, the suspension.\nSpeaker 9: And the look on the substantial remodeling is closed.\nSpeaker 0: I mean. Yes, almost.\nSpeaker 9: Canceled the dance.\nSpeaker 0: Performances.\nSpeaker 9: Well, so tired of so many friends.\nSpeaker 5: Apathy that prevent.\nSpeaker 0: Other of the pregnant men that don't have to get the the most get back. I've seen a lot of the fucking.\nSpeaker 9: Scenes of this were the first they told us they gave us a notice that we had to pay $100 parking. I mean, I've seen parking.\nSpeaker 0: Almost, but do not say well enough.\nSpeaker 9: Or do not no check.\nSpeaker 0: You know, by.\nSpeaker 9: Threatening us that if we park the car for a few minutes or even overnight, they will take the car away from us. And then what has to happen? Know you can help out another guy. We beg you. Please pay attention to us and do something for us.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. That concludes public comment. We'll go to Councilwoman Allen and the maker of the motion.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Vice Mayor. I want to first start by thanking Oscar, Christopher Patrick and everyone at DVS for their hard work and insights on this issue. This item today is exactly what we asked for back in July, and I really appreciate all the time and the outreach that was spent on putting this together.\nSpeaker 0: I also want to recognize my co-sponsor on the original, original item, Councilwoman Sorrow and the Cosigners Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilwoman Zendejas for their partnership and support. And we definitely wouldn't be here today without all of you. I also want to take a moment to recognize all the tenant and property groups and individuals who reached out to\nSpeaker 0: my office and participated in the process. With the city and voice their questions and concerns. So thank you for your opinions. Thank you for your experiences. All of this really matters to me. So. Diving into this item. I appreciate the policy options presented today.\nSpeaker 0: My staff recommendation, I would like to pursue option one and I do support creation of a rap. But due to the city's fiscal situation, it doesn't seem possible at this time. Creating a way to manage projects was the purpose of the initial policy directive, and we still need to find a way that allows for units to be\nSpeaker 0: upgraded without displacing residents. But current budget projections will not make this immediately feasible. We need more time and planning to identify and allocate the kind of funding for Iraq. This option also takes a very long time to implement, and it would take at least one year or longer to develop the program and hire staff.\nSpeaker 0: I think there are actions that we can take here now that will make a difference similar to the SAS recommendation. I support moving forward with a hybrid solution that contains option three and elements of option two with modifications.\nSpeaker 0: These are things that we can do today at lower costs to the city and landlords increasing their relocation assistance to 4500, it would be very beneficial. This would provide a lot of relief for residents. And this figure is significantly less than the L.A. County relocation amounts.\nSpeaker 0: So I do support this option, and I'd like this to be 4500 or two months for rent, whichever is greater. Is that something that we can do?\nSpeaker 6: Yes. That's a change we could make.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then from option two, I support, including numbers three, four and five and removing numbers one and two. So establishing a fine for landlords who violate our city's just cause ordinance, I think, is a strong deterrent against bad actors.\nSpeaker 0: Additionally, providing a 90 day notice to vacate also helps tenants better manage and remodel a better manager remodel process. I'm very excited about point number four, particularly the data collection aspect of it. I think that it's just what we need to better understand the extent of substantial remodel related displacement in our city.\nSpeaker 0: So I would like to make the motion and move forward with a hybrid solution that contains a modified option. Three. And points three, four and five from option two.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Next thing I saw, a cup of jersey.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: There are also a few things that I'd like to request in addition to that. Could we include language and option three that clarifies the relocation benefit disbursement information? Is it a lump sum or will payments be divided and when will the payments be issued?\nSpeaker 6: So we can include all of those items. But if you have specific direction as to what your preferences are, you would need to let us know because I don't think we have a specific staff recommendation on.\nSpeaker 2: On exactly how the disbursement works.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I definitely would like to hear from my colleagues. And then I do have a call. I do have one last question. I know what's going to be lost. But we heard that there's been no data on substantial remodel evictions.\nSpeaker 0: And I know in your report you say while the claims are valid, it is possible that the displacements are concentrated in certain buildings. So you're saying they're likely valid, but but why is there no data on this effort on this?\nSpeaker 6: So we believe one of the most important things in front of council is to create a mandatory reporting requirement for a substantial remodel. Today, there is no reporting requirement. So what happens is a landlord within their rights issues a non-judicial, you know, notice to vacate a 60 day notice.\nSpeaker 6: And if the tenant complies with the notice that's not forwarded to the city, it's not forwarded to the courts. It's it's not shared with any third party. So it's not that there is no data. It's that there is not sufficient data that the city is party to.\nSpeaker 6: Because we don't currently have any right to that data or a way to access that data. So what we did was look at indirect evidence. We looked at building permits. There was some information about, you know, sheriffs enforced evictions, but that does not those are indirect indicators.\nSpeaker 6: That's not the direct information which we don't have today.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next is Councilwoman Ciro.\nSpeaker 4: Thanks, Vice Mayor. I also want to reiterate my thanks to staff for their hard work in bringing this item back and as well as to all of our advocates and tenants and property owners and advocates on their comment and feedback on this item.\nSpeaker 4: And I will second councilmember and I want to thank Councilmember Allen for her leadership on this item. And we'll second it. But I have some friendly amendments, some friendly to make on the motion. I like to make a friendly to adding option 2.1.\nSpeaker 4: I think revising the definition of the statute remodeled include work that would require a tenant to vacant for at least 60 days as opposed to the 30. Is a strong policy that allows good faith landlord to renovate their property at their discretion and provide some protection for tenants as well.\nSpeaker 4: So I'd like to hear from my colleagues on this. And the other is I would like to amend option 2.32 rather saying fine up to 15,000 is to start at 15,000 and to strike out intentionally. And lastly, while I understand that option one at the moment is physically, physically not possible, but I like to ask that we\nSpeaker 4: get a report back with a year's worth of data, a substantial remodel related eviction. I think that this will give us a better sense on what the situation is in Long Beach, and that the report also include possible additional resources for funding the wrap in updated cost figures as well.\nSpeaker 4: And that concludes my comment.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. That was a request for three friendlies. Did you want to respond now? Do you want to wait?\nSpeaker 0: You know, if I could, I wait and just hear from my colleagues.\nSpeaker 6: All right, Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I want to thank everyone who came out tonight on both sides of the issue. I did listen to and really took some notes on some of the things that were said. But when Karen and I don't I don't want to say her last name incorrectly, but caring who came to the dais and really talked about\nSpeaker 5: how her small landlord sold and a big company bought the building. I think that more and more of that is happening because when I talk to people who have the opportunity to invest and potentially keep an original property and move and buy a property and then rent out their old property or invest and buy a multi-unit, they're\nSpeaker 5: very discouraged because of the complexities of being a landlord. And with each and every day, it gets more and more complex and there's more and more struggles for them to know and understand. And more things that could put them under and make their investment a just a money pit of frustration.\nSpeaker 5: You already have the risks of a tenant not being able to pay rent and or a tenant or a natural disaster like we've had where you would be put in a position to not receive rent for long periods of time where you may still be required to pay that mortgage and go through the processes and paperwork to\nSpeaker 5: get those requirements. So and while I'm very supportive of a solution that makes sense for all. I think that one of the things that we do need to talk about as a community is that if we want. Individuals who live locally to own the properties that our neighbors are renting.\nSpeaker 5: Instead of these big companies and corporations. We need to talk about what we can do to make it easy on them. Because the types of people who don't raise rent are your neighbors. When your neighbors own the property you live in, they're the ones who are the best landlords because they're the ones who live in Long Beach\nSpeaker 5: and they care about you. These big companies aren't aren't the way of the way we want to go. And so I think with each policy, I don't know if there's a way to differentiate who the policies apply to.\nSpeaker 5: But I think that the best case scenario for us as a city is that the larger percentage of the housing stock that's owned locally by neighbors, the better position all our renters would be in. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you for the discussion and thanks for everyone who came out especially. I want to thank staff for undergoing this huge process. And Patrick, you've done amazing work on it, so I appreciate that. I appreciate the comments from my colleagues and I support I'm going to support this item.\nSpeaker 4: And Councilwoman Allen's motion, I'm not sure about the friendlies that the one that I personally don't want to see in there is 2.1. But again, I want to hear my colleagues thoughts on that. But that wasn't part of the initial motion by Councilwoman Allen.\nSpeaker 4: And I just I don't believe it's necessary based on the staff presentation that we have received and some of the areas of of. Input that staff has highlighted from the community meetings. But other than that, I'm supportive of the motion and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Councilmember Surana. Thank you. I have a follow up on Councilwoman Sorrells friendly, and I'm not sure if that's been accepted yet, but I'm all for getting the data as was referenced by everyone here tonight. But my concern is the cost.\nSpeaker 6: And if staff knows how we would pay for that, I see. I think there's potentially a large concern that either be borne by the city.\nSpeaker 2: Or the landlords through fees.\nSpeaker 6: Do you have any immediate reaction to that? So that's not our intention. Council Member So we have to work through some security issues, but theoretically this would be a Google form that landlords would have a log in to.\nSpeaker 6: They would log in, note the location, address the unit number, the landlord's contact information and upload a copy of the notice and that would fulfill their reporting requirement. So if their cost is not zero, but we would anticipate it not to be a substantial cost.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I think I understand that answer, that we could lessen the cost due to technology, but we would still have cost in notifying landlords or through any program like this. There are some costs. But I think I'm hearing you say that is not substantial to what you're looking at.\nSpeaker 6: That's that's correct. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Arango.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Rates there in you know, for purposes of transparency, I have met with people regarding the the issue regarding the this item here. And I looked at it and asked, well, isn't there like a fourth option that could be together?\nSpeaker 2: And I guess the fourth option is sort of their presenta right now, as Councilmember Allard has put together in terms of putting items two and three together. Obviously, we had a budget presentation earlier today. Option one would not be feasible at all.\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it's just impossible for us to be able to finance any kind of new program through the city if it's, you know, worth $2 million or even more. I do support the friendly that were brought forward recently with the council member.\nSpeaker 2: So I think that getting data is very important and I think staff would be able to work it out. And so I am very supportive of the friendlies as well to have, you know, the make of the motion would accept the friendly.\nSpeaker 2: Perfectly good with that as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I know I was a little torn on this particular item from the very beginning because I didn't feel like the data was there to actually support the need for a policy. But after hearing from public comment, there's obviously a great deal of concern in the community about this this issue, which obviously we all hear behind\nSpeaker 2: this day. I think our city staff, we have an interest in keeping people housed. Is the morals, the ethical thing to do? One point that came out earlier from staff's report is 80% of our housing stock in the city was is over 30 years old.\nSpeaker 2: And that's something that that's a fact that we can't be lost on. We know that there as a result, there will be investments. We should be encouraging property owners to invest in their properties because we don't want to be a city that encourages blight or subpar living conditions for our residents.\nSpeaker 2: That said, I do think that this this item or this information that's on the floor is is a balanced motion. It makes a lot of sense. I do have questions about the friendly in terms of 2.3. And the question is more for the city attorney in terms of does it start at 15,000 or does it max at\nSpeaker 2: 15,000 or. Is it is it incumbent upon this body right now to set set that that that that that ceiling or floor for record it is councilmember out and you'd be giving. Future Superior Court judges guidance on what they can and can't do.\nSpeaker 2: And I think, as everyone knows currently as written, the fines for intentional violation could be anywhere between zero and 15,000. The friendly would force a judge to levy a fine of 15,000 and up. And as the friendly, at least I heard there was no maximum limit on on a fine that a judge might impose.\nSpeaker 2: And it's purely within your discretion to do it either way. And can can staff give us some some direction as to how we arrived at that at number two. As a as a floor or as a max. Was that an arbitrary number or.\nSpeaker 2: It's not a legally required number to that. To that extent, it may be somewhat arbitrary, but I'm guessing, and I don't think any of us can quite recall where it came from, we probably lifted it from another ordinance somewhere in the state that imposes a similar penalty for similar conduct, but I can't say for sure.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I'm supportive of the motion and I'm I'm a little a little ambivalent on on 2.3 the friendly but I. We'll be open to hear from the maker of the motion and my colleagues on that.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Councilwoman Zendaya's.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you, Councilwoman Allen and Councilwoman Sorrell, for bringing this very, very important item forward and for your leadership on this. I know it's been a long road to getting here, and I just want to make sure that I let everyone know how important you are to this process from both sides of the\nSpeaker 4: coin. I just want to tell you how much we appreciate you coming out here and voicing your opinions and speaking for your community. So especially on this very, very important item. Myself as a renter, I'm always looking out for for renters to be able to live in a safe and and clean and updated environment.\nSpeaker 4: So that's always going to be important to me as a renter. I absolutely support the item that Councilwoman Allen has brought forward. I think that Councilmember Warren said it right. This is option number four, kind of like. So I think that a combination of that is really good.\nSpeaker 4: Another thing that I have heard from a lot of my residents is that the need for maybe asking for friendly in extending the moratorium that we have right now until this ordinance is is complete. And I'm hoping that you might be able to consider that and hoping that this ordinance can come back in 60 days.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: I have to go to you because you're cute, Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 5: I guess my question is for Steph. I understand the idea of like a Google form, but one of the things that I think is really important is how are we going to notify landlords of the requirement to use the Google form?\nSpeaker 5: If no one knows, they need to do it.\nSpeaker 6: Sure. So we do have a productive relationship with the various apartment owners associations, whether that's the California Apartment Owners Association, Small Property Owners Association and others. So that would be the starting point, not the ending point, but that would be the starting point for communicating with landlords.\nSpeaker 6: And then those that have email addresses associated with their business license. We would also be providing them a notification in that way. So that would be the starting point. But we would find whatever additional ways we could communicate with them, barring substantial cost.\nSpeaker 5: What percentage of those that have business licenses have email addresses associated?\nSpeaker 6: I don't have that information.\nSpeaker 5: And then furthermore, to be a landlord in the city, you don't need to have a business license, if only if it's of a certain number of units or more. Is that accurate? So just so we're clear, a large percentage of landlords might not be notified.\nSpeaker 5: That's a concern if we want really good data. So I guess I would request that there's an option for a tenant to put in information that then we would be able to reach the landlord and get additional information so that if a landlord is unaware that a tenant could at least bring it to our attention, just give\nSpeaker 5: more complete data. But I recognize that that creates another set of challenges. Just some just some food for thought. I'm supportive of the item on the floor as it stands. I don't know that I could be open to the friendlies that have come before.\nSpeaker 5: I would love to pass something tonight with the support of the full council. I think Councilman Allen has done a considerable amount of work on this, and I think that the motion that she brought is very thoughtful and I would be supportive of that, and I hope that we get to see that on the floor as a\nSpeaker 5: final vote. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I'll add my comment before going back to Councilwoman Allen. We've come a long, long way. And I know that folks have come here advocating predominantly to positions position one or no action at all. And I just want to remind folks that, you know, it was a couple of years ago, you know, and I've been participating\nSpeaker 6: in council meetings since 2010, and I remember the downtown planning fight and all of those things. Long Beach is in a significantly different place where there was no relocation assistance. And I think Andrew mentioned going back to home for the holidays made significant progress.\nSpeaker 6: There won't be, based on the comments of the council, what you hear an option one is not feasible from a financial standpoint. The council is not ready to go there. And and I think it's important to note that there are what's been presented in front of us does offer significant advancement in terms of, you know, relocation assistance\nSpeaker 6: increased in terms of, you know, the the fine you know, we've talked about slumlords in the city. We've talked about it. There's a big distinct difference between big companies or small companies or slumlords or people who are just trying to be good landlords.\nSpeaker 6: And having that fine, I think, is a clear distinction. If you break the law, there is a penalty. And there are you know, there are good things that are here. So while it is not heading toward option number one, I think what Councilwoman Allen is presenting, I think it's balance and will continue the conversation.\nSpeaker 6: And those are my thoughts. I see the city attorney is keyed up.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Thank you. Vice Mayor, just before it goes back to Councilmember Allen, there's a couple of questions that.\nSpeaker 6: She had asked a long time ago now that I want to close the loop on.\nSpeaker 2: The first is actually first is something that councilmembers and day has just said. I think it was a friendly to extend the prohibition on evictions until we get some final action on these changes.\nSpeaker 6: That's always been my intention. And in fact, that I.\nSpeaker 2: Brought back this extension on the prohibition, you know, without any specific direction from council to do so. Because I thought in July it was pretty clear that the intention of the council was put a moratorium on evictions until we.\nSpeaker 6: Take final action. So for all the members of the audience and behind the dais, there's been a lot of confusion about that. And I apologize for the role I played. February 28th is an arbitrary date. If we can't get something done by February.\nSpeaker 2: 28th, it's my full intention to bring back an extension.\nSpeaker 6: But February 28th, I think, gives us plenty of time to get something done. And it looks like consensus is building right now. So I intend to bring something.\nSpeaker 2: Back for formal adoption by you all behind the dais well in advance of that date. And at the same time.\nSpeaker 6: I would bring back something then.\nSpeaker 2: Terminating the prohibition on evictions if you take final action at the same time. They're meant to go at the same time, if that makes sense. And then in response to Councilmember Allen's questions regarding relocation payments currently currently the Long Beach Municipal Code requires the relocation payment to be made 15 days no later than 15 days after the\nSpeaker 2: notice of tenancy termination is delivered, and it is required to be paid in full at that time. I think that's.\nSpeaker 6: Responsive to a responsive to a question you asked a while back. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Allen.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I just thank you, my colleagues, for. For all of your feedback. So that's great to hear that, um, that, that could be extended until we figure all of this out. The moratorium. I'm all about collecting data. And, and then with regards to Council member Austin's.\nSpeaker 0: Ask about 2.3. I think the $15,000 is I think we should have a have a. A number on that. I don't think that there should be no limit. And so I like to keep that as it is then.\nSpeaker 0: So it sounds like this is the big question is, is 2.1. So I'm hearing yes and no. And so I guess, councilman. Sorry, my ask would be, do you want to make a substitute motion? And we vote on that outside of this.\nSpeaker 0: But but I think that I'd like to keep my motion the way that it is. And then we can if we want to make a substitute motion outside of that and vote, then I'm okay with that, too.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. I like to make a substitute motion to at least have the report back on a year's worth of data.\nSpeaker 6: I think that was it. Exactly.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Yeah, that's exciting. Yes.\nSpeaker 6: And Counsel, just so we're all clear in terms of the report, that would be it. It would come slightly more than a year later because we would wait until the ordinance actually became effective and then an entire year of data was collected and then some.\nSpeaker 2: Amount of time to report back.\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\nSpeaker 6: I think so. So we're on the main motion with a number of the friendlies accepted. So do we need to restate that or can we go to the vote? I'm clear on what it is, but maybe we should restate.\nSpeaker 2: Sure. When you said a number of friendlies. Except that I only have that there's one or maybe two. So if you don't mind overstated, the motion on the floor is to adopt sub sections three, four and five from option two.\nSpeaker 2: To adopt options three or four or $500 for relocation payment or two months rent, whichever is greater. Report back staff is to report back in a little over a year with the first year's worth of data. And then the last would be direction for me to bring back an extension of the moratorium if necessary, so that it\nSpeaker 2: doesn't.\nSpeaker 6: Expire before you take final action. Right. Right on. Right. Members, please cast your vote. And I'm not queued up, so I need to say yes.\nSpeaker 0: As mayor, are you and I?\nSpeaker 6: I'm not sure that I.\nSpeaker 0: Motion is carried.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. The next item we have is 35.\nSpeaker 0: That item required two votes.\nSpeaker 6: Oh, two votes. So we need to do this again.\nSpeaker 2: Councilwoman Ellen. That's one price and councilman zero.\nSpeaker 0: Emotion is great.\nSpeaker 6: And trying to cue cue into my own here, taking some time. Okay, let's go to item 35.\n",

Final consideration of Council Bill 20 2-345 has been postponed to after the public hearing on Council Bill 20 2-352 this evening.

It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 20 2-352 is open. May we have the staff report, please?\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Council President Gilmore and good evening. Members of the City Council. My name is Lily Jones. I'm with CPD Planning Services and today I'll be presenting the Farnworth Area Plan Amendment. My presentation is about 10 to 15 minutes long, and I will briefly cover the existing 2019 adopted plan, followed by a quick reminder on what initiated\nSpeaker 7: the plan amendment. And then I will wrap up with the summary of the staff report. So some of you were part of the vote that adopted what was then the very first neighborhood plan amendment or the very first Neighborhood Planning Initiative, which was the part of these area plans back in June of 2019.\nSpeaker 7: The adoption went through a 24 month planning process, which I was heavily involved with as a part of program project management team. And between 2017 and 2019, Community Planning and Development worked closely with the far northeast community to put together a really comprehensive plan that provides great guidance from and below Gateway, Green Valley Ranch and the DIA\nSpeaker 7: neighborhoods. And this great plan will continue to serve the far northeast community for years to come. The framework of the plan, which was adopted in 2019, address land use in built form, mobility and quality of life and infrastructure.\nSpeaker 7: And as you recognize, these are three elements of the complete neighborhood as prescribed by or in the blueprint Denver. The original 2019 plan adoption went through 20 steering committee meetings, five public meetings, one design charrette, and over 50 participations and community events attended by CPD staff, including myself.\nSpeaker 7: But today we're presenting to you a focus area upon amendment to the, ironically, the far northeast corner of the neighborhood. And the boundary of the plan amendment was predefined by their large development review, which is bounded by the future 72nd Avenue to the North Himalaya street to the east, the existing High Point Boulevard to the south, and\nSpeaker 7: then Argonne Street here to the to the on the western edge. An amendment to the recently adopted plan was needed in order to accommodate the relocation of Pepsi Bottling plant from its current location on Pruyn Avenue to the DIA neighborhood.\nSpeaker 7: There are four main components that were addressed or rather amended in this plan. The first is that we amended the land use designation to the specific area which was previously identified as a community center. And a community center is a place type that is intended to support a variety of mixed uses but doesn't support light, industrial or\nSpeaker 7: manufacturing uses. Therefore, to support a use like Pepsi Bottling Company, this area had to change its place type designation to value manufacturing, as you see identified here and on the map in Violet. The reason we had previously identified this as a mixed use is that we have we had anticipated that a light rail stop, I'm just going\nSpeaker 7: to call it out right here at the intersection of 72nd and Avenue and Himalaya was going to be developed. But since the adoption of this plan, we've learned that there are no plans to develop the light rail in the next 20 years.\nSpeaker 7: And so a mixed use would be difficult to support here without this light red light rail station. I should also remind you that the dark diagonal lines that we see indicated on the map, that's just to show us that residential isn't allowed north of 64th Avenue due to the disease influence area overlay.\nSpeaker 7: And so the change in place type from a community center to valley manufacturing is also needed to support the rezoning which my colleague Scott Robinson will present after me. The second change in the plan amendment is the change that had to be heard to be made to the Mobility Network in this area.\nSpeaker 7: Roads and mobility networks are highly dependent on the land use designations. And so with the changes of land use. We we don't need as many roads to connect across this this portion of the. The third man component amended in this plan is the transformative project in the DA neighborhood.\nSpeaker 7: This was previously called out as a line station at 72nd and Himalaya Street. But again, as I've already mentioned, this is no longer within the horizon of this plan. We have amended the transformative project to be Employment Center north of 64th Avenue.\nSpeaker 7: I do want to point out that there's still some language here and actually all throughout the plan that support the light rail stop in this area in case anything changes. And lastly, there are additional red lines throughout the plant that speak to either design quality, mobility, placemaking aspects, community outreach or just specific to the development of new\nSpeaker 7: manufacturing or light industrial uses in the far northeast community. We also facilitated market analysis for this area, which reported to which reported that the greenfield sites north of 64th Avenue where residential is restricted due to the the airport overlay.\nSpeaker 7: What's what was shown is that what's appropriate is light, industrial and manufacturing growth in this area. So this report also pointed out that industrial jobs have significantly higher wages when compared to hospitality. And hospitality is what we have previously seen develop in this area.\nSpeaker 7: So with hospitality jobs paying on average 1260 per hour versus $30 per hour, which is what the industrial wages are paying. So the market analysis also reported that the hotel corridor will remain strong along Tower Road. But again, the greenfield sites on the western and eastern ends of tower would be more appropriate to support light, industrial or\nSpeaker 7: manufacturing uses. There are three main criteria there are laid out in our plan 2044 evaluating area plants and plant amendments, and they are to assure that an inclusive community process was used to develop the kind of amendment that the plan amendment is consistent with the vision, goals and strategies of the plan.\nSpeaker 7: And then the plan amendments demonstrates a long term view. The pre-planning for the amendment started late in the summer of 2021, and we had our first steering committee meeting in October of last year, followed by a public meeting in December.\nSpeaker 7: We had a second steering committee meeting in February and we also sent out multiple email blasts and put out to a two week public review draft. I have three slides that touch on the most common themes that we heard throughout the public outreach process.\nSpeaker 7: The forerunner of these community asks for a community engagement strategy. And so we added recommendations in the plan that speak to building and establishing partnerships not just with Pepsi, but with any future employment uses, especially when it comes to job recruitment in the community and providing scholarships for certificate training and professional development for the far northeast community\nSpeaker 7: . We've also heard the community ask for transit access to the new employment centers, and we've included language that support shuttle services, for example, that connect people from transit stops to employment centers. An exemplar could be of that could be a shuttle from the existing 61st and Pena Boulevard to the Pepsi facility.\nSpeaker 7: We've also heard the community feedback regarding anticipated truck traffic along town roads and the impact it will have on road maintenance in. Well, Tower Road was designed to accommodate freight and large volumes of traffic. We did language into the plan that speak to developing road maintenance for Tower Road.\nSpeaker 7: Pepsi has also expressed their commitment to changing their fleet to all electrical vehicles by 2030, which will mitigate noise and air pollution due to truck. Truck traffic. The community also expressed that they wanted to make sure that benefits that were integrated into the hypo in general development plan for this area were not lost in the amendment process\nSpeaker 7: . And we have language of the plan that supports that specific to this property as it regards to open space trail networks, bridges and roadway connections. And those are all being carried over in the GDP update. Finally, the staff finds that the Foreign Office Area Plan Amendment was developed through an inclusive public process.\nSpeaker 7: So in regards to plan consistency specific to the comprehensive plan 2014, the far Northeast Area Plan Amendment is consistent with 31 individual goals and 67 strategies covering the topics of affordable housing, international intentional growth and development, supporting culturally rich and inclusive communities.\nSpeaker 7: Multi-Modal connectivity. Parks and open space. Health and safety and economic vitality. With regards to Blueprint Denver, the Farnworth area plan amendments address 22 individual policies and 53 individual strategies that cover topics such as land use and build form.\nSpeaker 7: Housing and transportation. Mobility and quality of life. The Map amendment stayed consistent with the previously adopted plan, and changes to these maps were only made within the amendment boundary. Steph therefore finds that the far north these area upon amendment is consistent with the comprehensive plan 2040 as well as the blueprint Denver.\nSpeaker 7: Lastly, SAP finds that the far northeast area plan amendment was developed with a long term vision and view building on the originally adopted 2019 plan. And so upon conclusion of this analysis, staff recommends approval of the in area plan amendment with conditions that the document would be edited for clarity and correctness.\nSpeaker 7: And with that, I thank you for your time. Attention.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, Lily, for the staff report. And we have five individuals signed up to speak this evening. And our first speaker is Steve Lawrence. Joining us here in chambers. Oh, okay. I will. Mr. Lawrence is attending, but is declining to speak.\nSpeaker 2: And so we'll go ahead and move on. Martin Wallace, who's joining us via Zoom. Go ahead, please, Martin. You'll have to unmute yourself.\nSpeaker 0: I. Good evening.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. Go ahead, please. Martin. You can go ahead and start. All right. We're going to see if we can get. MARTIN, you're the only I think we've got one other virtual. We'll go ahead and see if we can get.\nSpeaker 2: Martin back in the queue. All right. Well, we're trying to get Martin. We'll go in chambers. John Bennett is. We're in the public comment portion. The public speaker portion. You'll have 3 minutes to speak, sir.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Members of the City Council. My name is John Benitez. I have the privilege of being a resident of the city in county of Denver with my wife for 42 years. I'm here today. To discuss. The impact of the decision you are about to make.\nSpeaker 6: And I'm hoping that I can draw your attention, your focus on the importance of it in relation to a building that is in the path of progress here at 6850 argon. Eight years ago, I formed a company called BD Omni.\nSpeaker 6: We purchased a building in 68, 50, 68, 60 and 68, 90 Garden Street. I was hoping to be able to show you where it is on this map. But we are at the intersection of Oregon Street and 69th Avenue.\nSpeaker 6: Right now that property by the Army leases all of its space to seven tenants, one of which is the Denver Public Schools. We have a full fledged high school called Legacy Options High School with 125 students. We have administrative staff, a cafeteria, a gymnasium, principal's office.\nSpeaker 6: It's a full fledged high school. We have a church. We have five other tenants that are in the buildings. There are three buildings. The Church and a TV production company are situated. In the property that is and there.\nSpeaker 6: Premises are about 50 feet, which is almost the length of this dais for the city council members. From 69th Avenue. What we've learned and why am I here? I'm here not to promote my property. I'm here because there has been a lack of information given to us concerning a very pivotal decision made by Dottie.\nSpeaker 6: And I understand the accolades and I support them with respect to what Dotty has done for the city and county of Denver. What a decision that was made and indicates that the primary ingress and egress for 300 to 400.\nSpeaker 6: To up to I have read 900 tractor trailer trucks will be going past our building within 55 feet of it every day. Every day to go to the Pepsi Bottling plant. The Pepsi Bottling plant. Let's be clear about it is a 1.2 million square foot facility that will grow to 1.7 million.\nSpeaker 6: It'll start with 500 employees, which is terrific. They purportedly will come in from a different angle, but we will have 300 to 400 to 900 trucks a day.\nSpeaker 2: We have a lot of speakers. Everybody gets 3 minutes. And so we're going to go ahead and transition to the next speaker. Thank you for being here. And folks can ask you to come up for any questions that they might have.\nSpeaker 2: Next, we're going to Jesse Perez online.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Members of council may be.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Oh, good evening. My name is Justice for Black Star Action, Movement for Self Defense, Positive Action, Comment for Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado, the East Denver Residents Council, front line Black News. And I'll be the next mayor of Denver in 2023.\nSpeaker 3: And I live in District eight. And Councilman Hern, this district I'm in favor of this amendment to the far northeast plan for the green bill, a greenfield site to accommodate market demand since the plan's adoption. My question is, what exactly is going to be put here?\nSpeaker 3: I keep hearing it's either going to be a Pepsi facility or a community center. If someone please answer that question, I would greatly appreciate it. It meets. The three criteria consistency with the Northeast Denver plan consistency with Blueprint Denver and the long term view.\nSpeaker 3: Or efficient. So I'm in favor of the three amendments excuse me, to the Far East or Northeast plan. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Our next speaker is Brian Conley.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, Madam President, and members of Council. My name is Brian Connolly. I am with the firm of Otten, Johnson, Robinson, Neff and Ragan Eddy here in Denver. And I have the privilege of representing PepsiCo Beverages North America on the two matters that are before you this evening.\nSpeaker 1: As Lilly explained also, I should thank Lilly. She's done an excellent job of processing this area. Plant Amendment. As Lilly explained through the large development review process, we received feedback that an area plan amendment would be required, and we submitted a letter on March 9th of this year before the Planning Board hearing explaining our position in support\nSpeaker 1: of this area plant amendment. That's before you this evening. I would like to take this time to just mention three things, which I think underline Pepsi's support of the area plant amendment and why we think it's important to the city.\nSpeaker 1: First, manufacturing is really important to our community. We need to support its continued development. Manufacturing offers good paying jobs to people across the income spectrum, and economists have long agreed that communities that have manufacturing jobs have less income stratification and provide more upward mobility for residents.\nSpeaker 1: Denver has been losing manufacturing space and has lost manufacturing jobs as a share of our total employment for many years. And that's in part because we've set aside fairly little plant, little room in our plans for these types of uses, but the demand for them is high.\nSpeaker 1: This amendment and the Pepsi project that this will support presents an opportunity for our entire community to add manufacturing employment here in the city and for our city to become a model for sustainable advanced manufacturing. And on a related point, second point, this plant amendment will support significant developments in sustainability and technology.\nSpeaker 1: Pepsi's proposed bottling facility is intended to be industry, leading both in its sustainability and its technology. On the sustainability front, the company is anticipating the use of solar energy to power the plant with a goal of the entire facility being net zero.\nSpeaker 1: It is anticipating electrification of the company's truck fleet in the hopefully relatively near future and using the most advanced technology for wastewater recovery and recycling in the entire industry and the technology front. The plant will feature automated storage and retrieval systems, automated guided vehicles and advanced diagnostics and beverage manufacturing.\nSpeaker 1: The third thing is that this has great has several community benefits for the far northeast community. Pepsi looks at community benefits through four major ways workforce development, educational partnerships, community partnerships, and infrastructure improvements and workforce. This project will provide community members with access to jobs and training.\nSpeaker 1: On the educational side, Pepsi is looking at partnerships with local high schools and community colleges to encourage building technical skills and the community side. Pepsi will continue with strong philanthropic support of community organizations citywide as well as in the far northeast area.\nSpeaker 1: And our infrastructure improvements will include streets and parks and recreational facilities for community use. So with that, we do encourage you to support this a plan amendment. We'll be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. We're going to go ahead and try to get Martin Wallace back in the queue, our final speaker for this public hearing. And I see you're unmuted. Martin, go ahead, please.\nSpeaker 0: I am.\nSpeaker 3: And sincere apologies. We have storms in New York.\nSpeaker 1: So happy to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Wonderful. Thank you. All right. That concludes our speakers for this hearing. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 358. CNN. I knew as soon as I saw that. Councilmember Flynn. Go ahead, please.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Madam President. It was taking a while after clicking the button for it to appear. The gentleman from the church. Mr. Benitez. Could you come up? I don't get out there very often. So I'm relying on Google which.\nSpeaker 6: Maybe isn't the best thing on the planet, but it appears that the church is like a commercial warehouse structure or some kind of a light industrial structure is. Are there plans to build a church structure somewhere nearby? Is this a temporary home for the church?\nSpeaker 6: To my knowledge, no. It's not a temporary home. They are an active church that I built out. It looks like a warehouse, but it honestly is a church on the inside. Similarly, it looks like a warehouse with respect to the high school.\nSpeaker 6: It looks like a warehouse. But when you walk inside, it is. A high school. Okay. So is this. This will be then the permanent home for Saint Gianna Beretta, Molla Parish. It is to my knowledge that they have signed a long term lease with me.\nSpeaker 6: Yes. And they are there and they're active, not just on Sundays at seven days a week. Okay. Generally speaking, the. Is this an archdiocesan church? Yes, it is. It's affiliated with the Denver Archdiocese. Yes, it is. It's not one of those sort of breakaway Pius the 10th.\nSpeaker 6: No. The lease is actually referenced in the Archdiocese of Denver for the benefit of. Okay. That's okay. Because generally the archdiocese owns the real estate where it's churches are built. So I'm just curious. That's why I was finding it hard to believe that this was the permanent location in many ways to sell this to the archdiocese.\nSpeaker 6: No plans right now. They lease part of one of the buildings, and they're a great tenant. Mm hmm. And part of why I'm here is because the 300 to 400 to 900 trucks are going to go within 55 feet of their back door.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thank you. Was that basically the the tenor of the remainder of your remarks that you were not able to make? I appreciate you asking that question because no, I actually had other remarks to make, and I'd be glad to supplement, if I may.\nSpeaker 6: Madam Chairman. Madam President, can I ask him that?\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you for allowing me to do this. God forbid I should not panic. I say, God forbid. I should not. The reason that I'm suggesting that the council consider this issue of whether or not. This area plan amendment should be approved is for the simple reason that there was a decision made.\nSpeaker 6: There were options in front of the Department of Transportation, also in front of Pepsi Bottling Company, as to where all of these trucks and how they should go into and out of their facility. A decision not easy to make, but there were three options 69th Avenue, which abuts my property.\nSpeaker 6: 70th just north of it. And 71st. Just north of that. The decision ultimately made, to the best of my knowledge, after participating in the process and I filed objections or I filed our comments just as Pepsi did for the Denver Planning Board.\nSpeaker 6: But the decision was ultimately made without, to my knowledge, taken into consideration whether there was an impact on our building or on the hotels that are on 69th Avenue, those properties and the guests in those properties. There's going to be a lot of traffic no one has requested.\nSpeaker 6: We're asked whether or not this would impact our property at all. I have filed comments saying it will impact our property somewhere within the Department of Transportation, perhaps CPD. It's hard to say where the ultimate decision finally was made, but it was made to do it on 69th Avenue, which will severely impact the operations of my property\nSpeaker 6: . If the decision had been made after the city and county of Denver through its departments had actually. Gone in and understood. Is this going to impact you? Tell us what it will do. Having all these trucks every day.\nSpeaker 6: It's not just a NIMBY thing. It's this is what's going to impact our property. And I have 125 high school students and our high school. That are right there in DPS. I talked to them today. They are considering possibly expanding.\nSpeaker 6: There's a lot going on. But my point for the council to consider is that as this decision was made, it was made, I would characterize in a vacuum without having those of us, whether it's in an industrial site, whether it's a hotel, really talked to and allowed to voice their concerns.\nSpeaker 6: To me, it didn't happen. I wished it had. If the decision had been made, once that knowledge was shared, then I would accept the decision. I don't think it's there. I just do not think that process was undertaken.\nSpeaker 6: One of the things that I and I'm going to just say this is I truly, sincerely believe it. After 42 years here, many, many, many years that I've lived here, I have been thankful and very proud of this city and the state, quite frankly, of the decisions that we have made as a city and as a state\nSpeaker 6: . And what I'm challenging this city council is please. Please use best practices. Let us make the best decisions we can. We are smart. We can come up with solutions to issues and but let's hear people out and understand truly what impacts are.\nSpeaker 6: So I really appreciate the open question. Thank you. Thank you. That's all. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, Mr. Barnabas and Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Sawyer.\nSpeaker 7: Thanks, Madam President. Just had a couple of, I guess, quick clarifying questions for CPD. So we haven't approved the amend the amendment yet and we haven't approved the rezoning yet. So those things have to happen legally speaking, before a site plan happens.\nSpeaker 7: Can we? In which case things like locations in and out.\nSpeaker 0: Of.\nSpeaker 7: And access to for trucks.\nSpeaker 0: Would.\nSpeaker 7: Be made. So I'm just a little confused about kind of where we are in the process in the background.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, sir. My name is Steven Wilson. I'm with Community Planning and Development and in the large development review group. So I have worked with the applicant team and the different divisions in the city since the beginning of 2021 on this project.\nSpeaker 0: And to specifically answer your question, so there's a general development plan amendment and that has not yet been approved. That general development plan was presented to the Planning Board for feedback, and then the ultimate approval authority is the Development Review Committee.\nSpeaker 0: So you're correct that approval would be contingent on this evening's approval of the Area Plan Amendment and the rezoning.\nSpeaker 7: Okay, great. So, so the reason I ask that is because then that would suggest that there is still potentially time to, you know, discuss other options.\nSpeaker 0: Or.\nSpeaker 2: Consider.\nSpeaker 7: Impacts to surrounding businesses that maybe were unanticipated.\nSpeaker 0: That is correct. And if I may, I could give a little bit of background to that right now. So, again, thank you for the opportunity. So in the process of evaluating, there are actually four potential options at 69, 70, near 71st and 72nd.\nSpeaker 0: And through a process with Dottie community planning, development and the applicant in their plan, it was determined that 69th was the best option for safety reasons, that there is a streetlight already planned for 69. It allows for connections to the east.\nSpeaker 0: It allows for stacking of vehicles. And it again, it was overall the safest connection that we could do for the project based on the context. And to Mr. Benitez's point, there will be impacts to adjacent properties, but each of those other options has adjacent properties as well.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. And I think you mentioned, Brian, maybe you mentioned electrification of the the fleet. So. That could mean a lot of different things. Does that mean, then, that Pepsi's fleet will.\nSpeaker 0: Be quieter.\nSpeaker 7: And less impactful on the environment as a whole because they're electric? I mean, I used to have an electric car and people used to walk out in front of me all the time because they couldn't hear me coming.\nSpeaker 7: So I can attest to that. But I just wanted to kind of walk through that.\nSpeaker 1: I actually had a law school professor almost ran over me with an electric budget.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, it's a thing.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. So if the if if the cab, you know, if you're an electric cab on the front of a truck, it's not going to have all the diesel noise that would come with a usual truck cab. There's still maybe noise from braking.\nSpeaker 1: There may still be, you know, noises associated with, you know, tire tires running along the pavement. But it would it would be quieter than a diesel cab.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. I really appreciate that. And I think that covers all my question. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Sawyer. Councilwoman Black.\nSpeaker 7: I'm just going to further clarify what Councilman Sawyer said. Whoa.\nSpeaker 8: Lily.\nSpeaker 7: By approving this amendment to the plan, are we approving that 69th Avenue will be the road that is accessed by the Pepsi trucks? So the the plan isn't the right tool for whether the 69th or 71st. In fact, the plan as you can.\nSpeaker 7: Well, I don't I can't share the screen now, but if I could, you'll see that the the deck there's no actual language in the plan that says 69th versus 71st or anything like that. It is graphical, it is diagrammatic in terms of sheer the potential connections that we can have.\nSpeaker 7: And then there's a legend there that's attached that says, you know what, one is a priority versus another one is as a second option. And so we facilitated that. There's a69 connection, and we also have an arrow that shows 71st connection as a potential potential network.\nSpeaker 7: So the. To to answer. You know, in order for this plan to be approved or in order for zoning rezoning to be approved, the plan is to be approved. But then it would kick in the GDP approval as well.\nSpeaker 7: Right. But by approving the plan amendment tonight, we are not approving the GDP. No, you're not. I just wanted to be clear on that.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilmember Black. Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to ask how many lanes are anticipated on 69th Avenue? Is it anticipated to be widened from what it is today? Would. How many lanes are there right now?\nSpeaker 0: Again. Stephen Wilson, thank you for the question. So although I'm not an engineer, I think I have the answer to your question, which is that right away would ultimately support four lanes. To start with, I believe it will be two lanes with turn lanes that go with that.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And that's a planner answering him or engineering questions.\nSpeaker 2: And how does that differ from 56th Avenue that runs in front of or is this GBR in front of the B Dennis campus? I believe it's 56th Avenue that runs in front of the Sandoval campus as well, which has a significant amount more of students in both of those campuses.\nSpeaker 2: Are you familiar with the the width of the roads in front of those two high schools?\nSpeaker 0: I apologize. I'm not.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Councilwoman Gilmore, could you answer that question? So could you please your question again? I'm just asking, how many lanes of traffic are on 56th Avenue and is it GBR or 56 that runs in front of every Dennis campus?\nSpeaker 2: So it's Green Valley Ranch Boulevard runs perpendicular to every great Dennis campus. Telluride runs in front of it. But 15/6 Avenue is currently I mean, it's ultimately planned for six lanes, but we are getting an additional two lanes on 56th Avenue from Pena all the way to Peoria.\nSpeaker 2: So really the Montebello side in Green Valley Ranch, it's more so built out for the six lanes already on 56th Avenue. Okay. And that one is the one that runs parallel to the Sandoval campus. Right. Which has middle school and high school.\nSpeaker 2: Correct. I just wanted to sort of make that distinction between those locations, which I do know, on 56th Avenue between Pena Boulevard and Quebec Street, actually all the way down to I-25. As you go to the west, there's a lot of heavy truck traffic that travels on that particular corridor.\nSpeaker 2: That's normally the route I take when I come from the airport. So I don't have to, you know, sit with me. But I just wanted to point that out because I. Insensitive to Mr. Benitez's concerns. But as we have seen this part of our city grow, we have had to figure out how to address moving people back\nSpeaker 2: and forth, and particularly where we have some of the industrial businesses that happen to exist out in this area. So I think those are the only questions I had. So appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to go ahead and pose a couple of my questions and then we'll bring Councilman Flynn back into the queue. Lily. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. So when we had brought folks together for the far northeast area plan, we had great representation by both community organizations and residents in Green Valley Ranch\nSpeaker 2: . We got folks in Parkfield, High Point and Montebello. And could you talk a little bit about how we reconvened those steering committee members? Yeah.\nSpeaker 7: So we we had a fantastic steering committee that was really engaged in the original 2019 adoption process. And so we reached out to them again and we pulled community members from each one of those areas and asked them to rejoin.\nSpeaker 7: So we weren't starting that process from scratch. It wasn't people who, in terms of steering committee members who weren't involved in that in the original plan since this was so recently adopted, it felt like we just came back together and got back to work and really concentrated on the small area.\nSpeaker 7: So it was a really great process.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you. And how many meetings? I know you talked about that. We had our kickoff meeting in October of last year. And could you talk a little bit about the attendance by committee, by steering committee members? And then we also had some wide scale public meetings as well.\nSpeaker 2: Could you talk a little bit more about the the participation and the conversation of folks?\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, well, certainly, given the fact that we are in a pandemic right now, the public meeting structure, which was previously done in in the Foreign Office, communities, community centers, high schools, and, you know, in a place where people really felt comfortable right.\nSpeaker 7: As part of their community, we this time around, we were meeting online. Right. And that was a completely different experience. We didn't get to connect in the same way in with the steering committee. We met twice. We exchanged a lot of emails back and forth, and one of the ways that I convinced everybody to come back together\nSpeaker 7: is I promised that I wasn't going to exhaust them with a lot of steering committee meetings. And so they were really engaged. They were really present. And then with the I think on average, we would get about 45 people showing up online.\nSpeaker 7: Again, that's that could be said, that's a lot in a COVID environment to an online participation, especially for an area that's, you know, there's no permanent residential community here. So it's all greenfields.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you. And in those meetings with the community, I know a lot of times we talked about, you know, having a specific idea of what the truck routine would be so that there was consistency for community members.\nSpeaker 2: And so we talked about the free traffic scholarships and educational support that the community would want. Could you also talk a little bit about the workforce development and what was important to the community through having a large scale employer literally in the back yard, back yard or front yard of District 11?\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, we and that's one of the things that we reached out to the or we use the market analysis that we facilitated. Right. We weren't just thinking as we developed this with, with the community, but we weren't just thinking of Pepsi as the sole user like this.\nSpeaker 7: We anticipate similar type of in light industrial users like that facilitating. I wish I could pull the map up again because if you remember, it's hotel row along tower and greenfield sites all along. And so there's a lot of language that we included into the plan that spoke to building those partnerships, specifically with these kind of employment\nSpeaker 7: centers that are coming in, incorporating partnerships and creating neighborhood agreements that would foster those kind of, you know, relationships that we would we could anticipate the scholarships, we could anticipate job training. We could anticipate employing people from the community.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate that, Lily, and your leadership through this process. And I would like to invite Mr. Benitez up for a couple of questions, please. Hello. Thank you for being here, sir. If you wouldn't mind what I.\nSpeaker 2: If I recalling which of the steering committee, the community meetings. Were you able to attend?\nSpeaker 6: I attended the February 24th of this year. Community meeting. Yes, I did. I attended and spoke at the Denver Planning Board. Hearing that consider this issue and we submitted comments to that. So, yes, I did do that.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Thank you. So you were at one of the meetings and then you attended the planning board. From the the conversation with your high school, how long has the high school been located in this facility?\nSpeaker 6: They've been there approximately five years and they have about another four or five left. Okay. With renewals that are available.\nSpeaker 2: Great. And I know that in one of the meetings, we had talked quite extensively about the educational and also employment and career options that this might pose for students at your high school. And it sounded like from that meeting that it was something that you might be interested in pursuing, knowing that this far Northeast Amendment is separate\nSpeaker 2: from the rezoning hearing that we'll have after this.\nSpeaker 6: Great point. Let me let me add a comment. The company that owns this real estate. It's a small, limited liability company. We have seven members. We do not we do not object to the development that Pepsi wants to do.\nSpeaker 6: We're strong supporters of that. The objection that we have goes to one thing, and it is a decision that was made, and I don't know whether that decision was communicated during the other public hearings that Lilly described and perhaps you were referring to back in 21.\nSpeaker 6: And whether the attendees of those hearings truly understood there's going to be 300 to 400 to 600 to 900 trucks going on this particular street, because for the members of the council, there was a mobility study completed December 15th of last year.\nSpeaker 6: And that mobility study focused on 71st Avenue as the way to get the trucks in and out. And that mobility study concluded that that was the best route in and it did not address. 69th Avenue and decide the 69th was the best way in.\nSpeaker 6: That decision was made sometime in January or February or March this year. And it was made and I wonder whether that decision was truly communicated to members of the public particularly. The company I'm referring to be the Army.\nSpeaker 6: The hotels on 69th Avenue truly today understand that there's going to be this much traffic going by their hotels. And I question whether that that was truly made clear or not. So we do not object to the development.\nSpeaker 6: And should we support it? We support the jobs.\nSpeaker 2: Great, great. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. And then I don't know if this question is perhaps for Lilly, because when we were working with the community members, they did want something documented around.\nSpeaker 0: A.\nSpeaker 2: Truck reading agreement. And so the council office had worked closely before this rezoning was filed. That's right. To negotiate and to work with an adjacent property owner to assure that, because that was the recommendation from the members of the steering committee and community members, that they wanted a bit more reliability on removing trucks from Tower Road and\nSpeaker 2: actually rerouting those trucks onto Panya Boulevard more. So is that accurate?\nSpeaker 7: That's correct, yeah. So the good neighborhood agreement and the reason I didn't bring it up because these are usually not tied to the plan, the plans themselves, they're associate usually with the rezoning, which my my colleague Scott was going to refer to.\nSpeaker 7: But Brian, do you want to speak to the development agreement?\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you. And Brian, if you could, go ahead and introduce yourself for the record.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Brian Connolly, again, I'm representing Pepsi Bottling Company, North America. So the agreement that you're referencing, Council President Gilmore, is a it's a truck routing agreement between Pepsi and the surrounding master association that controls all of High Point the development out there, because those are the most affected owners.\nSpeaker 1: Those are the ones that would be affected by truck routing and through the course of conversations. So so I want to just take one step back, which is the community meetings on this project actually started with the large development review process.\nSpeaker 1: So the community meetings actually started before the far Northeast Area Plan Amendment even was was discussed or came about. It started before the rezoning was was the application was filed. And in those community meetings we, we were required to notice properties all around the subject property.\nSpeaker 1: And so those notices went out to the entire hotel community up and down Tower Road. There were hotel owners that actually attended even that first community meeting on the large development review process. And one thing that we consistently heard was we don't want truck traffic going into the residential areas that are south of this property.\nSpeaker 1: As Lily mentioned, there is residential south of 64th Avenue. And so I think the feedback that we received from Green Valley Ranch, from Monticello, from people who live in the community, was we don't want truck traffic in our residential areas.\nSpeaker 1: Obviously, truck traffic in residential areas is also bad for Pepsi because that's certainly the slowest path by which you can transport goods out of the the proposed plant. So in working with the community immediately around this property, we we developed a truck routing agreement which provides for trucks to be routed west out of the facility to Tower\nSpeaker 1: Road, where they will then access Pena Boulevard and would actually then likely go on to E for 70. So so even keeping them sort of out of central Denver to the extent they're going westbound. So that's what the truck routing agreement provides and it's a binding contractual commitment.\nSpeaker 1: I would also just add the truck traffic piece. I would also just make one more clarifying point because I want to make sure we're operating on a consistent set of facts. There is no plan to have 900 trucks a day with this facility.\nSpeaker 1: This facility, as we've said consistently throughout the process, is anticipated when it when it opens to have approximately 12 trucks an hour, which comes out to about 280, 290 trucks per day. That number certainly could increase as production increases, but there is really no way that there would ever be 900 trucks a day.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm not really sure where Mr. Benitez got that information.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate that. All right. That wraps up my questions for now. And we'll go it looks like Councilman Flynn, you're up next.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Madam President. You stole my thunder with the truck routing agreement. I was wanting to go into the background of why that was. That's not a city requirement. Lilly Correct. The truck routing agreement is in our packet and I was reading through it and I was just curious why 69th Avenue was chosen.\nSpeaker 6: I guess the city is not part of that, is it? Because it's between the High Point Master Association and Bottling Group?\nSpeaker 7: I'm not sure if I'm following your question.\nSpeaker 6: Does the did the city. Did we ask Pepsi and the.\nSpeaker 7: Joint.\nSpeaker 6: Master Association to come up with this truck routing agreement? We are not a party to it.\nSpeaker 7: That's right.\nSpeaker 6: So do we have anything to do with the do we ask for it?\nSpeaker 7: Well, we suggested that that might be the route to take. When we heard the the feedback from the community during planning meetings.\nSpeaker 6: Obviously we're not insisting on. No. Well.\nSpeaker 7: Or is this a disgusting thing?\nSpeaker 6: Brian, could you could you respond? I'm just really curious, because when Mr. Benedetti was talking about 71st Avenue, 71st Avenue was two blocks closer to Pioneer Boulevard, and it would mean two fewer blocks. My wife is not listening, so she can't correct my grammar.\nSpeaker 6: I think it's two fewer blocks traveling on Tower Road. Why? Why was 71st Avenue not chosen for this? I mean, because it goes right into the ACM High Point site.\nSpeaker 1: That it does actually. So 71st Avenue was the access point to the site that was initially proposed by Pepsi. Right. So if you can and again, if if we had the map up, it would be helpful. But if you can envision the geography out there, 71st Avenue and Oregon meet each other at what is essentially an L\nSpeaker 1: intersection. So 71st Avenue ends at Argonne right now. Right. The original proposal from Pepsi was to just extend 71st Avenue into the site that Pepsi is purchasing.\nSpeaker 3: Right.\nSpeaker 1: And feedback that we received from Dottie, we actually heard a few pieces of feedback from Dottie, which I think are important to this analysis. The first is that if if 71st were extended into the Pepsi site, you'd have a dead end street.\nSpeaker 1: We don't usually do dead end streets in Denver. It complicates things like snow removal and street maintenance and whatnot. Secondly, Dottie wanted a through connection to the East to improve connectivity in the area and so 69th allows for that.\nSpeaker 1: If you if you had 71st be that through connection through that property, you would you would basically preclude the construction of a manufacturing plant because it would be right in the middle of the property. The third reason that Dottie was concerned about that approach is that 71st Avenue, if it were used as the access point to the\nSpeaker 1: plant, it would result in trucks stacking or backing up westward from the plant entrance, which I mean, again, it's sort of anticipated that there would be 12 trucks an hour, a truck every five or 6 minutes. But if you had a stacking situation, the trucks might actually back up to the Tower Road intersection.\nSpeaker 1: The 69th Avenue alignment allows for a thru connection from High Point Boulevard over to Tower Road. It then also allows for what will ultimately be a long North-South driveway from 69th Avenue into the Pepsi facility so that you really don't run the risk of trucks stacking or backing up out under the public streets.\nSpeaker 1: Any of that stacking would occur internal to the property. And then the final reason, the fourth reason that Dottie, as I understand it, rejected the 71st Avenue proposal is that 71st Avenue, there is not enough stacking room for trucks that would be turning left off of Tower Road onto 74.\nSpeaker 1: So if you can imagine driving south from Panya Boulevard into where the hotel district is, you've got left hand turn lanes. There would not be enough room for trucks to to back up sort of backward north from 71st.\nSpeaker 1: And that would then impact the bridge that the bridge overpass where the line goes over Tower Road 69th Avenue, again allows for that through connectivity. It avoids the stacking issues. It will be a signalized intersection at Tower Road.\nSpeaker 1: And I'd also just point out that as part of the GDP amendment process, there is discussion about the applicant actually making transportation improvements to the intersections at 69th and Argonne, as well as at 69th and Tower Road to improve safety.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thank you. At. I guess I'm looking at the subdivision map and I. I just don't see I guess I don't see the sense of that. The 71st 69th Avenue being a thru route. Are we? We're going to punch it through to Aurora.\nSpeaker 6: Because it connects to High Point Boulevard at the Aurora city line. It would be no longer or shorter than 71st. So I'm a little befuddled. The left turn stacking cutout on Tower Road, it looks to be the same length turning left from tower to 71st as it is tower to 69th.\nSpeaker 6: So I guess I'm a little befuddled in the long run that this is not something that I would base, you know, a decision on. It's a it's an agreement between two private parties. It's not involving the city. But I just find befuddled by.\nSpeaker 6: So if you can shed light on it. Really, that's great. If not, we should move on.\nSpeaker 7: I just. Is there an option to share the screen? Again. Thank you so much. I just want to clarify to what Brian was speaking to. Here's the 69th Avenue connection. And these were really I mean, we spent hours and hours and hours with daddy trying to understand how to move traffic along here.\nSpeaker 7: Obviously, I'm not a traffic engineer either. I'm a planner. And so I'm going to do my best to explain and reiterate what Brian, which was speaking to you. But essentially what you get on 71st Avenue is a private roadway, right?\nSpeaker 7: That's just servicing Pepsi and Daddy's priority. One of their priorities was to make that through connection, that it wasn't going to be just in and out. But there was an opportunity to navigate traffic, not only for Pepsi to use, but for to connect across to what potentially would be 71st Avenue or 70 I'm sorry, 73rd Avenue across\nSpeaker 7: into Adams County as well. And then the intersection here, this is where Brian was speaking to you. The way that the the trucks lining up as they're coming down, pioneer would just cause too much of a congestion here and the ability to to make those left turns versus the ability to take a left turns here.\nSpeaker 7: And then again, as Steven Wilson mentioned, there's going to be a signaling that's going to be in place and that's already plan at 69. And that also created that as a priority over 71st. And lastly, the stacking of vehicles.\nSpeaker 7: This allows for the stacking vehicles, the length of that within Pepsi's property as they as they wrap as the trucks would wrap around here, which didn't didn't given just sort of the footprint and the layout of the building as proposed, which is very strict, as I as I learn, based on their operational needs, it wouldn't been a\nSpeaker 7: lot like they wouldn't have had enough room to do that on 71st.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I. I guess I'm still scratching my head 69th as I'm looking I'm looking at that on my screen here and 69 Wiggles and whines to High Point Boulevard and then it goes up. I know that's Dunkirk. And then over again on 70th and then up on Himalaya, seems to be 71st, goes right into the plant and\nSpeaker 6: that would be where you want the trucks to go rather than winding through 69th and High Point.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. And as Brian mentioned, that was that was our first and initial consideration. But it just no matter how much we tried it, it wasn't working. Okay, technically.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 2: Driven out there lately or had to go down Tower Road or once you get off Penn Yan Boulevard, it is a very short stretch of road and you could see very quickly how the trucks would start to stack up.\nSpeaker 2: That's right. Coming off and then impede traffic both on Tower Road. That's right in on Pena Boulevard as well, trying to get off on that off of that off ramp that definitely. I'm glad you're asking the questions. Councilmember Flynn.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember Ortega. Thanks, Ben and President Lilly, I wanted to ask a question about you had mentioned that. Pitney Boulevard was one of the preferred routes to take to sort of keep that traffic out of the neighborhood. Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 2: And I don't know if we have anybody here from the airport.\nSpeaker 7: But I think we do.\nSpeaker 2: I remember we are going through a process of adding additional lanes because of concerns that traffic that's not going to the airport. We actually had to pay some fines to FAA because that road was built with airport dollars.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm just wondering how we're encouraging people to use Pinners that are not airport traffic. Right. That would would be using that corridor to then, you know, come into this area. And I get we want to keep traffic out of neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 2: But at the same time, I don't want to make I don't want to create more planes for the airport either. So is there anyone that can speak to this issue?\nSpeaker 7: I think Brian or Jen.\nSpeaker 1: I will I will do my best to answer it. And if I do something incorrect, then somebody behind me is going to kick me. So. We had discussions with the airport about the use of Panya and about the funding question and improvements to Panya.\nSpeaker 1: Ultimately, how those discussions were resolved is that because of the planning process that the city is going through right now, it was not the appropriate time to decide whether or how Pepsi or any other property owner along Panya would contribute to resolving that situation.\nSpeaker 1: The reality is that Panya was built with interchanges that serve the properties around it, and it's a public highway. And so that, you know, in working with through the airport and the city attorney's office, it was determined that this was the best approach to take with both truck routing and with addressing the issues of hand.\nSpeaker 2: So I think this is something that warrants having some input from the airport attorneys to make sure that we're not putting the airport in a in a box, if you will, as we encourage more and more development out in this area.\nSpeaker 2: I know it has been anticipated that we have airport development, and it may be that, you know, if this facility is going to be shipping out product to other cities, other states, it may be somehow deemed as an airport related operation.\nSpeaker 2: So that's where I think having that clarity from our our city attorneys from the airport may be helpful because I know that we don't want to get in trouble with FAA as as we've seen in the past, where we had to pay fines.\nSpeaker 2: And I'll go ahead and unless Brian.\nSpeaker 1: You I was gonna say I mean I've spoken to airport attorneys about this I don't know if any member of the city attorney's office who's present here would like to weigh in on it.\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, I did. I mean, so I've had extensive conversations with Josh in the mayor's office about this, and I'm blanking on Josh's name. Lepley Yes. And so, you know, in talking with Josh right now, we have traffic on Penna that is not sitting in county related, it is not airport related, it is commerce traffic.\nSpeaker 2: We're not currently it's not a toll road. We're not restricting Adams County, Arapahoe County Commerce City, Aurora from utilizing Pena Boulevard. And I would hate to see us restrict a large scale workforce development employment center in the far north east by holding ourselves to a different standard than what the airport is currently holding other municipalities to.\nSpeaker 2: And that hasn't been a conversation, I believe, that long ago when we explored the conversation about a toll road, we knew that that was going to restrict growth in the far northeast, and that wasn't anything that the airport wanted to do either.\nSpeaker 2: And so the airport has been well aware of this process as it's been going through, you know, the different channels. Are they going to come forward and publicly say, yes, we want you to do that? No, they're not.\nSpeaker 2: They're going to stay silent on it. But unless you've got new information that that's where we had left the conversation, I don't have near.\nSpeaker 7: And for me, I've just been struggling with trying to figure out how to answer your question. And I know I should have an answer.\nSpeaker 5: I was the transportation commissioner that involved in the project office, but I don't have the specific correct answer to your question. The more general answer to the question is that application.\nSpeaker 7: Of user fees have been evaluated for Pepsi Center, as you know, in.\nSpeaker 5: The for the for Pena Boulevard in general.\nSpeaker 7: But there isn't going to be a move to apply user fees for one specific user. So there could in the future be.\nSpeaker 5: A reevaluation of whether there.\nSpeaker 7: Should be user fees for for Penn.\nSpeaker 5: Boulevard.\nSpeaker 7: For all commercial uses or for commercial uses of a particular type. But the airport is not going to institute.\nSpeaker 5: Specific restrictions for one specific user.\nSpeaker 0: I get.\nSpeaker 7: That. Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: But I guess as we continue to encourage more development on airport property. It appears as though this is something that we're going to need to figure out how to tackle as as we attract more and more commercial or industrial development.\nSpeaker 2: I'm I think this is a great project for our city. I think it's a great project for the far northeast area. But I think we we just have to be really clear that, you know, we've we've crossed all the T's and dot it all the I's.\nSpeaker 2: And Shannon, I understand you have that. Expertize that you bring to the table. Having worked with CDOT and being involved with a lot of our big projects that we have in the city. But I just know that in the past we've had to pay fines because people driving on the airport on Pioneer Boulevard that were not going\nSpeaker 2: to the airport, we got dinged for it. We the airport. And so I just hope there's some way as as we encourage more development out there, that I heard you very loud and clear that there would be fees attached to the project.\nSpeaker 2: Is it you made reference to fees.\nSpeaker 5: That there are.\nSpeaker 7: Not user fees currently for the use of any boulevard.\nSpeaker 5: That there could be a general.\nSpeaker 7: Reevaluation of that in the future?\nSpeaker 5: The Chip Projects Office.\nSpeaker 7: Actually has a regular check in meeting with the airport administration to talk about sort of all the issues about real estate development. I will put that on the agenda for our next meeting, just to ask if, you know, if they're considering.\nSpeaker 2: This.\nSpeaker 7: In the future.\nSpeaker 2: I guess the other question to ask is, as we're moving forward to add more lanes of traffic to Pioneer Boulevard that. As I understood it would otherwise accommodate. Traffic that is not going to the airport. How? You know, like, what's the timing of that?\nSpeaker 2: And then how do we see that getting us out from, you know, being fined by FAA? So anyway, that would be part of those conversations with the mayor's office. But I appreciate everyone attempting to answer my questions.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Sorry, I can't be more specific.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for those questions. And I hope we get to that point that we have more development in the far northeast, that we have to entertain some of those fees for the use of our roadways.\nSpeaker 2: That would be great. Not seen any other questions. The word we're within our meeting right now, sir, and the public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 352. I want to go ahead and I'll make my comments first about that.\nSpeaker 2: This is in the far northeast and this has been a long time coming. We had great community engagement with the Far Northeast plan when we went through that initial process. We reconvened the same community members because they were very well versed in what the far northeast area plan and the intent was.\nSpeaker 2: And we reconvened those co-chairs and they did a really great job of through Montebello 2020, through Montebello Organizing Committee, through Girls Trek, through Montebello, walks through the Green Valley Ranch Citizens Advisory Board, through a variety of civic minded and community based organizations, came together and really made recommendations that we held Pepsi to a high standard.\nSpeaker 2: We held the the potential use. We vetted all of the different options and talked through it with the community. And we wanted to be cognizant that we didn't want truck traffic going through the residential areas. Now, do schools change do churches change locations?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, they do. We know in Denver public schools that they're currently closing schools because they're not seeing the enrollment numbers that they used to have. And I would ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this far Northeast Amendment, because it will bring almost 500 high paying jobs to the district.\nSpeaker 2: And we have a plan in place to reduce the negative effects of that development in the community. And I would ask my colleagues to support this far northeast area plan amendment this evening. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22.\nSpeaker 2: Council members say to Barker, You're a little late on the queue, but go ahead and get your comments in, please.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. I am currently housing Pepsi in my district and currently live in a neighborhood surrounded by these job providers like Purina, Manna, Pro and Pepsi and Coke. And the list goes on of people or companies that we've sacrificed our communities to.\nSpeaker 7: This is it feels incomplete. It feels like we're prioritizing the business over. The bike impaired experience in these neighborhoods, the residential experience. I have a camera outside my home that captures how many semi-trucks go down my street. They're not allowed to go down.\nSpeaker 7: And every day I count hundreds of them. And so I'm very concerned about this and definitely don't think we have enough information about the agreements, about the stakeholders who are affected at the schools in this location. And so for tonight, I'll have to abstain, but wanted to make sure that I explained on record why I don't feel\nSpeaker 7: like this is complete and why I feel like there is potential harm or unintended consequences of not fully fleshing this out before we support it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman CdeBaca. And I'll go ahead and close out the comments. I'm going to tonight vote on my vote with my community and that there is no residential community of Denver residents in the area. And I'm carrying forward the will of the district 11 residents who fully vetted this process.\nSpeaker 2: Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22, Dash 352, please.\nSpeaker 5: Black. I set about to abstain. Clark.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 5: Flynn.\nSpeaker 6: I.\nSpeaker 0: Herndon, i.\nSpeaker 5: Hines.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 5: Cashman.\nSpeaker 3: All right.\nSpeaker 5: Kenny Ortega, I.\nSpeaker 7: Sawyer, I.\nSpeaker 5: Madam President.\nSpeaker 2: I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce the results.\nSpeaker 5: One Abstention in ten Eyes.\nSpeaker 2: Ten Eyes Council Bill 20 2-352 has passed. Councilmember Hines, will you please put Council Bill 20 to dash three, four or five on the floor for final passage and.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: All right. Thank you very much, staff. Thank you for your work and and for the presentations. Great to see you all. All right. We was pretty close to 3 minutes, maybe five between the two of them. So then we are now moving on to item 60 and we'll do a little shuffling of staff.\nSpeaker 0: Exit stage left, enter stage right. However you do that, maybe it's backwards. But while there are other exiting and entering. Madam Clerk, could you introduce this item?\nSpeaker 2: I like carrying. A public hearing to consider adoption of resolution of intent to prepare a housing element update for the period 2023 to 2031 that maximizes the use of city owned land at Alameda Point and shuttle terminals and rezoning certain sites and districts to permit multi-family housing in residential densities of at least 30 units per acre and\nSpeaker 2: consider impacts related to the city charter and consider directing staff to file an appeal of the city's regional housing needs allocation.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And joining us tonight, I think we have our planning bills and transportation director Andrew Thomas and Ms.. Selina Chen from the attorney's office. So we're ready for you anytime.\nSpeaker 1: Welcome tastic. Good evening. Mayor Ashcroft, members of city council. Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 2: All right.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, just fine.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Andrew Thomas. I'm your director of planning, building and Transportation. As you know, the city of Alameda is in the process of updating its housing element of the general plan, which is mandated by state law. The housing element update is a major effort and challenge for the Alameda Community Staff, the Planning Board and the City\nSpeaker 1: Council. Due to the size of our regional allocations, often referred to as the Rena. These challenges are immense and they will be citywide, and the consequences of failing to adopt our housing element will be equally immense and will be felt citywide as well.\nSpeaker 1: Those consequences are described in the staff report, so I will be able to answer any questions about those if needed. We believe to be successful in this effort, which will take us about a year. We'll need a coordinated effort between staff, the Alameda community, the planning board and the city council.\nSpeaker 1: And we will need our city council to lead our team effort through this year long planning process. Tonight, we are asking the city council to provide direction and confirmation on four specific questions. Number one, would you like staff to file an appeal of our arena allocation?\nSpeaker 1: As described in the staff report, staff does not believe an appeal will be successful, but staff will file the appeal that the Council would like us if you would like us to. However, the deadline is July 9th, so we need your direction tonight.\nSpeaker 1: And if you decide to appeal, we would like your direction on the arguments that you would like us to make on your behalf. Question number two Are we, as the city of Alameda, committed to adopting a housing element in compliance with state law?\nSpeaker 1: Question number three Are we, as a city of Alameda committed to adopting multifamily zoning as necessary to comply with state law as we have done for the last two successful housing element cycles in 2012 and then again in 2014.\nSpeaker 1: And fourth and finally, are we, as a city of Alameda committed to working to maximize, to the extent feasible, the use of vacant and underutilized city owned land to accommodate our regional housing need? Tonight, you have three alternative recommendations before you staff provided a recommendation not to appeal the arena, and we offered a draft resolution confirming questions\nSpeaker 1: to three and four in the affirmative. The planning board considered the resolution and the issue of the appeal, and they also recommended that you not appeal the arena. And they offered a draft resolution confirming items two, three and four in the affirmative.\nSpeaker 1: But their resolution removes conclusions regarding state law and preemption of Article 26 that are in the staff resolution. And then finally, we have you all received today an alternate resolution from Council member Herrera Spencer that recommends that the city council appeal the Reno.\nSpeaker 1: And confirms questions two, three and four in the affirmative. Her resolution also removes the language that the planning board removed from their resolution regarding Article 26 and City Charter. Excuse me, city charter. And her resolution adds an additional direction to staff to prioritize all efforts to eliminate the Navy's financial constraints designed to limit the number of units\nSpeaker 1: that we might be able to accommodate at Army Point, staff is willing and able to to move forward with the Council's direction and from staff prospective, any of the three alternative resolutions provided provide adequate direction at this time, in this process for us to be moving forward.\nSpeaker 1: With that, I am available to answer any questions you might have, and we look forward to your deliberations tonight. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for that succinct report. Mr. Thomas, Counsel Any clarifying questions for Mr. Thomas? Councilmember Knox White Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: And thanks to our staff here for the incredible amount of work that has gone into all of this on any of the resolutions, whether it's Councilmember Herb Spencer's resolution or the staff resolution, does the adopting.\nSpeaker 2: Of the.\nSpeaker 3: A plan to use EMF overlay zoning? Is that a policy that actually that actually carries weight or is it just a statement that in the future there is an expectation that the MF overlay will be used?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. What staff is saying is we know for sure that we are going to have to use that to comply with state law if the council. Does not wish us to pursue that strategy, which is the strategy we used in the last to the last two housing element cycles.\nSpeaker 1: We would like to know that now not we do not want to wait until a year from now to find that out from the city council because at that point, it will be too late to adjust. So from our perspective, we just trying to make sure that the Council understands and agrees that we should pursue the same\nSpeaker 1: the same approach as we did the last two cycles. Does that answer your question?\nSpeaker 3: It does. I'm not sure I see that being clearly outlined in the Council Member Spencer resolution, but that's okay. I can I can address that.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I. From from Shasta perspective in her resolution and the final bullet point I think her I don't have it directly right in front of me but something to the effect of we are going to adopt a housing element in compliance with state law and do the necessary zoning, multifamily zoning as necessary to comply with our arena\nSpeaker 1: . If I if I read it correctly.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Further clarifying questions, Counselor de Fog.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. On the third item of adopting multifamily zoning, we already have in place in our zoning, we have the multifamily overlay. So that's not a new zoning. It's not a new approach when it comes to trying to meet state obligations.\nSpeaker 1: Are we contemplating a new zoning code, new zoning category? Call it what you might, because my understanding is there's some contemplated, some sites that are currently zoned C two PD might be labeled a new zoning category. So is that what is meant by adopting multifamily zoning?\nSpeaker 1: It's. There's. The what? The same strategy as was used two years ago. But it would have to be applied to. To accommodate our our regional housing need. We're going to have to apply it to additional sites. So it's not a new zoning code, but it will be added to additional sites in Alameda.\nSpeaker 1: Whether you do it as a multifamily overlay or an adjustment to the C two, it's a very simple. You both achieve the same thing. It's removing the multifamily prohibition and allowing at least 30 units the acre, whether you do it by amending the zoning or whether you do it through a multifamily overlay.\nSpeaker 1: The effect and the input and the the result is the same. And we're we can do it either way that from staff prospective it doesn't it doesn't matter if the council has a preference. We're we're happy to do it either way.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Hey, for the clarifying questions. Okay. Madam Cook, do we have public speakers?\nSpeaker 2: You have three.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So if the number remains at three, you are to remind speakers how much they have.\nSpeaker 2: Well, we're up to five now, so if we. When we get to seven, there's six. Okay. Yes, we have seven now. So there is now 2 minutes per person instead of three. And the first speaker is Sophia DeWitt.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Welcome back, Speaker to.\nSpeaker 2: This is my item. Good evening. Council members and city staff as both a resident of the city of Alameda residing at 1581 of US two Avenue Apartment E and as a member of staff at East Bay housing organizations where I serve as program director.\nSpeaker 2: I'm coming to support the staff report on this item and urge that you prepare a resolution of intent to begin the housing element process consistent with what is stated in the staff report. We are pleased that Alameda, in the past two cycles for the housing element process, has submitted two previous conforming housing elements in both 2012 and\nSpeaker 2: 2014. And we were urged that you would do that again and so that you would do everything that would be required in order to submit a housing element that is consistent with state law, including using the multi-family overlay zones that you've used previously, and that you do the zoning changes where necessary to allow multi-family housing in places\nSpeaker 2: in the city where it might not have been allowed previously. We do believe that Article 26 is in conflict with state housing element law, and we would also urge you not to appeal the arena designation for the city of Alameda.\nSpeaker 2: We do not believe that that would be a successful appeal for the city and that the city and in addition, needs to meet its regional obligations along with other cities in the Bay Area. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Zach Boling.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, Speaker Boling.\nSpeaker 1: And their counsel. I made some comments on the planning board, but if I had to read some of my notes to council on this item, so I wanted to reiterate some of that a bit. One of those was related to as SFH requirements concerning the site inventory, excluding R one from the R to DA six of zoning\nSpeaker 1: . Some of those areas are high resource historically green zoned areas and red lighting maps and in some of the transit rich areas defined under state law. Look, it doesn't take a lawyer, but lawyers and powers councils have said that Article 26 conflicts with state law verbatim.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm in favor declaring such in our resolution. I also believe Mr. Thomas can correct me if I'm wrong. But if City has not responded to the city's request for comments on Made by Paul McDougal about the MF overlays and using those.\nSpeaker 1: It's a bit unique to see such huge MF worlds in my experience in reviewing and commenting on housing elements across the state. I know it's a weird hobby. Don't ask. I'm wondering why we can't up zoned underlining zoning and codes on some of that instead of having big overlays.\nSpeaker 1: I'm also concerned that that might create issues with the wording of some of the new FHA laws that that overlay might be questioned by each city. When we do our checklist, the proposal triggered by Councilmember Spencer mentions focusing most the area housing on an Alameda point, but I don't think that would meet FHA rules.\nSpeaker 1: If you look, I would ask maybe to review the video that Paul McDougald did a presentation on the requirements there. It would explain some of these issues in better detail than I could on arena appeals. They pretty much end up being a waste of time and staff resources.\nSpeaker 1: They very rarely see significant changes in arena count. I could be twisted my arm to not be against an appeal if we wanted just to get in writing all of these complaints that don't hold water to just put them to bed.\nSpeaker 1: And that's basically all I got to say in that amount of time, which is very hard. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank your next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Ellen Parsons.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, Speaker Parsons. Ready for us. We're ready for you.\nSpeaker 2: We could go to the next speaker and try coming back. Perhaps they just stepped away for a moment. Drew Abrams.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Good evening. Speaker Jerry Abrams.\nSpeaker 1: Hi. Good evening to Dara Abrams calling in this evening from Calhoun Street over on the East End. First, a thank you to city staff and also the planning board for working so diligently to thread the needle of Alameda next housing element.\nSpeaker 1: I'm calling in this evening to voice support for Alameda making a good faith effort to meet its RINA numbers. Much work is still needed to actually get to the finish line. So let me encourage city council to focus city staff's time on the work at hand, not waste resources on appealing the city's arena numbers to a bag\nSpeaker 1: of just a reminder, as I hope everyone knows, that there's really only one way to reduce Alameda Arena numbers and that's to force them onto another one of the Bay Area's 101 cities. So let's play our part on this housing.\nSpeaker 2: Opportunity site.\nSpeaker 3: Draft that's been prepared.\nSpeaker 1: It's it's fascinating to read. I wish it had pictures because it really does cover a lot of neighborhoods, a lot of densities. And it's kind of fascinating to think ahead to the form that Alameda could take with this real variety of future potential.\nSpeaker 1: The one comment I do want to add is I live over here in the East End in the AR one zone. R One is not mentioned in this opportunity. Cyclist And so I encourage the city to think of ways to let all of the zones contribute to different housing sizes and potentials over time.\nSpeaker 1: Thanks again to city staff and the planning board and to council for these comments.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next.\nSpeaker 2: Speaker. Let's try Galen again. Galen Parsons. Let's see. It works now. Can you hear me now?\nSpeaker 0: Yes, we sure can.\nSpeaker 2: That is. All members, thank you for the opportunity to speak. The housing element for the city of Alameda should be compliant with state law. It should be aligned with our values of equity and justice, embodied in the statement Everyone belongs here.\nSpeaker 2: We will never know what we lost in this city as a consequence of redlining. The neighbor, the neighbors we never got to know because certain housing types were explicitly disallowed. That had consequences for family wealth and it had severe consequences for the vibrancy of our community.\nSpeaker 2: We know that neighbors that we have lost as a consequence of the forced housing scarcity that have driven a housing crisis for the last 40 plus years. I miss my neighbors desperately. Who moved away. Those families who were displaced.\nSpeaker 2: I will never forget those families.\nSpeaker 1: A470 Central.\nSpeaker 2: We have a responsibility to the past to build a better future for Alameda communities. And tonight, that means acknowledging that our responsibility as a city with good transportation options and close proximity to jobs is to comply with state law to maximize housing on the former base.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, and to ensure that our residential zoning can.\nSpeaker 1: Credibly.\nSpeaker 2: Result in 5353 units between 2023 and 2031 that are not in only one area on the island. Encourage you to adopt the staff resolution tonight, recognizing that change is constant. And together we can plan in Alameda where everyone truly belongs.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Grover Whitman brown.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. Speaker waving throughout the evening.\nSpeaker 2: Council members, i am calling in to express my support for the city staff's resolution as they stated and specifically. We want to emphasize how important it is that affordable housing and multifamily housing is dispersed throughout the city and not pressed onto the base as part of affirmatively furthering fair housing and ensuring that the benefits opportunities of having\nSpeaker 2: neighbors who have different class statuses and who are younger and older and not just earning age with two children and a dog and a white picket fence, are able to live on our island. And so please consider the bright, vibrant future that can be when we really invest in creating the community that we need in the future\nSpeaker 2: . Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Christopher Buckley.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, Speaker Buckley.\nSpeaker 1: Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: We sure can. Hi.\nSpeaker 1: Very, very good. Good evening. Christopher Buckley with the Alameda Architectural Preservation Society. We sent you a letter last night which summarizes previous letters that you should have received. I like to go over several of the points in the letter.\nSpeaker 1: First, we do support the idea of filing the appeal. We agree it's a long shot, but we don't think it will do any harm. Second, concerning the resolution, we agree with the Planning Board recommendation to delete that clause concerning Article 26.\nSpeaker 1: But if the Council would like to leave something like that in there, we suggested some alternative language. I would also like to hear from the city attorney as to the necessity of including that statement. In there, we believe it's overly broad and basically state law does not totally preempt Article 26.\nSpeaker 1: It only partially preempts Article 26. And then finally, we think the overall strategy presented in the staff reports is very good, particularly the emphasis on looking to Alameda Point and also other sites like internal terminals as a way of meeting a good part of the arena numbers.\nSpeaker 1: We would like to promote that further, including the idea of asking the Navy to lift the cap on Alameda Point. And the idea here isn't to throw all the all the marina in the Alameda point, but to maximize options as to where to distribute it and also take advantage of the site opportunities that Alameda Point offers.\nSpeaker 1: Also to expand the idea of internal terminals and look at the estuary shopping centers as as sites are including bridge side Alameda landing and Marina and Marina village marina village has expressed interest recently. We'd like council direct staff to check to check with the other two and see if they're interested.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Fletcher.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, Speaker Fletcher. You just want to unmute?\nSpeaker 2: Here we go. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity, Mayor Ashcraft. Members of the council and our wonderful city staff. I'm speaking tonight to urge you to direct staff to develop a comprehensive game plan to successfully renegotiate Alameda Points residential caps with the U.S. Navy.\nSpeaker 2: There's one thing that we all seem to agree on in every staff report in the draft resolution of the housing element and in comments submit submitted by our community based organizations and activists that we want to adopt a housing element that maximizes the use of city owned land.\nSpeaker 2: At Alameda Point, this is a major tool in our toolbox for meeting our regional housing needs allocation. And yet the preliminary site inventory doesn't reference the potential beyond the current cap. It's clear that we can't maximize the use of city owned land at Alameda Point without lifting unreasonable and outdated caps on housing units.\nSpeaker 2: This effort needs to begin now and be on a parallel track with preparing our housing element. Is it possible to add language to the resolution or the housing element that acknowledges that the city is taking action to renegotiate obsolete caps that don't serve present day needs?\nSpeaker 2: That the renegotiation climate is in our favor and that we project a reliable potential for X number of additional housing units that could be provided, including 25% affordable on the base. These units could easily relieve pressure of shoehorning 500.\nSpeaker 2: Housing units into medium density neighborhoods, as also shown on the preliminary side inventory. Please consider this. There are 482 cities in California and each one is required to make available its fair share of sites to address the housing crisis.\nSpeaker 2: Regardless of the burden or the impacts. But there is only one city in the entire state that has the opportunity to absorb its fair share on a 1500 acre piece of land that's been waiting for 25 years to fulfill its destiny as a collection of vibrant, diverse and take your time.\nSpeaker 0: Matt Reed should evening Speaker Reed.\nSpeaker 1: Hello, Mayor and Council once again. Thank you. I want to indicate my support for filing an appeal. I can't be the only person thinking that the state hands out numbers expecting cities to appeal. Many of your fellow Bay Area cities are doing just that.\nSpeaker 1: And so this is a negotiation. So it's time for us to take the next step. I also fully support what the previous speaker said about dealing with the Navy and trying to lift those caps. That seems absurd. They should have such a strong say in the future of our city.\nSpeaker 1: I thought we parted ways a while ago. So and then lastly, I think, honestly, the projections for growth in California are a bit rosy. I keep wondering if the city council and planners in Detroit, Michigan, in 1960 were having the same conversation about sustained growth over the next 20 to 30 years and demanding that zoning laws be\nSpeaker 1: dropped to support multi-family housing in every neighborhood. And I see this coming from the R to myself. And so, you know, I'm questioning the projections. We just lost a congressperson. The economy could take one wrong turn, and now you've got less growth.\nSpeaker 1: So for what it's worth, please do file that appeal. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Your next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Herman Reid.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening.\nSpeaker 2: Speaker Reid. Hello? Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: We can.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Good evening, Mayor. And City Council members and city staff. I am in full support of appealing the arena allocation numbers and I ask that the city pursue this further. I see this as a very simple issue.\nSpeaker 2: As Alameda is limited in our geography, we are primarily an island city with the peninsula and Harbor Bay and Bay Farm, and we don't have enough bridges or tunnels to accommodate. Proposed growth of thousands of units without the necessary infrastructure.\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your consideration and urge you to ask Alameda to join other cities in petitioning a reduction of our numbers. The Embarcadero Institute did and did an interesting study last year, and I ask that you review it. It mentions that the Rina calculations are not correct.\nSpeaker 2: I also concur with Christopher Buckley's thoughtful comments. I also want to make a brief comment regarding making public comments and was wondering if you could please allow the necessary time for the community to respond and raise their hand.\nSpeaker 2: Many people may not know how to raise their hand or what numbers to push if they're calling in on the phone. So I ask that you please be patient and welcoming so that all of our community members can participate.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'll just add that I think we are both patient and welcoming. But madam, quick, do you want to just give the instructions for if you are both about making sure your Zoom app is the latest? And also, if you you're calling in from a cell phone.\nSpeaker 2: Right? So, yes, in order to promote you, please do have the most current version of Zoom or else we won't be able to promote you. We do have a guide posted online as well and if you are calling in, the information for the calling is at the top of the agenda and you can hit Star nine to\nSpeaker 2: raise your hand. And we have one more speaker on this item. Rose Linda Fortuna.\nSpeaker 0: And thank you for that, Madam Clerk. Welcome. Speaker four Tuna.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. I wanted to ask the council and the mayor a question. California has a water shortage problem. Can you tell me how you're going to solve the water shortage problem for the entire state? I know that many people want to live in California, but do we have the resources for everyone to be able to come to California\nSpeaker 2: ? If you really believe that you can solve the water problem, then go ahead and proceed with what you are planning to do. If you don't believe you can accommodate people so they can live in California with the proper resources that we need, then then go ahead and file for the appeal.\nSpeaker 2: Everybody wants to come to California, but we can't accommodate everyone. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And more speakers.\nSpeaker 2: That was our last speaker.\nSpeaker 0: All right. With that, I will close public comment and I.\nSpeaker 2: Will.\nSpeaker 0: Open it up to, well, council deliberation. And then with a special emphasis on.\nSpeaker 2: The.\nSpeaker 0: Four questions that Mr. Thomas presented to us. And if it's agreeable to council, I think, and city attorney's, please chime in. I think that perhaps we want to start with a discussion and vote on whether or not to file an appeal of our rent allocation.\nSpeaker 0: I see you nodding, Mr. Sharon, but you know how the court reporter can't take down nonverbal communications? Can you tell it to us verbally, please?\nSpeaker 1: Sure. I wasn't sure that was necessarily a question to me. But, yes, I. I think we would recommend that you take up that question first because it is time sensitive. And I believe Mr. Thomas needs to file papers either late Thursday or early Friday.\nSpeaker 1: So he's looking forward for direction on that first and foremost.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, counsel. Everyday thought.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Quickly, I would recommend that we have our time set out 15 minutes. We have before us three incredible meaty topics, 3 to 4 meaty topics, each of which could be agenda items in and of themselves, and each of which represents incredibly substantive, in-depth analysis.\nSpeaker 1: And I just think that 9 minutes is not enough. I think we should have 15 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: This is what I'm willing to do. Let's see how far we get on this first item that I'd like us to consider. And I'm more than willing to consider a motion for expanding time. And maybe it's 15, or maybe it's even something else that I.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Herrera Spencer, your. Your resolution is titled Resolution of Intent to appeal to want to make a motion.\nSpeaker 2: I would like to move that. We file that we file an appeal. And that's not the the entire title. That was just the beginning of the title for those that are just listening and have it full of the document.\nSpeaker 2: But it does include filing an appeal and it says for some of the reasons I think we could include, but we have heard reports from other speakers and we see emails. What I would like to make a motion that the city appeal the prescribed screening numbers.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Is there a second? Councilmember ADFA. I think he might be muted partly.\nSpeaker 1: I'll second the motion.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you. Okay. For the discussion. Or should we just take a vote?\nSpeaker 3: Ask a question.\nSpeaker 0: Of course. Sorry.\nSpeaker 3: Not sorry. Well, this appeal. Provide direction to staff on what we are appealing and how. Rather than asking them to come up with their own ideas.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Harry Spencer, so on.\nSpeaker 2: So first of all, I want to apologize for getting this proposed my proposed resolution submitted today and is actually late today because of the holiday weekend and working with staff. And I do want to thank staff taking my questions and helping me with this.\nSpeaker 2: But within this document, on page two, I lost some reasons and I know there have been others. For those of you that are trying to follow along, it was attached to the agenda item. And I think it says the title is like proposal proposed resolution from Fisher expenses.\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted to find it. But some of the reasons I actually tried to include just the so I start with on page two that the cities I should own is about my time for this cause it is on here.\nSpeaker 2: But yes, some of the reasons I set forth go to the landmass size approximately ten square miles. The know I.\nSpeaker 0: May I ask you a question? Yes. Clarifying question. Are you saying that the previously approved projects that will result in construction of approximately 1522 housing units should suffice as our arena allocation. Is that why that number is there?\nSpeaker 0: No. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: So that was actually from the original resolution. I just I kept as much of the original resolution that I thought I could support, and then I added other language to it.\nSpeaker 0: So are you are you proposing any arena allocation for Alameda?\nSpeaker 2: I know I would. Well, I don't have a specific number of council wants to discuss when I. From what I understand and I don't know, my staff can help me. I don't know that we've proposed the number or if we just say that we're appealing their number.\nSpeaker 0: Well, I believe you have to have grounds for the appeal. But Mr. Thomas, could you shed some light on that for us?\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think a stronger appeal probably provides a recommended number. But I you know, as we've said in multiple staff reports, we think it's going to be a very, very low chance of success. So what we're looking for is give us if you'd like us to appeal, if you can direct us towards the arguments that you would\nSpeaker 1: like us to make. And if you have a particular number in mind, absolutely. Give that to us as well as attorney. City Attorney Sharon said, you know, we just have a couple of days to put this together. So we really and we're doing it on behalf of the council.\nSpeaker 1: So let us know what you want us to say and we will take it from there.\nSpeaker 0: Counselor, our dissertation did not.\nSpeaker 1: Was there not an alternative? Read a number other than the 5300 with roughly around 3300. Is that a question for me? And no, no, not that I'm aware of.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, Councilman? That's right.\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: So I plan to support the appeal tonight. I do not plan to support the resolution as written. I would if the maker of the motion to the second hour of the motion were willing, I would list the following three reasons for why.\nSpeaker 3: For the basis for our appeal. One is 60% of our voters recently voted to uphold our adopted charter provision that prohibits multi-family housing from being built, meaning our reallocation means thwarting the will of our voters. Altimeters uniqueness is an island of the San Francisco Bay, subject to sea level and emerging groundwater issues, trans liquefaction and loss of\nSpeaker 3: access to the mainland. Should an earthquake destroy our bridges and tubes? And lastly, our transportation and infrastructure constraints? We are an island with limited ingress and egress and water supply transported by pipelines on the mainland. Unlike many cities, Alameda lacks direct access to BART within their borders, and these mirror the comments we've received from many people in\nSpeaker 3: the community who have asked us to appeal.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Harry Spencer.\nSpeaker 2: So I appreciate those reasons and I'm happy to include those reasons when we're not quite and I'm not sure then that if you spoke to the significant geological seismic issues also if that was within there. But that was those are things, you know, the fault within the fault zone.\nSpeaker 2: So if you look at those paragraphs, that's actually a lot other than the building issue. I think that that those are reasons. I think that the language in here is broader, includes more points. But I would agree to include those that also.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm happy to come up with a number if we think we have a number.\nSpeaker 0: Perhaps council member, not white has a number in mind. Or is it zero?\nSpeaker 3: My number is that that I'm okay with the methodology. I just think that they should look at our uniqueness and let us know how they might adjust it.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, Counselor. Every day. Zach, I see your hands up.\nSpeaker 2: You're muted again. Councilmember DE So.\nSpeaker 1: I'm fine with item two and item three raised by Councilmember NOx five. But I think item one, even for the No on Z crowd, was more nuanced in that we understand that, that we have an obligation with regard to multi-family housing and we've been meeting it through the housing over housing overlay and the density bonus within the\nSpeaker 1: context of Measure A. That that's that's the reality.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Other council comments before we take a vote and I'll go last vice mayor of village when I say I think.\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to be supporting the appeal tonight. I appreciate the position that my council colleagues are taking relative to representing the will of the people. I also think that we've had a number of subsequent presentations from our regional bodies and from other groups about really addressing kind of the hardest of all of the issues that were\nSpeaker 2: raised. It's the it appears that there's going to be support for the appeal. I just you know, it just concerns me because I think, as one of our speakers mentioned, Christopher Buckley. He doesn't think that it's it's going to be successful, but we are going to be spending staff time on it.\nSpeaker 2: And I just I don't like taking frivolous action, but I understand wanting to get clarity in terms of perhaps having somebody else be the adult in the room and saying, no, you have to do this.\nSpeaker 0: I will chime in and say most emphatically that I do not support an appeal. And while I appreciate our uniqueness as an island, I can tell you from the statewide and regional bodies I serve on that the Uniqueness Club is not an exclusive one and there are states up and down.\nSpeaker 0: There are cities up and down this state who would argue that they are coastal cities, they're built on hillsides, they have fire danger, they're in earthquake zones. And if everyone were to do this and bear in mind that the reason that Housing and Community Development Department of the State of California has these rules that the legislature has\nSpeaker 0: enacted is because cities around this state are not and have not met their obligation to provide housing. And so year after year, the housing crisis only got worse. And sometimes it's a matter of delaying so much that a project becomes so expensive, so costly, that it can't be built.\nSpeaker 0: There's all different ways that you can stall a project, try to kill a project. What I would prefer for us to do and what I think our city has generally been very adept at over the years and working with our very competent staff is look for the solutions.\nSpeaker 0: Because, again, we know this. We know people that it's not that each city will just simply say, Oh, you know what? A big 101 cities and nine counties that make up the Association of Bay Area Governments. Never mind that housing crisis thing, we'll just let it slide for a few years.\nSpeaker 0: No, they just take the portion of our housing number and put them somewhere else. Maybe in Oakland. I don't know where, but they're going to go somewhere else. And by the way, appeals are not just made by a particular city.\nSpeaker 0: Other cities can appeal are as I mean, there are other cities who could say, you know, we don't think Alameda is taking on enough housing. They've hardly built multifamily over the years. I mean, it's a it's a slippery slope to go down.\nSpeaker 0: I don't think our grounds are very strong. I could be wrong, but I've sure been in a lot of meetings and listened to the arguments presented. But, you know, this is a democratic body. We go by a majority vote.\nSpeaker 2: So I am.\nSpeaker 0: Surprised and disappointed that a majority wants to support this. But again, we whether we like it or not, the majority vote of the council is what we abide by. So if there's no further discussion. Councilmember Harry Spencer.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. And and I'm not sure if this is a member Knox's comments in regards to also pointing out that portions of the city are were created by filling in the San Francisco Bay so it's them feel more and more vulnerable to seismic events and susceptible to the convection.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for pointing that out. We share that quality with other cities around the Bay Area.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Desai I think our appeal would be strengthened if we had a number in there. Granted, you know what that number is in the last three, an allocation, it was roughly 1730, something like that. And I think in this new allocation is roughly 5300.\nSpeaker 1: I just think, you know, if if I think if we're going to go in there with an allocation, we need to go in there with a number. I think splitting the difference, I think, is, is it sounds fair.\nSpeaker 1: So 5300 divided by two is 2650. So 2650 is substantially above our 1733 allocation, previous allocation. So I would I would just go with 2650 as as the number because I think we need to go in there with something because they might say, okay, well, we'll allow your thing, but instead of 50, 300, you get 50, 100\nSpeaker 0: . And did you want to also specify what city you think should take our.\nSpeaker 1: No, that's not my responsibility. That's a that's a bags responsibility or or California's responsibility. My responsibility is to just specify a number that that I think the city of Alameda can and bear. I don't think we can bear 5300.\nSpeaker 1: We're an island 2600. I mean, it's still substantially above last time, 1730 allocation. But but at least it's something. So so I would go with 2650 is splitting the difference of 5300 our current allocation. So that would be my suggested amendment.\nSpeaker 0: And I forgot who did. Did you make the motion?\nSpeaker 1: I did make those.\nSpeaker 0: Who made it accountable for her, Spencer.\nSpeaker 2: I think I made the original motion. And then I think, remember not. I had some additional language, which I'm fine with, and I'm fine with this number.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We need to get clarity on what it is we're voting on at all.\nSpeaker 2: All of them.\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry. Can you restate the motion as you understand it?\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So it was my motion to appeal, but then to in regards to Director Thomas wanting some grounds member. Not so. I articulated some grounds. I added some.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I'm looking for specificity for the city clerk. Those grounds are.\nSpeaker 2: That I don't I hopefully she had or or.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Knox. Right.\nSpeaker 3: I haven't written down I can say it again and I'd be happy to just email it to the city clerk as well as the and.\nSpeaker 0: For the public. Can you say it again?\nSpeaker 3: But I just said I would.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Point one. 60% of voters recently upheld the voter adopted city charter provision that prohibits multifamily housing from being built in L.A. Not meeting arena allocation means thwarting the will of the voters. Almeida's uniqueness as an island in the bay, subject to sea level rise and emergent groundwater liquefaction and loss of access to the mainland in an earthquake\nSpeaker 3: which could destroy all of our bridges and tubes. And point three Transportation and infrastructure. Alameda is an island with limited ingress and egress and water supply transported from pipelines on to the mainland. Unlike other East Bay cities, Alameda lacks direct access to BART within its borders.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And it counts day.\nSpeaker 1: So I guess in my amendment. Point number one was to say whatever the final sentence is, to put a comma saying, recognizing that the city of Alameda has adopted the density bonus law and the multifamily housing overlay to meet state law regarding multifamily housing and multi-family housing and and RINA obligations.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: I would take out the density. Bonus is not allowed to be used in the arena determination. So mentioning it here only confuses things and actually makes us look like we don't know what we're talking about.\nSpeaker 1: No, that's just not. Not true. Density bonus laws at the heart of of modifying measure because the density bonus law has two components, one of which is the regulatory component that allows you to be free from the from measure a.\nSpeaker 1: The second component is the quantitative formula that that that it's so so you got it. It's the density bonus law that that allows you to be free from Measure eight. It's just because the city of Alameda adopted the state density bonus law and the regulatory framework of that.\nSpeaker 1: All right.\nSpeaker 3: With all respect, that that's not how it happens. We adopted a multifamily overlay to get around the state regulations. The density bonus law allows us to go above the MF overlay, but literally in arena law and housing element, a law does not allow us to use the density bonus to achieve our Reno numbers.\nSpeaker 3: So I think it would make us look very.\nSpeaker 0: Bad if we're going to have one speaker at a time. Councilmember de SAC hold on. And Councilmember, I'm not saying continue yours, your comment.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm simply saying that since we are not allowed to use the density bonus to calculate any of our arena numbers, using it to say this is how we're going to make our arena numbers makes us look like we don't know what we're talking about.\nSpeaker 3: And I do not think our letter appealing this is going to look very sincere or authoritative if we're including things that show that we don't understand the law itself.\nSpeaker 0: Councilor Redford.\nSpeaker 1: My point is this, is that what the every time we have a multi a project project proponent who wants to do a multifamily housing, the first thing one of the first thing they have to do is they have to pull the density bonus trigger.\nSpeaker 1: And the part of the density bonus trigger that they're pulling is the part that speaks to the getting relief from the regulatory local regulatory regimes that constrict affordable housing. That's that's the part of the density bonus trigger that they first have to pull.\nSpeaker 1: They're also going to pull the second part that says, oh, by the way, here's a mathematical formula by which you can increase the number of housing above and beyond what you would typically do. So the density bonus law is a critical part of of our meeting, you know, our our affordable housing obligations.\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if you look at, for example, the staff report, the staff report says that it that when you calculate the density bonus law in the meeting, our affordable housing numbers, it's not 30 units per acre, but it's 36 units per acre.\nSpeaker 1: So the point is they're already calculating it in there. So it is an intimate partner.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Desai, I'm just going to interrupt you and forgive the interruption. I don't think either one of you is going to convince the other as we sit here tonight. So we have a couple of choices. We can include everything or we can vote on an appeal that does include the reference to density bonus fire and multi-family overlay\nSpeaker 0: . And when that doesn't. You also have the the number, the suggested number. So let's figure out what we want to do and let's take a vote. But what are we going to vote on? I appreciate you laying out there.\nSpeaker 0: And I was taking notes. I'm sure the city clerk was, too, but where are we going to go on that one? Hold out for just a minute. Councilor rehearse. Spencer I want to give Councilor Woodside the chance to finish his thought.\nSpeaker 1: Then I think two things. One is I think we should go, we should adopt a number. I think that's that's important. And I'm sorry, but you know, 2654 purpose is at a summit for four at a cemetery. On the second point, I think we have to recognize that the dense I think we maybe the way to frame\nSpeaker 1: it is to say, as I said before, comma, recognizing that the city has employed the state density bonus law into its own local ordinances as well as created a multi-family overlay comma in an effort to build multifamily housing.\nSpeaker 1: So I'll be I'll be silent as to the arena, but I'll say in an effort to build multi-family housing. So I take I strictly any reference to Rita. By the way, this is why this all of this subject is very complicated.\nSpeaker 1: And that's why we require a lot of time.\nSpeaker 0: No, no disagreement there. Counsel for her expense. You had your hand up.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I was just going to give it to Director Thomas and see if he thinks he can somehow make this make sense so that it does make it look like we do know what we're talking about. Given this input.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I think what I'm hearing is Councilmember de SA saying, look, if we're going to talk about the measure Z and the city wide prohibition, also clarify that we do allow multifamily housing through multifamily overlay and density bonus.\nSpeaker 1: And then but also in response to Councilmember Knox, why don't use that as an argument as to why we're going to get 2650 units? Because he's right. State law says you can't don't you can't count on density bonus.\nSpeaker 1: That's something that's offered. A developer may take advantage of it, but you can't count on developers taking advantage of it. So I think we can right the appeal. So it makes that distinction clear and it doesn't show. I'm not going to write a letter that makes us look stupid.\nSpeaker 1: And that'll be my first job.\nSpeaker 2: And then could I follow up? Do you feel like you have sufficient direction from council given this motion and what you've heard from the other council members?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, we can work. We can work with this.\nSpeaker 0: Let's get a motion before we did, because we hadn't quite finished the issue of including the number their agreement on including the 2650 number.\nSpeaker 2: I'm fine with that number.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember That's why.\nSpeaker 3: I will support I prefer no number, but I'll support the number if that's what they want.\nSpeaker 0: And you can send that message home as anything. Any thoughts about that?\nSpeaker 1: I. I think we just go with it. I. I think we will explain it sort of as Councilmember de Song explained it. Hey, we were we were able in this last cycle to do about 1750. It was 1725, but it was a stretch.\nSpeaker 1: We think with a little more stretching, we can get to 2650 at the next cycle. But what I heard the Councilmember de SOG saying, you know, 53 is not within our reach, 2650, we believe is. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I think we have clarity on the motion and it's been assuming the center of the motion, which was you. Councilmember Desai Correct.\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And you accept others the additional language. Okay. Okay. Then we have a motion and a second, an agreement with the added language. So maybe we have a roll call vote.\nSpeaker 2: Please remember de sac or center. I Knox White. I Vela. No mayor. As the Ashcraft know, that motion carries 3 to 2.\nSpeaker 0: All right. All right, everybody. So then let's move on to the next question that. Mr. Thomas posed to us, which is the is the you know, Mr. Thomas, you're probably better able to decipher what you said than my reading my notes.\nSpeaker 1: I think where we are at now is we have sort of three different resolutions on the table. They all three have common denominators. All three support doing a housing element in compliance of state law. All three support using multifamily housing as necessary to meet the Rena.\nSpeaker 1: All three support the idea of maximizing the use of city land. Where they differ is in how they characterize Measure A and the relationship between Measure A and the charter. The planning board stripped all the language out entirely.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Herrera's stripped it out entirely. So I think there's a question do you want to strip it out entirely or not? If you don't, then you go with the staff resolution or some variation of it. Chris Buckley did have suggested a variation where it's not completely stripped, but partially stripped.\nSpeaker 1: The second thing that differs here is Councilmember Herrera's resolution puts a big emphasis or adds an emphasis which is not inconsistent with the others, but it puts extra emphasis on the need to renegotiate or at least actively push to negotiate the Navy cap with the Navy and try to get that eliminated.\nSpeaker 1: And the concept there is under the cap we can only get and what the staff report points out, we can get about 1200 units of our 53 at Alameda Point. I think the intent of renegotiating the cap would be to try to max to try to get more than 1200 at Almeida Point.\nSpeaker 1: We have a variety of constraints that our point allow me to point at which we are going to have to work through as a community over the next year even to get to 1250. But certainly from staff's perspective, the idea of removing the cap at Almeida Point is a good idea.\nSpeaker 1: Even if we don't get it done for this cycle, you're going to need it in future cycles. That cap from staff perspective has got to go. The sooner the better. But I think just the last point on that, there are some of your speakers there are there there are fair housing aspects of out of state housing law\nSpeaker 1: . The idea that we're going to do all of our units at Alameda Point, I think that is not a strategy that is going to be successful. But the idea of, you know, the fact that Alameda Point has a lot of land that's vacant and underutilized and it's also where we can do 25% affordable, makes for a strong\nSpeaker 1: case for why we want to maximize the use of Alameda point. So I think those are the big differences and I think those are the kind of where we would be looking for some clarification from the council. And once again, we're just we're looking for direction and conformation.\nSpeaker 1: How do you the council want to lead this next year process? What do you want us focusing on?\nSpeaker 0: I want to just ask a question about that point about the Navy cap. I don't disagree with that. I've been talking for probably a couple of years and definitely as long as I've been mayor about when are we going to approach the Navy?\nSpeaker 0: Because it just doesn't make sense in this day and age when we have a housing crisis to have to pay a premium to add more housing at Alameda Point. However, I'm not sure that the wisest approach is to signal that by putting it in this resolution, Hey, Navy, this is what we're going to do.\nSpeaker 0: I think we have a congresswoman in D.C. We've certainly discussed this with her. We have lobbyists. We have ways to go about doing that. I want that negotiation to be as successful and effective as possible. And I'm just wondering if we can't accomplish that same goal by giving staff clear direction that we want you to begin exploring\nSpeaker 0: , pursuing this lifting of the of the cap. And, I mean, I happen to think there would just be lots of political support for that. But anyway, we'll take it.\nSpeaker 1: Just answer that quickly, I think from staff's perspective, where it could. Either way is fine with us. I mean, obviously, you can just give us direction, and particularly if you think politically we might have more success. If we do it that way, then, you know, we would certainly agree with you.\nSpeaker 1: We want to have a successful negotiation and whatever that's going to take. And we want a quick one.\nSpeaker 0: Those are my $0.02 worth, Councilmember Spencer.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Director Thomas. So I included the language in my proposed resolution in regards to the cap, because I think, as you pointed out, of course, that additional 1000. How much is it? $1,000 or something now per unit?\nSpeaker 2: $3,100 per unit. Sorry, 100,000 per unit. In addition, does then make it harder to build affordable housing complicates is that for me, the goal is not to build luxury housing or high income housing. It is to build workforce housing or affordable housing and housing for the middle.\nSpeaker 2: However you want to describe it, that 100,000 obviously makes a difference in increasing the developer's costs and then gets passed on to the consumer. And so I included this because I would like to be able to support a resolution.\nSpeaker 2: But these points are important to me that it all be in one document, which is what I was looking for. I appreciate we already did the language on the appeal though, so I guess I would be okay with striking that.\nSpeaker 2: But some of the next step then is like I want someone to be able to read this and see how it relates to each other. I think we do need to reduce that cap and look our increase the cap, reduce the cost to build out at the point in order to try to meet these numbers, especially if\nSpeaker 2: we end up at the 5300 if we don't get any reduction. So I was trying to come up with an inclusive document thinking.\nSpeaker 1: Councilor Desai thank you in my three minute remaining 3 minutes. So this is where things get a little complicated because I think it's not the two. There are three items commitment to housing, element compliance, adopting multifamily zoning, and the fourth being use of vacant city land.\nSpeaker 1: So I just want to talk quickly to number two and three, commitment to housing element compliance and adopting multifamily zoning. And so this is why I think this this issue really is a standalone issue in and of itself, because the kind of the issue that's not being addressed here is the general plan and the land use category\nSpeaker 1: that we are creating in the general plan. And so one of the general plan, land use categories that we are creating is something called mixed community, mixed use, land, community mixed use. And that is a that is a general plan designation that's going to be put on certain places.\nSpeaker 1: Most was particularly shopping centers. The issue, though, is that community mixed use land use category will have a density of 30 to 65 units per acre. Now, one thing is land use category, but the other thing is zoning.\nSpeaker 1: So it's possible that we don't change the zoning. But the way that our codes read is that where there are inconsistencies between the densities that are expressed in the general plan and the density that are expressed in the zoning, the general planned land use category takes precedence.\nSpeaker 1: And this is in density bonus areas, and practically every new housing development is going to be a density bonus project. So this is where I think the discussion is a lot more richer than just kind of voting on these things.\nSpeaker 1: I think we have to have a more detailed discussion.\nSpeaker 0: Councilor David, Mr. Thomas has his hand up. Let's hear from him on this. Mr. Thomas.\nSpeaker 1: Let me just quickly clarify if I can. I think what Councilmember De Saag is referring to is the current the March draft of the general plan, where we were put forward recommendations for land use classifications. And one of them is the shopping center land use classification that he made reference to.\nSpeaker 1: And when that in that draft that we released in March, we identified the types of densities and zoning that might be necessary to get to 5300. The planning board and a number of speakers on that draft said, Whoa, you're going too fast, too quickly here.\nSpeaker 1: Let's just keep the general plan more general. Let's decide what the necessary zoning is and densities in the various land use classifications and the zoning when we do the housing on. That's when we need to make these tough decisions.\nSpeaker 1: So just last week, staff released proposed revisions to that draft general plan where we brought that land use classifications much more into sync with what we currently have. So essentially that land use classification that Councilmember Desai is referring to.\nSpeaker 1: We have eliminated all the language that we're recommending to the planning board eliminate and not recommend the language that Councilmember De Saag is describing. And we're just using an R, which is from the existing zoning for the shopping centers.\nSpeaker 1: That's what we are recommending. The planning board recommend to you City Council, just in terms of process, that general plan, if all goes well, we'll be coming to the City Council for review and approval and you can certainly make changes to that general plan before it gets adopted.\nSpeaker 1: That will happen this fall. And then what will happen is next fall, if all goes well, the Planning Board will be recommending the housing element to the City Council with the necessary zoning to meet our arena in which, you know, and whatever that arena ends up being.\nSpeaker 1: So we've set this up as a sequence of steps which allow you to make these decisions, we think, in a logical way and not getting the cart before the horse, which is, I think what Councilmember De Saag was was sort of getting was getting concerned about.\nSpeaker 0: So Councilmember, they said, just for clarification, my question to you is, are you suggesting with regard to the second question, Mr. Thomas posed, that we would not be committed to adopting a housing element that is in compliance with state law?\nSpeaker 0: And I would like to add, and I think you're probably aware of the pretty dire consequences that would result for our city if we weren't to be if we were to adopt a housing element that didn't comply with state law.\nSpeaker 2: Well.\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: Just quickly with one minute.\nSpeaker 0: Well, what about extending your time?\nSpeaker 1: What I'm saying is that this issue is so complex and convoluted that it's just not. Look at housing element, look at multifamily zoning. There's also these other outstanding issues like what categories and what densities we come up with in the general plan land use section and how all of this interplays into, you know, what the at the\nSpeaker 1: point in time a developer wants to build somewhere, let's say they want to build on the horrible landing center. You know, what are the rules that they that they can rely on to build at the densities that they seek?\nSpeaker 1: And so I think that what I'm getting at is that, you know, that level of discussion, you know, isn't before us. So I my my sense is that, you know, we should really be doing the housing element compliance and adopting multifamily zoning kind of kind of separate as a standalone discussion on some other night.\nSpeaker 1: It's so complicated.\nSpeaker 0: Hmm. I see what you're saying. So, Mr. Thomas, we definitely have a deadline for filing the Reena appeal, which is to say, Friday. As far as these other items, we have a little more time. What's what's your thought?\nSpeaker 1: Well, we are proceeding, and I, I guess I, we are proceeding on the assumption that we are going to need multifamily overlays. That's just the way we needed them to get to 1725 in the last cycle and just be cool and just like we needed them to get to 2200 or 2300 the cycle before.\nSpeaker 1: So that's all we're saying. We're not asking you to commit to where they will be. We're not asking you to commit to whether it's going to be 30 units or 36 units or 30. That's what we're going to spend the next year working with the community and the planning board and with all of you on.\nSpeaker 1: So all the.\nSpeaker 0: More general says, a more general concept.\nSpeaker 1: We're asking right now if if any of you are like, No, I never want to see a multifamily overlay brought to the city council, ever. Tell us now, because that's the conversation we need to be having right now, because we believe we are absolutely going to be bringing you multifamily overlays to get this housing homeowner adopted.\nSpeaker 1: There is no scenario where that is not part of our equation. So if there's any councilmember who doesn't saying, look, I do not want to ever see one. That's the conversation we want to have, whether it's 30 or 32 years or 28 units or 38 units.\nSpeaker 1: That's a that's a very important conversation. And we're going to need a year to work through that with the community and the planning board before we can even come back to you with recommendations at that level of detail.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember, next, what you got here.\nSpeaker 3: So to that point, I think there has been talk at previous council members about coming back with a policy for the council to adopt related to MFF. My concern is that right now the staff recommendation is kind of wishy washy.\nSpeaker 3: I remember with all respect, Councilmember Hirsch Spencer's is even less clear. It just kind of commits us to something, but it doesn't really answer that question and I don't think we should be spending time on MFF overlays if there's not support for AMF overlays.\nSpeaker 3: And so I'm curious to me, I'd be interested in giving staff direction to come back because the other, the other concern I doubt that either I'll just flag is that you know, we're talking about MFF overlays and I think some of us think that the MFF overlay is a specific thing with a specific number.\nSpeaker 3: But in the presentations to the planning board or whatever else, it's very clear that MFF overlay could have 30, could have 60. I haven't seen 120, but it could have 120. Right. The MFF overlay and I think having some idea of what we're I don't want to, I don't want staff spinning the reels and coming back with\nSpeaker 3: something at the end of the day thinking they heard oh there's support for MFF overlays and then all the work is kind of torn apart because it doesn't meet preconceived notions that weren't what were intended. And so I think getting some policy direction tonight and possibly maybe at our next meeting would be smart.\nSpeaker 0: In the future. Connie. Thank you. Councilwoman Farrakhan, you Councilmember de. I would just say that perhaps for consistency with the argument that you all raise are raising in your appeal of the arena numbers, you would want to bear in mind that if you're not supportive of a multifamily overlay zoning of some sort, then what you seem to\nSpeaker 0: be saying is you are for a single family residential, which certainly sounds like suburban sprawl, which doesn't seem environmentally advantageous for a city that's concerned with things like sea level rise, rising groundwater, etc.. But Councilmember de SAC.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, quickly. So here's what I'm supportive of multifamily overlay as it is currently used, meaning that the amount of density can never be more than 30 units per acre, but factor in without factoring density bonus, which comes out to be 36 units per acre.\nSpeaker 1: That's what we have multifamily overlay right now. It does not allow anything bigger than that. It has only 30 units per acre. That's the way the ordinance reads, plus density bonus, which comes out to be 36 units. And that's the way that that that I want I don't want to, you know, I don't want the underlying zoning\nSpeaker 1: or the underlying land use to be more than 30. That should be that's sufficient in terms of meeting state law, 30 units per acre in order to meet state law when it comes to multi-family housing.\nSpeaker 2: This time.\nSpeaker 1: I just clarified.\nSpeaker 0: We'll take care of that.\nSpeaker 1: If I just.\nSpeaker 0: Very quickly, please.\nSpeaker 1: Technically, theoretically, let's assume there are people is not is not successful. Let's assume we're doing a 5300 to get to 5300 and meet that criteria as outlined by Councilmember De Saag. We would literally have to spread the MF Overlay over much larger areas of the city.\nSpeaker 1: So the that the the benefit of being flexible on this, you do that through the community process. The community might say, no, we want to do a lot of housing at any point. We want to do it on these three shopping centers.\nSpeaker 1: And we really want you to minimize MF Overlay in the neighborhoods. To get to 5300, we might have to say, okay, we can do that. But that means the IMF overlay on the shopping centers has to be higher than 30 N.S.A. because otherwise the math doesn't get you to 53.\nSpeaker 1: So if we set this arbitrary cap of 30 U.S.A., now what the the the unintended consequences is we might have to apply it to larger areas and more of the neighborhood areas. So I would just argue that you might want to stay flexible on that at this point and let that planning process play out.\nSpeaker 1: If the community is like, well, try and spread it around. Let's put it in all the neighborhoods, the every neighborhood. Get some R MF overlay, but keep it at 30 USC acre and let's just get to 5400 that way.\nSpeaker 1: That's a viable way to do it. However, they may not. They may say no concentrate at these locations and and try to minimize. Where you put it in the neighborhood. So that's that's my only caution to that approach.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Before I call in another speaker, let's do a little housekeeping, because Councilmember Desai is at a time and I don't want to preclude anyone from this important discussion. So we're going to have Vice Mayor Vella. She can sell off some of her time.\nSpeaker 0: No. What would what would be reasonable folks? We could. Here's a thought. We could open to suggestion negotiation. We could just ask the city clerk to put us all back at nine. That means we were just starting on a level playing field for those of you who've held your time and you want nine plus.\nSpeaker 0: I just we've got another another item that we really need to get to tonight. And I do want to wrap this one up, but I'm open to suggestions. Councilmember Knox, why then decide?\nSpeaker 3: I think I was going to I'm going to say what I think Tony was going to recommend. We heard is our councilmember.\nSpeaker 0: Did mind reading going on. I love it.\nSpeaker 3: Let's just add 5 minutes. I'm sorry. I don't think it's it's it's arbitrary and unfair to let people who talk all the time talk a lot and everybody have the same numbers again.\nSpeaker 0: So we might be okay.\nSpeaker 3: Let's just add 5 minutes.\nSpeaker 2: All right.\nSpeaker 3: Get another five.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's a motion to add 5 minutes to everybody's time to have a second councilmember Dave, 5 seconds. Okay, let's take a roll call vote real quickly, please. Adding 5 minutes to everybody's time.\nSpeaker 2: Of member Dave.\nSpeaker 1: Guy.\nSpeaker 2: Amir Spencer. I next fight.\nSpeaker 3: Hi.\nSpeaker 2: Vella. I mean, Christy Ashcroft, I know, carries my five eyes.\nSpeaker 0: You should start with vice mayor of L.A.. Okay. All right. So let's see here. Council member. Well, we were okay. Councilor decided you want to respond to. But Mr. Thomas was explaining. No. Okay. So how are we going to treat this?\nSpeaker 0: Do we want to commit to adopting a housing element in compliance with state law, with the understanding that we will be coming back to fine tune exactly what that means. At a later date. Councilmember Harry Spencer.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. I would like to circle back to Director Thomas and ask, do you have an idea of what number you think it would work out to be since you've been looking at this? If it's not the 30 and 36, how dense do you think it could turn out to be to make it work when you're\nSpeaker 2: talking?\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, I think I think we should be we should be very flexible. I think it sounds crazy, but a two story building in one of the stations with housing that was built at the turn of the century is 80.\nSpeaker 0: Units the.\nSpeaker 1: Acre. It's only two stories. It's got small workforce units. Why is it such a high density? Because small, affordable units. It's only two stories.\nSpeaker 2: It's 80 units, the acre.\nSpeaker 1: So I would say don't get freaked out by that number. Now, 80 units, the acre at a huge site like South Shore. Not necessary. Not necessary at all. 30 units at South Shore. Plenty. Fine. No problem. But if you're talking about trying to encourage Ann, the is having this conversation right now with us like what's the right\nSpeaker 1: density? They're trying to encourage some projects to go forward because under the current regime, they haven't seen that kind of project in 40 years. So they're okay with this conversation, like maybe it's 40, maybe it's 35, maybe it's 50, we're not sure.\nSpeaker 1: But they know what shape and size of buildings they want. I think that's the right way to do it. I also think we need to just work this through. You know, what's appropriate on Webster Street is going to be different than what's appropriate at South Shore.\nSpeaker 1: What's appropriate, I'll make a point will be different than both of them. And I just think we should let the community decide. And what we've been trying to structure with the planning board and with the community is let's talk about how many units we want to get out of the allocation at each location.\nSpeaker 1: What the planning board has said and we've started this work. Show us massing diagrams like how tall are those buildings? How big are they? What do they look like? And then we will back into, well, what's the density we need before we decide?\nSpeaker 1: So that's the approach.\nSpeaker 0: And I was just going to jump in and just say, Councilmember Harry Spencer, I think you and I share the belief that some of our units need to be what's called affordable by design. They're just smaller, so they command a lower price mean.\nSpeaker 0: I think we need a whole range of of units, but I definitely want to see a lot of smaller units anyway. Tony Sorry. Councilor Desai had his hand up and then that's you. Councilor Hurray. Spencer.\nSpeaker 1: No, I. I'm from the vantage point that I think we should lead by the type of community that we think fits within our built environment. When you look at Alameda, you know, there's a kind of a homogeneity with respect to its built environment.\nSpeaker 1: Like, for example, if you go down Shoreline Avenue, there's kind of an elegance in the sense that most of the building, most of those apartments are of the same size. And that's because there is a uniform type of density throughout much of Alameda that I think people can live with.\nSpeaker 1: I think that's where we need to lead with. And so to me, you know, 30 units per acre isn't an arbitrary number. I mean, it is a number that that the state law or state practice or program requires.\nSpeaker 1: It has to you know, if they're going to own land to be arena eligible, it has to be a 30 unit minimum. That's why when we adopted the housing overlay as our planning director well knows, that's why the 30 units per, per, per acre number was used.\nSpeaker 1: I hear what he's saying. What he's saying is that, well, you know what? That but but if we don't come up with 26, 50 total allocation, which I want, but we come up instead of 5300, then I get it.\nSpeaker 1: The math won't work. Well, you know what? I'm sorry, but it's wrong to do 5300. And I'm not going to like I don't want to set in place a regime that accommodates 5300. I just don't you know, if there was going to be a regime that accommodates anything, it's going to it should be to accommodate 2650.\nSpeaker 1: And that, you know, without doing the math, I suspect that the the 30 units per acre current overlay regime will work without doing the Mafia. I suspect it would. But so so I'm leading from the example of, you know, if you create, you know, if you lean on the on the on the side of of being flexible\nSpeaker 1: , well, you're basically leaning on the side of being flexible to accommodate 5300 units. And I I'm just wary of that. And and so I just that's a concern. I would rather.\nSpeaker 0: Thomas and then Councilmember Harry Spencer.\nSpeaker 1: I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. I think we don't it's premature to decide, from my perspective, what the densities should be. And I agree with Councilmember Desai. We don't know what our number is. We're going to appeal.\nSpeaker 1: It might be different. We might be successful in that appeal. We shouldn't be deciding what that density is now and for the reasons he's argued. There's really as I'm listening to the conversation, I feel like I've put you in a difficult position.\nSpeaker 1: I'm asking you to make decisions. And before you've been through a year long planning process with the community about what they're going to be comfortable with. Here's the one thing that is just driving us around this issue. And I just to put it in context, we cannot afford to have disagreements at the very end like the consequences\nSpeaker 1: , because the state law is like we have a deadline. Like if we miss that deadline, we immediately start paying penalties so we can't afford a disagreement. I don't need to convince Councilmember de SAG tonight. I need to convince all five of you over the next year that we've got a good plan to accommodate whatever arena we have\nSpeaker 1: . So at this point, you know, I feel like we're going a little bit beyond where we need to go. And I guess I just really I'm hoping that what I'm hearing from Councilmember De Saag is, look, we're going to get a housing element adopted.\nSpeaker 1: We're going to do what's necessary to get it adopted. We're certainly you know, that's what I'm hoping we all are in agreement on. But we're going to reserve judgment as to where we should do density and how high that density is until we actually see the numbers and we see how it plays out.\nSpeaker 1: If the council wants to set an absolute cap and absolute sort of ceiling on how we do this and really constrain the process over the next year, well, we will certainly work with that. I just wouldn't advise it.\nSpeaker 0: And I am just going to say I am really adamant that I cannot imagine that we would vote not to adopt a housing element that doesn't comply with state law. So please just keep that in mind, because I don't care how special.\nSpeaker 2: We are.\nSpeaker 0: As an island or what have you. A state law. A state law. And the penalties are steep for not complying with it. Councilmember Herrera Spencer, I think your next. Still muted. Okay. Try. Yeah, I know that. Double unmute.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I wanted to ask you. I appreciate the conversation. I personally I don't know. When I look at it, I'll just say the willows. I don't know what their density is. And maybe if you can give us some examples as we're going through this process of what density is for some of these places, what the square footage\nSpeaker 2: is of the units. I and and I do agree in regards. But the mayor is saying I do want to do and I've that I've spoken back when I was mayor and now same thing of affordability by design.\nSpeaker 2: I'm very unhappy with the pricing out at the point. I think that is a failure. I do not think it supports the majority. And, you know, our meetings, most of us at least people I know and hang out with.\nSpeaker 2: We can't write a check for over $1,000,000 and most of that housing salvia out there is over $1,000,000. So that, in my opinion, is a gift to the community. It is a gift to the community. And we need to try to figure out a way to come up with housing that people can actually buy and not have\nSpeaker 2: to pay rent for the rest of their lives. This is a serious problem. But, you know, house mob as a unit have to be to bring down to the point, the price point. And that to me is a legitimate question.\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Okay. That's build a 200 square foot home. Is that right? $2,200 a year for the home to run. I'm going to say let's build a 200 tiny house. And then as my developers still going to put a $1 million price tag on it because of so and this is not working and we have a serious problem\nSpeaker 2: . We have to come up with a way to work with some developer that can actually build housing to buy that comes in significantly under $1,000,000. But we are doing to our cities, I believe is we're doing gentrification and we're seeing this all over.\nSpeaker 2: And I know a lot of people don't like that word, but that's the reality. If I can't buy a home and mice in Alameda, $400 million and you can look at the prices for houses that have, you know, are from the turn of the century and new homes, if you look at what is the lowest priced home\nSpeaker 2: you can buy. And I think that is significant. That is how generations can acquire equity. And I am a renter. And just so you all know, and I used to be a member, Odie and I are the two renters.\nSpeaker 2: And so I think at this point I'm the runner up here. I'm a renter, long term runner in Alameda, can't pay $1,000,000 for a home. So I do want I'm interested in looking at these different densities to see that I needed to actually be reflected in the price points to purchase.\nSpeaker 2: And sadly, I don't think that actually happened as much as we tried out at the point. Right. We tried I tried to get a condo overlay and, you know, we end up still everything's over $1,000,000. So, you know, but I do want to you know, I'm I'm interested in trying to be flexible and trying to make this\nSpeaker 2: work. So I wanted to share that. I appreciate having the opportunity to say that. And I actually part of my proposal was to strike reference to SNL terminals within this document. That project I have not put my name on yet.\nSpeaker 2: I may not put my name on it. I'm happy to have the developer here that I am still trying to negotiate. And so I don't think it's appropriate to put that in here and let a developer know, oh, he's already got the four votes for the swap.\nSpeaker 2: There was already, as is referenced in the document, a plan that was approved without the swap. And so they have a plan that they could be proceeding on if they want to have the developer say, oh, it's not viable for me.\nSpeaker 2: Was that made is not viable for you or someone to build and charge over $1,000,000. So how much money you're making? And honestly, when we have these discussions, I don't know how much money developers actually really make. I never get to see their books.\nSpeaker 2: I don't actually know what the real costs are. I don't know what their real revenue is. So I just have to look at the end product and say, okay, but for me, a plan was already approved for and SNL, they haven't built it.\nSpeaker 2: That's on them. They want the swap. They're going to have to negotiate for four votes. And my any reference to them in this, I think suggests that they already have the four, in which case that hurts my ability and anyone else, any other council members ability to try to negotiate.\nSpeaker 2: And they did come to count the prior to the prior council and did not get the four votes. But my, my recollection is at least number matter I see. And I maybe member Desai I'm not sure who was sitting on there at the time was not interested in what they were offering.\nSpeaker 2: So that's why I had omitted those references. Also just speak to that so people and are in all honesty with it, where I came from in trying to support this effort, I think you.\nSpeaker 0: Can just to reference back to the internal terminal site, there is a difference between properties that require four votes to approve and three votes to approve. And so it's it's not so much a matter of signaling to the developer.\nSpeaker 0: I think, you know, we we most of us talk to these folks. But if we are told by the state that we have to build some housing, whether it's 2650 or 53, 50 or some other number, it's got to go somewhere.\nSpeaker 0: And if we can't use this site, if we can't get it reconfigured, it is what it is, we will look elsewhere. But I think that to the principle that Mr. Thomas raised, is it do we approve using, to the extent possible, vacant, underused land?\nSpeaker 0: I, I think that has a place in this discussion. Anybody else want to weigh in on this? I think I feel like three of us carrying much of this conversation. Councilor Knox White Vice Mayor Vella. Counselor and that's why I got.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm going to go back to I have not heard. A broad commitment for what an MF overlay looks like so far. I've heard Tony say Councilmember de Sung Save MF 30. I understand that we need some flexibility.\nSpeaker 3: I don't know that we need to build that build the house exactly right now. But I'm going to be very uncomfortable moving forward using an MF overlay if they're a majority of the council that does not include me, doesn't say that we're going to use the MF overlay and we're going to be flexible with it.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm going to be really clear that, well, you know, I agree with everything Councilmember Spencer just said about housing, but I would say that the housing policies that are being pushed, including the appeal that was just filed, are the reason that the costs are what they are.\nSpeaker 3: Our housing authority is spending $1,000,000 per unit to build housing units. That's the cost to build the units. You can make 200 that one 200 square foot homes somewhere in Alameda. They are not going to sell for $400,000.\nSpeaker 3: They're going to still be extremely expensive. That's what happens. The cheap the cheap houses that exist in Alameda are the old houses. The new houses are never cheap, but we're not building new houses. So we haven't been able to filter down the houses the way that traditionally that that kind of affordable stuff goes.\nSpeaker 3: So, you know, if we can't build if we can't build denser housing and we can't build it cheaper with in places where, you know, where there is already the infrastructure to build it, then we're going to end up continuing to make sure that every single unit we build is going to be in that one point whatever million\nSpeaker 3: dollars. I mean, it's ridiculous. I couldn't afford to live in the city anymore. I, I am very lucky to own my home. I could not live in the city today if we had not bought in 20 years ago.\nSpeaker 3: So, you know, I am. Thankful and aware of that privilege. But I also am very aware that it is a privilege, and my goal is to try to stop the problem that's happening so that other people can have the privilege as well.\nSpeaker 3: So for me, I would like to know that there is more to me. So I'm going to as one of the co-chairs for the measures the campaign. I feel that our Councilmember de sa notwithstanding I feel that what we heard from our voters very clearly was they want us to limit housing to the greatest extent possible in\nSpeaker 3: Alameda. And they want us to honor our charter. And I feel that I am in a very difficult place whereby if I vote to violate our charter, I am just ignoring the community who just voted on the question I ask them.\nSpeaker 3: And so for me, I will be honoring the voters. And I'm aware that that may cause us to be noncompliant, which I think will be terrible. And I also think it will be okay if we end up in court and there will be some pain.\nSpeaker 3: But I think that we will finally have a long term answer to the question that keeps getting asked. But everybody continue to pass. Counsels have ducked it every single turn. The MF overlay isn't some magic thing that the state developed to say, Here's how you get around your stuff.\nSpeaker 3: It's something that staff came up with, with How can we sell ignoring our charter based on some stuff from, you know, they they pulled laws and calculations from state, but it wasn't something magical. It's not a it's not a state thing.\nSpeaker 3: It's something that Andrew Thomas and John Russo came up with. And we're able to pitch and sell to the to the council ten years ago. And, you know, nobody fought it because they understood Measure eight is illegal. This is a way for us to pretend that we're addressing it now.\nSpeaker 3: We're in a place where the only way for us to address that is a multifamily overlay that goes well over 30 units to the acre or else all the angry emails, hundreds of them that we have gotten from Bay Farm are going to get a response with sorry, we're sticking with 30.\nSpeaker 3: And guess what? It's not just your shopping center, it's your actual housing areas that are going to start getting this MF overlay as well, because we're going to have to be everywhere. But, you know, right now, you know, I don't feel comfortable being a being the vote who ignores, you know, being being one of the votes who\nSpeaker 3: just, you know, ignores the voters. So, you know, I think we really you know, for me, I'm looking for for four or five votes saying we're going to be very flexible, that we understand that an overlay is going to be more than 30 units in the acre in some places.\nSpeaker 3: And that we're encouraging, you know, really going on the record saying, staff, we want you to work on this because I'm really worried about what's going to happen six months from now when we come back. And the staff has got 80 units, the acre on Park Street because they're all really small little Watson.\nSpeaker 3: That's the only way to make it work. And everybody flicks out and says, but that's more than 30 and we're going to be noncompliant. And again, I'm okay with being noncompliant. I'm not happy about it. But I believe that it is at least one way to be ethically and morally aligned with the question I asked the community\nSpeaker 3: last fall. I'm not saying that's the only way I think other people can make other equally ethical and moral decisions. But I want to be really clear that I'm not going to be a part of a majority. That is Vice Mayor Avella and Mayor Izzy Ashcraft that rams through MF Overlays all over the place and kind of\nSpeaker 3: , you know, sorry. I mean, that, you know.\nSpeaker 0: You I know you're not making ad hominem attacks on you.\nSpeaker 2: I'm not I'm.\nSpeaker 3: Saying that that the comment was made, somebody has to be the adult in the room. And I think sometimes the adults in the room have to carry this while other people, you know, say, well, I'm not going to do that.\nSpeaker 3: And I think at this point in time, our full council needs to be the adult in the room and that I'm going to be I'm happy to join it. The council being the adult in the room, but I'm not going to be a part of a three vote adults in the room on this issue right now, even\nSpeaker 3: if that means that ultimately we're, you know, ending up in court, that with the state about it. So.\nSpeaker 0: Well, okay, we could just table this discussion for now because it doesn't seem like we're going to get a four or five vote majority on anything, if that's what you're looking for. I mean it con the vice mayor because she hasn't spoken much as evidenced by her 13 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: You could just you know.\nSpeaker 2: I'm not planning this fever soliloquy. So, you know, look, I do have concerns. We are fiduciary. And I understand. I think one of the biggest problems with the state of California is that we have allowed kind of a ridiculous amount of zoning via the ballot box, which has resulted in the conundrum that we are faced with tonight\nSpeaker 2: . And I to Councilmember Knox white point. It's not a majority of the voters. It was a majority of the people who turned out to vote and in specific elections have made kind of decisions that have said the city of Alameda does not want to comply with this, that or the other or this is what we're going to\nSpeaker 2: do. And we're going to limit the ability to actually have local control and have project by project decision making. That is based off of a number of different things we have kind of allowed for. And by we I don't just mean the city of Alameda.\nSpeaker 2: I mean many jurisdictions through these different measures have kind of, you know, limited local control, limited the ability of elected councils to make real time decisions on projects through measures that have been put in place decades prior. So, you know, I think that that's part of the issue that we're faced with.\nSpeaker 2: I don't think that Alameda is unique in it, not a mayor and I sit on a statewide committee and we we hear these arguments about uniqueness from all over the state of California. And lots of different jurisdictions have exclusionary zoning provisions or provisions that limit certain amounts of whether it be density or other sorts of type of\nSpeaker 2: construction. So I you know, what I am concerned with, though, is we are fiduciary is we do have conflicting obligations here. So I think one of the things that I would like to hear about are what are our options from the city attorney's perspective that that we're faced with?\nSpeaker 2: You know, I understand that we have the resolution before us tonight. I also understand from Mr. Thomas that we don't necessarily have to make a decision tonight. But I do think it's important to have a conversation about what all the options are.\nSpeaker 2: And I certainly want to avoid you know, I don't necessarily want to cause or push a lawsuit to be filed against. The city one way or the other. But I do think that we have to address the elephant in the room.\nSpeaker 2: And I am concerned, like I said, about this legacy of of zoning via the ballot box that has caused these limitations.\nSpeaker 0: And I am going to have to interrupt at this minute because we have to do some housekeeping. I am certain to tell you that it's almost 11:00 and the city clerk reminds me that we must make a motion by 11 p.m. so we can deliberate for very long to consider the new items, which are six F that's\nSpeaker 0: the Greenway Golf and gyms on the course lease amendments. And and then there's those two items that were pulled from the consent calendar. Now, one option would be to only hear city staff and continue the consent items to a specific date and time.\nSpeaker 0: Since we've already heard public comment on them, I am more than willing to go up to midnight for as far as we can get. I hope that we can get to the Greenway item because there's a settlement agreement that kind of hangs in the balance on that one.\nSpeaker 0: So measure, measure, motion to keep going until 11, but to definitely start Greenway Golf next. And then if we get to the consent calendar items.\nSpeaker 2: You know.\nSpeaker 0: Midnight hasn't come yet, we'll do those otherwise they get continued to I think a date certain which would be our next council meeting. And it's 1045. 1049. Councilmember not.\nSpeaker 3: I move to continue the meeting. Past 11:00.\nSpeaker 2: Which new items you're considering?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, we have to. We have to. If we don't make this decision by 11, this is the last one we'll hear.\nSpeaker 3: Now, I understand, but we can just continue to hear new items after 11. I don't have to identify which ones.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you just have to say which new. I, I think the rules of order or specific enough that you have to identify that item. Let me read you that. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Of all the outstanding items we can here at and before midnight.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. A quick second and then a quick roll call vote. That's very valid seconds. We have a real cover place.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember De Sang?\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Career Center. No. Knox, right. Yes. Yes. Mayor as Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: That carries way forward.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Perfect. Thank you, everyone.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Back to Vice Mayor Vallee. You had.\nSpeaker 2: The floor. So I would like to hear from our city attorney physically on kind of our fiduciary obligations and our obligations relative to this. And I also I agree that there needs to be some sort of. At least attempt at unanimity relative to the IMF overlay.\nSpeaker 2: And I would like to also hear from our city attorney and city staff relative to approaches towards that.\nSpeaker 0: And possibly also the implications of not being in not having a housing element that complies with state law. Okay. Where should we start with city attorney? Don't all rest and you go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: I'm happy to answer some of your questions, Vice Mayor Vela and Council Members. So I think the one important thing to remember is that there is no. Now that you've decided the appeal, there's no pressing deadline tonight. The housing element does not need to be certified till the end of next year.\nSpeaker 1: So you do have time. The planning director has informed you that he's going to he has a path and he's working on it. He'll bring it back to you and he'll continue to keep you planning board and the community updated.\nSpeaker 1: So I think one option is for the council to simply continue this item and allow the planning director to bring back new information. And he's going to get them because he's going to tell you whether our appeal is successful and whether our arena numbers change and that might inform your conversation.\nSpeaker 1: So I actually think that may not be a bad place to be to just let our planning director do the work with the community. You could take any number of other actions. You can make commitments about doing multifamily overlays tonight.\nSpeaker 1: You can make commitments about prioritizing city owned land tonight. You can make none of those commitments tonight. All of that is fine. You can make commitments in the opposite direction. You couldn't, you know, harden the position and direct us to litigate.\nSpeaker 1: You certainly, certainly don't have to do that tonight as well. And I would recommend that if you want us to talk about litigation, that you direct us to bring you to talk about it in closed session and not in the open.\nSpeaker 1: And so there is a wide range of options before you and you have a lot of time. And so my recommendation is that you let Mr. Thomas do a little more work and come back to you in a few months with an update.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Sheahan. If I could slip in a question to Mr. Thomas. Do you have any idea about when we could anticipate hearing back regarding the appeal? I know the deadline is July 9th. I'm sure there are other cities appealing idea and.\nSpeaker 1: We've I'm sorry. And I should have looked that up before tonight's meeting for some reason, I believe, by the end of the calendar year. I would be wrong about that. And I will follow up with a, you know, email to council in the next day or two.\nSpeaker 1: But for some reason I remember reading about this and thinking it was, you know, by the end of this calendar year or early, it could be early beginning of next year. In terms of.\nSpeaker 0: What. Yeah, I you know, it as I say, I am just.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 0: Just pulled out my airbag, general assembly binder. And do you want me to give you a quick overview of the timeline? Sure you do. Okay. The what is the anticipated? If he'll schedule. Okay. We know that the deadline is in July.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then the. Oh, yeah. At the end by the end of August. That's the deadline for jurisdictions to comment on appeals submitted about notifies jurisdictions in each case about comments received September and October about context, public hearings to consider appeals and comments will notify jurisdictions 25 days prior to hearing.\nSpeaker 0: October, November Eric ratifies final determination on each appeal and issues final re allocations that include adjustments resulting from successful appeals. And then November or December 18, Executive Board can text public hearing to adopt final arena plan. So you're right end of the year.\nSpeaker 1: And just in terms of sequencing the work, I mean, the way we are approaching this and what we've just been describing to the planning board and to the community is sort of a a a series of steps we'll play out over the next nine months.\nSpeaker 1: And where it starts, we know we have 1500 units or thereabouts already approved in approved projects. So now they are game plan. We're very close to being wrapping things up on internal terminals. The planning board has finished its work.\nSpeaker 1: We're still working through negotiating some items within some terminals. So our plan would be to be back to you in the very near future on that project so that you can evaluate that separately and decide is it going into the basket or not.\nSpeaker 1: You can vote it up or down. If you vote it up, then that adds 589 units to our 1500. Then our plan was to come back in September with a conversation on Alameda Point because we want to know how many units we can start planning for and made a point and putting into that basket.\nSpeaker 1: And then we will know. I'm hoping by then, by the end of the year, we'll know, okay, how many units do we have approved in projects? And so Alameda point and everything else. And what's our arena final arena.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's our gap? And it's that gap that's going to we need to fill with MFW overlay. That's one we're going to really be able to get into the specifics. And that's when I think for the questions that Councilmember de SOG was asking, I think every member of your community is asking that same question where the multifamily\nSpeaker 1: overlay is going to be, how dense are they going to be? And it's hard to answer that question until we know what's the final number. So I, I see a series of meetings with the council over the next nine months, starting with specific project kind of meetings where you make decisions about projects and then following as we\nSpeaker 1: come down the homestretch decisions and direction about map overlays, where to put them, what kind of density is necessary, obviously with the input not just from staff but also from your planning board. And I think through that process, as the city attorney was saying, it allows us to keep moving through the process, to keep the council informed\nSpeaker 1: . So the council to be giving us feedback throughout this process. We just don't want any surprises at the end. At the end it's got to be smooth because, you know, that's when it'll be a shame to spend all this time and effort with the community and the planning board and all of you and then not be successful\nSpeaker 1: at the end.\nSpeaker 0: So and I'd just like to say something because the issue of the. Oh, Vice Mayor Vella, did I like on your comments? No. Okay. On the issue of the measures, the ballot measure has come up a couple of times and we're reading a lot into the election results.\nSpeaker 0: And I do agree that it was a resounding no. But I want to say a couple of things. The one of them is that I don't think it was a well-run campaign and I was the co-chair, but I've run successful campaigns before.\nSpeaker 0: And one of the things that you really have to do and we didn't do adequately in this one hardly at all, is to educate your voters. And so when I hear Mr. Thomas talking about the public process that will ensue going forward, this is what we should have been doing all along.\nSpeaker 0: And for a number of reasons. We made the decision as a council kind of late in the game to put it on the ballot. So we didn't have some of the the time that you would like to to inform people, your voters answer their questions to the point that Councilmember Herrera Spencer raised.\nSpeaker 0: What does what do these different densities look like? I mean. Mr. Thomas has a brilliant hand out. We used it at a number of presentations, but I don't I just don't think enough people really had a chance because that was the other thing.\nSpeaker 0: I think we did too much of talking, preaching to the converted. We talk to each other, the ones who think like us. You got to get out and really hear what people's concerns are. What are we going to do?\nSpeaker 0: We need to build all this housing, we're told, but how are we going to get people on and off the island? Fair point. Good questions. And you know what? We have a lot of good answers to, but we we fell short of communicating that.\nSpeaker 0: So here is our chance to have a do over, if you will, to do a better job of bringing the public along. Hopefully the council, too. But I think that we just we can't pretend there's not a housing crisis and that we need to address it.\nSpeaker 0: But I do think there's some better ways forward. But, you know, at the end of the day, we need to spend a lot of time solving these problems and we cannot and we have to solve them realistically. We can't say nothing higher than two stories anywhere.\nSpeaker 0: We can't do that. But there's you know, there'll be time for that conversation. It's probably not tonight, I think maybe we've got as far as we can go. But what I would like is for council to give Mr. Thomas some clear direction about the kind of things you would like included in his staff report.\nSpeaker 0: When he comes back to us sometime after our break. I would imagine it is not going to be at the last meeting in July. Trust me, that will be a full agenda. But council what what are the kinds of things do you want to be sure to have addressed?\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Dysart, may I start with you? Because you had some well.\nSpeaker 1: You know, I just put together a statement because I just want to be clear as to where I stand and this is how I feel. And it goes like this. Is it okay?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah, I got you.\nSpeaker 1: Before I sign off on our housing element and multifamily zoning strategies, I first need to know what our final arena allocation is and determine if that is a that is fair to our island. Second, the public and council needs a thorough analysis regarding densities of new general plan land use categories and their relationship to multifamily overlays.\nSpeaker 1: If there is no substantial budge from the current 5300 arena allocation, I could find it very difficult supporting any kind of housing element or zoning overlay change that puts into effect an unfair arena allocation at the end of the day.\nSpeaker 1: We are unique. We are one of two incorporated cities in California that are islands. Coronado is the other and as such we can't support anything near the current 5300 arena allocation. You know, between now and when Planning Director Thomas puts together his is a report that that mayor as you referenced, you know, I'm more than happy to\nSpeaker 1: , you know, put out my thoughts even more to help him, you know, kind of see where how I'm looking at things. But but that's how I feel right now. I need to know the allocation now before we signing off on multifamily zoning strategies or housing element compliance.\nSpeaker 0: So Councilmember decide, do you prefer that this item not come back to us until after the November or December determination of our appeal?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Other council members. What do you think? Vice mayor, go ahead and mute this.\nSpeaker 2: I think it makes sense to wait until after we get a response. But I do think that there are a number of questions that we are going to have to answer as a council that are fairly you know, I mean, once we get a response, I do think that especially if in anticipating that the response is not\nSpeaker 2: necessarily going to be an agreement to our appeal, I think there are some some heavier, bigger decisions that are going to be coming before the council that will need to be made.\nSpeaker 0: And, yes.\nSpeaker 2: Such as all of the questions that have been raised that I've raised that you, Madam Mayor, have raised that that all of this could be raised. I think we are going to have to make a decision about the multifamily overlay.\nSpeaker 2: We are going to have to make decisions about where where the units go and what the density actually looks like. But I do think to your point, Madam Mayor, there are other cities that are grappling with these same things.\nSpeaker 2: The city of Berkeley certainly is looking at its its own exclusionary zoning provisions and the impact on its housing element. I do think that there needs to be robust conversation with the public. I think this is an issue that can get very confusing for people, and a lot of it is about really visualizing what that density looks\nSpeaker 2: like and what it means for our city and what it means for various neighborhoods. And I think we have a lot of high opportunity neighborhoods in the city of Alameda. We need to make sure that we're looking at that.\nSpeaker 2: And really, I hope that when we make the decision and we have this conversation about our housing element, we really center our priorities relative. We have stated for the Council about making sure that we are addressing our housing needs and really centering equity in that conversation.\nSpeaker 2: So I think there's going to be a robust conversation for us to have. A when we have that conversation, I'm going to certainly be coming at it from that lens and also really wanting to find a way to work things out and not necessarily, you know, I want to approve a housing element that I want to create\nSpeaker 2: a housing element that is compliant. So I think that's really important that we find a way to do that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Who else wants to make suggestions? Okay. I'm seeing your hands going up. Mr. Thomas, to you. Oh, do you want to just tell us briefly? And I know it's after 11, and we need to get to our next item, but you just want to tell us briefly the repercussions of not having a housing element that\nSpeaker 0: complies with state law?\nSpeaker 1: Well, we yes. So if we missed the deadline for submitting a compliant housing element, we will immediately be cut off from a whole range of state funding sources. So that's just the state can just turn them off. You are no longer eligible.\nSpeaker 1: Only only cities that have are in compliance with housing law are eligible to even apply for these grants. For example, we've got a $2 million grant for Jeanne Swinney, but that was only because we had certified our housing element.\nSpeaker 1: We couldn't have either applied for it if we hadn't done it. So that just happens automatically. And it's about transportation money. It's open space money, it's affordable housing money, it's homeless money. It's we rely on all sorts of those funding.\nSpeaker 1: So that immediately happens right off the bat the day we fail.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, so that's the bad news. The good news is we don't have to submit that until when?\nSpeaker 1: January 2023.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: So what I would like to do is I would like to come back to you in the fall with what there's projects. So they're not about the housing element, but they certainly affect the housing element. And you can vote them up or you can vote them down.\nSpeaker 1: But we will be making very clear, like if you vote them up, we get to count them in our housing element. If you vote them down, we can't. The other thing will be coming back to you in the fall is the general plan.\nSpeaker 1: The general plan is designed to set up and support a housing element, but not predetermine whether it's going to be 5300 or 2600. It's a general plan. For the next 20 years, there will be three housing cycles that occur during the next 20 years.\nSpeaker 1: So it's not trying to predetermine that. It's allowing the decisions about map overlay and density to occur as part of the housing element, not as part of this. I think then what happens by the end of the fall?\nSpeaker 1: We hear from Arena and then you see me back. I'll keep working with the planning board and the community on these MF overlays over the next six months. But we will come back to the Council for an update study session, sort of similar to this report on our final arena, like, okay, here's the actual number.\nSpeaker 1: And here's what we think we need to do in terms of EMF overlays and what the planning board thinks we should be doing. That will be in January, February. That still gives us. You know, eight, nine months to keep working on it.\nSpeaker 1: Fine tuning it, adjusting it. So we won't need you to approve it that night. We'll just need you to give us some feedback and the kind of feedback I'm anticipating, like maybe a little bit too many units over here.\nSpeaker 1: A little bit. You can do a little bit more over there. Can we lower the density on that site? Maybe increase it over here a little bit. That kind of fine tuning.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for that input and just something that I'd like to to have. And I certainly second what my colleague Mary Vella said is that I think now that we're knock on wood moving out of the worst of COVID and we just done remarkably well in its vaccines and we're starting to open up a little more.\nSpeaker 0: Maybe you could take that show on the road in the not too distant future. I would like to see workshops taking place in different parts of the city, making it accessible. I mean, I know there's these kinds of meetings, but I'd actually like to go out, maybe some walking tours.\nSpeaker 0: You've you've done that in the past that I think have been really very instructive. And so I know there is some, you know, creative ways that we may be able to help educate the communities so they understand, you know, what are our challenges, what are the ways that we might be able to to meet these challenges?\nSpeaker 0: So that would be my ask. So thank you all for your time, your thoughtful input. It is appreciated. And so with that, we're going to just continue this item to not to a date certain that you will come back to us when you feel that the time is right to to raise these issues with us.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you so much. Staff and counsel. Okay. We're going to close this item now and we are going to rapidly move to item six. Asked Madam Clerk if you could, I know you're multitasking there.\nSpeaker 2: And for your people. I have got an introduction of ordinance approving a Third Amendment to the Greenway Golf Lease Agreement for operation of the Creek Park Complex. This requires four votes and recommendation to authorize the city manager to execute the Third Amendment to the Jim's On the Course Concessionaire Agreement for food and Beverage Services at the Creek\n",

The housing element.\nSpeaker 1: 912 is a report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and confirm the proposed 2021 2029 General Plan Housing Element Citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Great. So I know we have a staff presentation.\nSpeaker 1: I know I'm there for the day. I'd like to introduce the planning manager, Patricia Defender, for who will lead this presentation along with other members of the development services team.\nSpeaker 0: Great. We'll give them a few seconds to get set up over there. Whenever you're ready.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Vice Mayor. Council members. Thank you and good evening. My name is Patricia Defender, her the planning bureau manager. I'll be providing this presentation on the Planning Bureau's efforts to update the city's housing element as required by state law.\nSpeaker 2: The Council is not being asked to adopt the proposed plan this evening, but rather to confirm the policy direction of the plan so that staff can resubmit this revised plan to the State Housing Department for its review. I'll provide more information on that process later in the presentation.\nSpeaker 2: So staff has provided many different presentations to the City Council on Housing related topics as some of these earlier slides I'm going to go through more quickly. As you know, the housing element is one of many required elements of the general plan.\nSpeaker 2: It assesses the condition of the city's housing and housing needs of its residents. It establishes a roadmap for accommodating projected housing unit demand for existing and future residents. And it sets the city wide goals, objectives and policies for housing.\nSpeaker 2: It must be updated every eight years and submitted to the state for its review and certification. And one of the main objectives of the plan is to remove barriers to housing production and to help ensure that the city is planning for its fair share of affordable and market rate housing.\nSpeaker 2: Staff has been working on the update to this housing element since early 2020 and has conducted both extensive technical analysis and community engagement. Staff released an initial draft of the plan on July 20, 2021, the year before for the public review and submitted it to the state as well.\nSpeaker 2: And just as a point of note, the housing element is one of the most regulated of all. The general plan elements by the state and the city must obtain certification for the housing element from CDD to be compliant with state law.\nSpeaker 2: This slide summarizes that the public outreach and engagement that was conducted for this plan, a great deal of public engagement was conducted largely virtual outreach as COVID hit during the early surge or process of the of this planning process.\nSpeaker 2: So it limited the in-person outreach that we could do. Many of the types of activities related to outreach included virtual workshops, including Spanish workshops, multilingual focus groups, community meetings there, a virtual open house on the website that allowed people to provide input.\nSpeaker 2: And this is just on this slide kind of summarizes many of the different efforts as well as this incorporating the feedback of other recent housing related efforts to inform the plan. This slide just shows the different components of the housing element.\nSpeaker 2: Much of this is prescribed and required by state law and the housing. The draft before you does include all of these different components. The next several slides describe the current state of housing in the city and some of the challenges around that are around housing.\nSpeaker 2: Much of this this information and data has been shared with the council over time. So I'm just going to go over very quickly. Basically, this slide talks about the fact that 43% of all long beach households are housing cost burdened, and that means that they pay too much for their rent or their mortgage and the even the\nSpeaker 2: higher paying jobs. The average salary of more well-paying jobs in the city do not. Provide income sufficient to pay for the average rents in the city, which is nearly 9000 dollars. Nor too high for purchasing a home in the city.\nSpeaker 2: This provides information on how different races are affected by the current constraints of the city's housing market. Long Beach has long been a majority renter city for a number of decades. 2160 1% of the households rent their homes.\nSpeaker 2: The chart on the left shows that people of color are more likely to be renters. For example, 80% of black households rent in Long Beach. Similarly, the chart on the right shows those that are the division between those who rant and those who own by race.\nSpeaker 2: And black homeowners are one of the smallest group. Groups of homeowners with four out of five households renting, which we've seen typically means greater housing insecurity. This slide just shows how population has increased at a greater rate than housing units, and this has contributed to a lack of supply.\nSpeaker 2: And they are also on the right. The graph shows that the housing stock of the city is a very old and aging housing stock, with much of its housing being 30 and even 50 years old. And of course, all of these conditions have contributed to overcrowding in the city and there's significant overcrowding in the city.\nSpeaker 2: And Black, Latino and Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Long Beach all have higher overcrowding rates as compared to the L.A. County. And almost a quarter over a quarter of Latino residents have lived in overcrowded conditions. This has been particularly challenging during COVID, where more people are staying at home and people are both working and children are\nSpeaker 2: attending school at home. And that was much of what we heard in our outreach. This next slide just shows the rent levels that are would be affordable to people at different income levels based on the L.A. County median income.\nSpeaker 2: So you can see by these rent levels, by income level and by size of the units, the number of bedrooms that units or rents are unaffordable to many in the city. They're unaffordable to low income and even some moderate income households, because as you recall, the average rents was about 1900 dollars a month.\nSpeaker 2: This slide just shows summarizes how the city did in terms of achieving its arena. In the last cycle, in the last eight years, the city added fewer than 4000 housing units and only met 60% of its affordable rent requirements.\nSpeaker 2: And the new arena is going to be challenging and requires many strategies because it is significantly greater than that of the last cycle. This slide does show the reasons for this upcoming cycle. It is 26,000 units. It is nearly almost four times greater than the arena of the last cycle.\nSpeaker 2: And almost 60% of the units must be affordable. As you may recall, that staff provided a presentation on the site inventory and the methodology related to the site inventory. Back in April of this year. An important and required part of updating the housing element is to develop a site to develop a site inventory.\nSpeaker 2: The site inventory identified sites that meet specific criteria and can be developed with housing in the future. It is again required by state law as a way for the city to demonstrate that it has the sufficient capacity and its zoning to accommodate the arena.\nSpeaker 2: Just as a reminder, the the EU provided the framework for the site inventory and all the sites identified on the map assume densities that are consistent with their place type designation in the elderly. And just again, you know, our staff had described the methodology which involved applying uniform criteria to all parcels of the city to identify sites\nSpeaker 2: that are under-used based on their zoning and or their place type designation and therefore have a higher likelihood of being developed with housing in the near future. The map shown here on the left represents the results from the site inventory, the latest results, which has been refined a little bit.\nSpeaker 2: That has largely stayed the same since that April presentation. So the next few slides are just going to talk a little bit more about the site inventory. You may recall that staff prepared two different scenarios. One scenario was the number of units that can be accommodated given the current zoning of the city.\nSpeaker 2: Under the current zoning, using the Uniform Code criteria that were applied citywide, there is insufficient zoning capacity to meet the Rena and that it only results in less than 15,000 units. With the ability to take credit for pipeline projects and to use the the current zoning scenario is still about 10,000 units short of what is needed.\nSpeaker 2: So as we have discussed over time, since the city can't meet the Rena using the existing zoning, the city has to commit to rezoning properties consistent with the AUV within 1 to 3 years. In order to to meet the Rena.\nSpeaker 2: And I'll explain a little bit more about the laws and how the laws have changed recently. The place type scenario is the other scenario that was prepared. It's fortunate for the city that the city had already adopted the land use element, which plans for which plan for additional growth and provides a road map for the necessary rezoning\nSpeaker 2: to accommodate the Rena and will enable the city to rezone within the prescribed period of time. Since most properties in the city have not yet been rezone to implement, the levy staff has developed the second scenario to demonstrate how once rezoning does occur, the the number the the Rena can be accommodated by the plan.\nSpeaker 2: So with the plan, with the place type scenario, the there are about approximately 28,000, a little more than 28,000 units that can be accommodated, adding the pipeline, an ADU that brings the the unit count to about 30,000 and that does provide a nearly 4000 unit or 15% buffer, which is going to be important for the city as\nSpeaker 2: it implements the housing element. So this next table just summarizes the the information that was provided in the previous few slides. So the final results, the site inventory for us are shown here for both the existing zoning and the place tip scenarios.\nSpeaker 2: You can see the first highlighted row under the current zoning scenario and shows how the zoning is not sufficient that ultimately the place type scenario is insufficient to meet the Rena. The next number of slides are going to provide an overview of the major components of the proposed plan, organized by eight major recurring themes to demonstrate how\nSpeaker 2: the plan addresses and responds to community feedback and identify priorities and input from the State Housing Department. The first major theme Steph heard was that there's not enough housing available in Long Beach as was demonstrated by the data.\nSpeaker 2: So this slide shows some of the key strategies of the plan to address this. This issue and a primary strategy is the city wide geographic rezoning program, which will implement value and create more capacity for housing. And the the the plan planning process and the process to update zoning in the Anaheim corridor are some examples of those\nSpeaker 2: efforts. The next major theme was the need for more affordable housing. This is something that we heard consistently throughout the outreach. The proposed plan includes many policies and programs designed to help address this issue. They're shown here on the slide identifying additional funding sources, local funding sources for affordable housing.\nSpeaker 2: The Mixed Income US Development Strategy from the Enhanced Density Bonus Ordinance that was recently adopted and the inclusionary housing program are also important strategies, as is preserving existing affordable units. Another theme that was heard consistently throughout the outreach was the need for housing assistance because housing is unaffordable to so many residents in the city.\nSpeaker 2: Housing assistance is critical for many housing vouchers known as Section eight. Vouchers are in much greater demand than what the city is able to provide. So providing oriented housing vouchers to people with the greatest need and looking for flexible funding pool to provide more vouchers.\nSpeaker 2: Continuing to provide the emergency rental assistance through the COVID relief and beyond are some of the strategies outlined in the plan. Okay. So the next slide is about moderate income housing, the need for moderate income housing and for there are a number of policies and programs in the presentation or sorry in the plan pardon me that try\nSpeaker 2: to address this issue of the enhanced density bonus ordinance is among them and it does provide some incentives, particularly for moderate income units. Those incentives are much more attractive to the local density bonus than they are at the state level to encourage moderate income units.\nSpeaker 2: And the inclusionary requirement has an ownership option for moderate income zoning code updates and implementation of the land use element in some of the lower density zones to encourage more housing types and duplexes. And Triplexes, for example, are also among the strategies for increasing the amount of moderate income housing and facilitating through those efforts as well, and\nSpeaker 2: looking at new zoning typologies, facilitating naturally occurring affordable housing typologies like the bungalows and courtyard apartments, which are housing types that are commonly found in the city. And home ownership and down payment assistance are among the programs in the plan that are also intended to.\nSpeaker 2: Generate more moderate income, housing and ownership of moderate income housing. The next slide is related to anti displacement strategies and tenant protections in the plan. This is something that I've heard a great deal about during the planning process, and programs to support this goal include the enhanced no net loss requirements of the local density bonus ordinance that\nSpeaker 2: was adopted recently, which exceeds the no net loss requirements of the state and development of an ordinance to regulate substantial remodels is something that is also underway to allow the remodels in a manner that does not that minimizes displacement.\nSpeaker 2: Community members also underscored the importance of eviction protection strategies like tenant right to counsel. The revised draft plan expands the Tenant Rights Council program and reflects the additional resources that were allocated to this program through by the City Council in the 522 budget.\nSpeaker 2: Another major theme was about community ownership and agency. Residents and housing advocates emphasized the importance of supporting community land trusts and other shared equity models. And the plan includes programs to provide technical assistance to two groups to pursue those kinds of models.\nSpeaker 2: Another. Some other programs in the plan also are around trying to the first time homebuyer assistance is a focus of the plan as well as trying to create leadership and community capacity building so that people, and particularly in communities of color, can advocate for themselves on important priorities and issues that affect their community, including housing.\nSpeaker 2: Another theme that we heard a lot about was the need for housing for a special group. And the plan supports many of the ongoing programs and services provided by the Continuum of Care that provide services for people experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, and looking at expanding many hubs such as the Atlantic Farms, Shelter and Services\nSpeaker 2: that were located in North Long Beach and recently. Other strategies include. More senior housing across the city to provide avenues for older residents to downsize and remain in their neighborhoods. Finally, another theme is that the creating more opportunity for housing in what is called high opportunity or high resource areas, which is a designation made by the state\nSpeaker 2: . Some of the key programs and strategies for increasing access to housing and high opportunity areas are shown on this slide, and it does involve a multi-pronged approach to addressing the issue, which is an issue that is a result of many generations.\nSpeaker 2: Multi-generational issue that has created segregation in the city. Although there are few sites in the site inventory in the high opportunity areas, even with the UAE place type, the plan does call for supporting finding ways and through zoning, update and zoning and implementation of the QE to support a variety of housing types in low density zones.\nSpeaker 2: The EDB ordinance, the enhanced NC 20 bonus ordinance will also make mixed income housing viable in more parts of the city, including high resource areas and the accessory dwelling unit production of accessory dwelling units in all areas of the city, including low density residential areas, is another important strategy for creating housing new housing in high resource areas\nSpeaker 2: , as is the C plan, which was adopted recently and created capacity for a significant number of 2500 units of housing in high resource areas. Other. This slide also shows other programs that are intended to increase the amount of housing in those areas.\nSpeaker 2: So the next few slides are going to try to summarize the feedback, the process that the plan that the city has to go through to get this plan adopted and certified by the state. And some of this summarizes some of the feedback that was received that the revised plan addresses.\nSpeaker 2: So completed a first review of the housing element and provided comments in September, September 17th of 2021. And the city has updated the plan to reflect those comments. And it is expected that the city will staff will resubmit the updated draft for a second round of review with HPD, and they have 60 days to evaluate the plan\nSpeaker 2: . And if the plan is found to be substantially compliant, staff will then bring the plan back to the City Council for final adoption. If not, then there will have to be for the revisions made the plan the city does.\nSpeaker 2: The plan does need to be both adopted by the City Council and certified by the State, the Housing Department of the State by no later than February 11th of 2022. In order to avoid being forced to rezone to complete this rezoning program in one year instead of three and other penalties and ramifications for not having a certified\nSpeaker 2: plan. Okay. So this slide just quickly summarizes the HD feedback and city response. And as you can see, one of the most substantial pieces of feedback from the state related to the city's ability to compliance with affirmatively furthering fair housing and making sure that housing for all income levels and particularly low income levels, is feasible in the\nSpeaker 2: high resource areas of the city. So on the right is and some of the programs that I described in the previous slides are the ways in which the city has responded to that and try to ensure that there are opportunities for housing throughout.\nSpeaker 2: And that includes updates to the site inventory and strengthening a number of housing programs and actions and better articulating the things that the city has already done and all of the housing ordinances, for example, that the Council has adopted more recently, other feedback largely has been more technical in nature and requesting additional data and analysis to back\nSpeaker 2: up the site inventory. Making more firm the commitments of actions of the plan with specific time frames and other sort of data providing other data and technical cleanups and clarifications. This slide basically is just to emphasize what the laws are and and to what our obligations are under state law and related to assessing and promoting fair housing\nSpeaker 2: in Long Beach and the bottom half. This slide shows the specific feedback again that the city received in terms of compliance on that issue. This provides an overview of the findings of the Fair Housing Assessment, which can be found in Appendix F in the interest of time.\nSpeaker 2: I won't go into too much detail about this, but essentially the analysis does show that there are there is a need for creating more housing opportunities in high opportunity areas. And the the programs that I outlined previously are the city's response to trying to improve that and address that issue.\nSpeaker 2: This, again, just summarizes the the ways in which the city has responded. I think I've covered that already. And. These are just examples of ways in which the actions were clarified and more detail was provided in response to some of the feedback from the Housing Department.\nSpeaker 2: I won't go into detail about this. I explained a little bit about the site inventory. I'm happy to answer any questions that the Council might have on the site inventory. And so with that will conclude the presentation. These are the next the recommendation and next steps.\nSpeaker 2: We're again, we're looking to have the council just confirm the the plan and the policy direction of the plan. Then the staff will be submitting the plan to HD for a second round of review. Final adoption by City Council prior to certification by the state and then implementation is already under way and will continue to be underway\nSpeaker 2: . And with that, I conclude the presentation and staff is available to answer any questions. And we do have one of our consultants here if there are any questions that she can help answer. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Well, thank you, Steven Dauber, for that very, very detailed report. When you go back to the. The screen here. We have quite a bit of public comment on this particular item. There's no one writing this from the council.\nSpeaker 0: I'd like to hear from public comment first. Well, 23 speakers signed up. Claire, can you just remind us what our policy is in terms of public speaking?\nSpeaker 3: First in a three minute.\nSpeaker 1: If we know that we have over ten speakers, we normally cut it to 90 seconds.\nSpeaker 0: Each speaker will have 90 seconds. We'll start with and I'll allow the curtain call the names.\nSpeaker 1: Sure. So I'm going to call the first five speakers, if you could line up at the podium. Rosa, Homes, Magdalena. Per day. Maggie Valenzuela. And I can say, Joseph Lombardi, if those first five speakers can please come to the podium as a reminder, please keep your mask on at all times.\nSpeaker 1: Vocal said, okay, if I take my mask off. No, please, please keep your mask on. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Council members. My name is Rose and Holmes.\nSpeaker 3: And a.\nSpeaker 1: Part of the Long Beach Coalition.\nSpeaker 3: I'm a resident in Signal Hill right now, but lived in Long Beach District one for three years.\nSpeaker 1: I was told.\nSpeaker 3: I had to leave my last unit.\nSpeaker 1: Where.\nSpeaker 3: I was paying 1500.\nSpeaker 0: Dollars a month.\nSpeaker 3: Because the building was bought by the new owner and they were going to renovate and I could not stay. I moved to signal a signal. You know, we are now pay $3,000 a month rent. I was 76 years.\nSpeaker 1: Old.\nSpeaker 3: And barely making ends meet as a care worker. Most of our family and friends is not here anymore currently and they have two months and have to worry about possibly being evicted and moving again. To top it all off, I was denied rental assistance in Long Beach because I live in Signal Hill and was.\nSpeaker 1: Told.\nSpeaker 3: I needed to apply through Los Angeles County.\nSpeaker 1: So we're.\nSpeaker 3: Asking, please advise.\nSpeaker 1: Action.\nSpeaker 3: 5 to 2 to adopt a.\nSpeaker 1: Policy.\nSpeaker 3: On substantial remodels that early 2022. Instead of waiting until 2023.\nSpeaker 1: Films, your time is up.\nSpeaker 3: I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. 90 seconds has inspired you to comment.\nSpeaker 3: I can't hear you.\nSpeaker 0: The speaker.\nSpeaker 3: Please.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Your time is up, ma'am.\nSpeaker 3: Oh.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker. Men. I'm not Menominee either. We want listed on why we're putting this collar quality on the lobbyist. We want to know if you feel that your mental illness is part of the parallel. Apartamento nine.\nSpeaker 1: For me Edificio el Gobierno is another single problem. Upcoming Review of American Mental Health when you've been on the air. But our primary hook at the moment is Costa del Apartamento Formiga. So they own the astrophysical melting capacitor, but I bet they don't care what we mean.\nSpeaker 1: There is only problem with both of us that are they me in a square left elbow in your mouth with your of as well? Apartamento, but I can put it up. Let me go to my audience. I'm going to put it on but if we're to consider for a the to more for whom we got a leprosy\nSpeaker 1: like episode code is appropriate. I would mako someone Christopher below for our concern is a lecture on Singapore also but tell a political horror removal of your little Socialist Party principle. The main thing people in the world are solving, they're in distress.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. My name is Michaela PEREIRA, District nine.\nSpeaker 1: I live in District nine, part of the Long Beach Quality Coalition. I live.\nSpeaker 2: In a building where.\nSpeaker 1: I had previously heard a.\nSpeaker 2: Request to fix a unit due to a new.\nSpeaker 1: Extension in my building. The landlord did nothing. I have issues with my knee and I take medication for it. Landlord came one day and told me the next day I had to.\nSpeaker 2: Move all my staff from the unit so they could fumigate.\nSpeaker 1: They gave me one day notice I am physically incapable of doing my own move. We do my knee problems, my husband works late and my son has called. The landlord advised me if I did not move things around in the unit so they will fumigate.\nSpeaker 1: They will charge me an amount of 40 or $50, $50. The pressure I have gone through with the landlord has caused me a lot of stress. I ask this advice action 5.2.2 to adopt a policy on substantial remodels by early 2020 instead of waiting until 2020.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, council members. My name is Maggie Valenzuela. I'm the senior organizer for Lane and part of the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and Healthy Community. Housing was already a crisis for our community before the pandemic. I personally have spoken to renters like Shelly Ward, who couldn't be here today because she's been sick due to the\nSpeaker 1: stress her and her husband are facing because her landlord has recently given her a three day notice, even though she's applied for rental assistance and has paid 25% of her backed up rent to not be evicted. She is one of many members who have talked to us about landlords taking advantage of them because they can't speak the\nSpeaker 1: language, they don't know their legal rights or have fallen behind on rent because of the pandemic. I urge Council to direct staff to establish additional tenant protections in housing plan program 5.2, including revising action 5.2 to to adopt a policy on substantial remodels by early 2022 instead of 2023, and strengthening the local just cause for eviction ordinance\nSpeaker 1: . Families are being pushed to their financial limit because of enormous housing costs. Long Beach must do better for those who are barely hanging on during these tough economic times. Please incorporate these important policies and programs into the housing element.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Some I can feel. Sixth District resident Thank you staff for that report. I think it did a great effort in showing that, objectively speaking, the city has failed most of its citizens with regard to this housing problem. We simply do not have the supply of units for low income, lower income and even moderate income people.\nSpeaker 3: And we are pushing the youth and our seniors out of the city. As the staff report showed, African-Americans in the city of Long Beach, eight out of ten of us are renters. In the sixth District where I live, and 19% of the African-American population left.\nSpeaker 3: And the number one reason for leaving was because of rent. So this is a point of showing that policy is predicated on cleansing, ethnic cleansing with respect to solutions. I think one thing that we can look to, our brother city of Los Angeles is banning the concept of eyevine.\nSpeaker 3: That is a a concept in which organizations like Zillow and Redfin actively buy houses, and it prevents homeowner first time homeowners from buying houses and they're competing with private equity. Zillow has 365 homes in the city of Los Angeles, city of Long Beach, up for sale, and they're now selling them to private equity companies like Blackstone.\nSpeaker 3: And we're not allowed to compete with them. That's a problem. And we need to make a solution out of that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your comments.\nSpeaker 1: That speaker from Speaker Joseph Lombardi. And then following that is Katie DOMA, Melody Ozuna, Joseph Goldblatt and Tatiana Jensen.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. I'm here to support Joseph, who's right next to me, Michelle as well. And Sandra, these are folks who are living on City Center Motel and are here in District one to advocate for a strong housing element.\nSpeaker 3: I can't begin to tell the stories. I really wish the council member who represents the area could talk to them at this meeting. There's just a lot to be said for the units originally now down to nine units.\nSpeaker 3: They've received eviction notices. City Center wants to tear down to build again something more luxurious. The tenants here are here to advocate for a housing element that's tenant centered, right. That takes into consideration specifics, very specific objectives that could be met.\nSpeaker 3: We've looked at the document. It's very vague. If we can work on being more specific and more goal oriented in terms of timeline, I think that would bring a lot of hope to people who are having a difficult time finding affordable housing or any kind of housing at the moment.\nSpeaker 3: So Joseph's going to share a little bit as to what's happening.\nSpeaker 0: On Joseph Bloomberg Council. Basically, they're telling us to move out of the place without a word or nothing just to come out of nowhere. All these investors came to our property that were and they were surprised we were there, that we were evicted out of there.\nSpeaker 0: I don't even know that we were there. All these big investors were.\nSpeaker 3: All going to. And so we've been.\nSpeaker 0: Fighting them for years to get more time. And we're not. Oh, well.\nSpeaker 3: I get a few when I talk about you.\nSpeaker 0: And I haven't had one speaker signed up with that. Joseph Lombardi.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So unfortunately, we can't allow the entire group to speak, but we thank you for your comments and invite up the next speaker.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Katie Duma. Melodie Ozuna, Joseph Goldblatt, Tatyana Jensen and Liz Vanderwerff. Good evening. My name is Kate, the owner. I think I still live in District two if the lines haven't moved yet. Um, you've seen and read the report.\nSpeaker 1: You know the statistics. But we are not statistics. We are residents, people voting residents in all of your districts. And we need affordable housing now. We can't wait for 200 for 2023 to eliminate the model exemption. That should be a priority to preserve existing affordable housing.\nSpeaker 3: As soon as.\nSpeaker 1: Possible. And I think you have time. Before the current county moratorium expires to revisit protecting all tenants at current risk. Because there is no legal reason preventing you from doing so and making it retroactive. I know you have already decided not to, but there's.\nSpeaker 3: No legal justification.\nSpeaker 1: For that. On another issue as.\nSpeaker 3: Recommended in your.\nSpeaker 1: Presentation, I hope you will follow it. Even if you don't add additional affordable housing plots to the east side. If you lift the zoning restrictions for multiple family dwellings in those areas and in all areas of the city, at least then private property owners will have the ability to replace single family dwellings or whatever other units on\nSpeaker 1: their properties with multi-family units. So if.\nSpeaker 3: Somebody wants to knock down.\nSpeaker 1: Their mansion and build a 20 unit apartment building.\nSpeaker 3: They could do so even if you're not going to. So please lift all.\nSpeaker 1: The zoning restrictions that prevent.\nSpeaker 3: Multi-Family dwellings in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. My name is Melody Ozuna. I'm an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. We provide free legal services to low income people throughout L.A. County. We have a community office here in Long Beach where one of our main priorities is housing.\nSpeaker 1: I'm also a resident of the eighth District. I'm here today to ask for two changes to the housing element the city. First, the city needs to identify more affordable housing sites on the east side of Long Beach. And second, the housing needs stronger.\nSpeaker 1: The housing element needs stronger anti displacement policies and programs. We are asking for the addition of a rent stabilization order to eliminate substantial remodel as a cause of reason for eviction now and for the city to set up a rental housing division.\nSpeaker 1: Regarding my first task, the city needs as cites the east side of Long Beach. While the housing element acknowledges the impact of segregation, redlining and that those problems have increased since the 1990s. The city's plan for affordable housing is almost solely focused on the west, central and downtown areas of the city.\nSpeaker 1: Well, almost completely ignoring the east side of Long Beach, which identifies as high opportunity areas. The additional 25 sites are not enough by placing site inventories, mostly on the west, central and downtown areas. The city argues to estimate that mercury housing into those areas will increase opportunities and resources to the areas that does not address segregation, nor\nSpeaker 1: does it affirmatively further fair housing. Thank you. We submitted a letter today for your review. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Speaker Priest.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. My name is Tatiana Jensen, and I'm here. I'm a pile driver and a member of the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. I live in the local area and grew up local to Long Beach. I work and create in the vicinity of the project.\nSpeaker 1: I believe that I could be impacted and me and my brothers and sisters would be impacted by the environmental impacts of the project. The city should require the project to be built utilizing a local and skilled and trained workforce so we can be, with our families, help out in our community, and stay local to the place that\nSpeaker 1: we love. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name is Joseph Goldblatt. I am a member of the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. I live and work in the vicinity of the project as well, and I believe that it will impact by the environmental impacts of the project.\nSpeaker 3: The city should require the project to be built utilizing a local and skilled and trained workforce. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: If you don't.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. My name is Liz Vanderwerff. I'm a finished worker and a member of the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. I do live local in Long Beach. I don't often get to work here. Actually, I've never gotten to work here, but I spend all the rest of my time here and I believe that I will be impacted by\nSpeaker 1: the environmental impacts of the project. The city should require the product to be built utilizing a local, unskilled and trained workforce. It would be amazing to be able to work and create in the city that I spend all the rest of my time in.\nSpeaker 1: So thank you. Next speakers are. Francisco McCullough. Rafael Pimentel. Ray Lawson. Jorge Quintero. Jenna Lim. Those speakers can please come forward. Francisco.\nSpeaker 0: I just want to make be clear that we're talking about the housing element, correct? Okay. I'm not not aware of specific project. My name is Rafael Patel and I'm with the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. And wouldn't that be a great thing.\nSpeaker 3: That all these housing projects that we're discussing tonight, that they would be built by a skilled and trained workforce, local residents here, that only.\nSpeaker 0: That are going to be able to build these projects, but they'll be the ones to build the projects that are going to live in these housing.\nSpeaker 3: Developments. Would that be awesome to have that? So we're asking the city council today that in considering any further projects that will be built under this plan, that you would.\nSpeaker 0: Please consider building it and.\nSpeaker 3: Implementing it into your policy to employ a skilled and trained and local workforce here in the.\nSpeaker 0: City of Long Beach. Thanks for your time.\nSpeaker 3: You. Good evening, city council members. Once again, my name is very Lawson. Good to see you. Good to be back from our recovery. We have over 50,000 members in six states, and we have several hundred of our members that live and work right here in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: As you can see, our brothers and sisters showed up tonight to speak on the general plan. We believe live here, work here in Long Beach. If the plan goes forward with the zoning element in the housing element, we want it to go on record that we want a skilled and trained workforce skills and training work for the\nSpeaker 3: people that live here. And working in Long Beach can be with their families. They can coach soccer, football, the doctors that are in cheerleading. And it's also the environmental impact of having them work here. There's less gas, there's less transportation.\nSpeaker 3: It helps when it comes to environmental impact. So we would just like to consider that when they do the the general plan, the zoning part of it, they can that language be added to the general plan forthcoming? That's what we're here for and that's what we're asking for.\nSpeaker 3: So thank you for your time, city council.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your comments.\nSpeaker 3: Let's take a move. Good afternoon, city council. My name is Water Control. I'm also with the Carpenters Union Local 562 here in Long Beach. And my partner here took a lot of my talking points, so I won't repeat all of them.\nSpeaker 3: But again, local hire. A lot of these members you know outside of a part of the. Of a letter that I have here looking at just closed possession general areas can have significant impact in about your environmental benefits.\nSpeaker 3: The California Planning Roundtable noted back in 2018, people who live and work in the same jurisdiction will be most likely to transit, walk or bicycle to work so than the residents and business communities and their vehicle trips will be shorter.\nSpeaker 3: So again, we just ask that you consider implementing skilled work, trade or skill and training workforce and. Take us some, I think, very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Janice O'Quinn of Rub Alaska, Aurelia Ortega, Elsa tung, Daniel Lim, Marlena Sanchez, please line up. Good evening. My name is Jenna. I am a resident of District six and I go to Wilson High School. Growing up, it was a lot of instability, constantly moving houses and jobs and schools and new friends.\nSpeaker 1: When I moved to Long Beach in the middle of eighth grade, it was because our last house overcrowded and my dad had found a job here. During my freshman year, the pandemic hit. My dad was laid off and I had to apply for unemployment as a result.\nSpeaker 1: My house also like was always on the brink of exploding. My parents were arguing over paying bills and rent and that we were in afraid. If we could, we would have to move out. And I will have to finish.\nSpeaker 1: I won't be able to finish high school here in Long Beach. The stress and wearing on top of school made it hard for me to focus. I lost interest and interest in things I used to love. My dad was getting offers for jobs, but the offers never offered enough to pay rent.\nSpeaker 1: This pushed my dad to look for jobs elsewhere. And he now works and lives in Texas to provide for my family here in Long Beach. Our family shouldn't be separated because rent is too high. I shouldn't have to fail or fall behind the school either.\nSpeaker 1: But this is a real price we pay when housing is not affordable. I know my son is not the only one who pays a high, high price to survive in Long Beach. Six out of out of every ten black x renters are rent burdened, and they pay more than 30% of their income on rent.\nSpeaker 1: For me and many people here tonight, being part of a local organization is a lifeline to getting a resources that help us to survive and thrive. My my hope is that one of the city will know where to go when they when they are in a crisis about where to live.\nSpeaker 1: Knowing our rights as renters can also protect during these challenging times. Thank you for your time, you. Thank you. That's when I started. All the numbers are what I don't figure you'll be born in the street or say good evening.\nSpeaker 3: My name is How did get and I live in District six.\nSpeaker 1: And they're calling on November zero to receive you. So me and brother group law launch.\nSpeaker 3: So I live in zip code 90 813 and I belong to the group and.\nSpeaker 1: Estonia keeper of the year 11. I don't know or belong to the civilization, the la Renta commune. Police are in a plan.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm here to ask you to promote in order to stabilize rent as part of the plan.\nSpeaker 1: That we we end up a needed. But we needed all this. The sorrow had been so imperative of the BBN that.\nSpeaker 3: In order to prevent evictions and the loss of homes.\nSpeaker 1: From being destroyed, property so established the proposition, the inclusion of these two narratives and programs they planned to be behind the scenes close to you.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm also here asking you to do more. Protections for tenants can be applied for the 5.2 part of the plan.\nSpeaker 1: No matter what we see on the allocations in community laws. But I will start on the ordinance to remove the rational system pillars. But.\nSpeaker 3: And also to take care of the point have to in order to prevent the remodeling part of the order.\nSpeaker 1: Who said there was a little mill based? It imposes on me very distressed.\nSpeaker 3: For them to take place in Tucson in 2022 instead of 2023.\nSpeaker 1: Numeral laws for Palisade Road. In answer, the ABC honors the the gosa holster.\nSpeaker 3: And then also to strengthen the a cost to the the fair eviction cost or order.\nSpeaker 1: Based on which other the grasses and.\nSpeaker 3: That is all thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: When I survey several Belasco.\nSpeaker 3: Without knowing my or even my name is out of Alaska.\nSpeaker 1: Maybe only three to say I.\nSpeaker 3: Am from Detroit six.\nSpeaker 1: And recording a bottle in the window to preface.\nSpeaker 3: My coat. My zip code is 90 813 Siamese Resistance.\nSpeaker 1: The other is the lounge.\nSpeaker 3: And I am also part of the members of the resistance of lounge.\nSpeaker 1: And style. Keep up by the 11 hour bonanza this public session.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm here to ask you to elevate and order an ordinance for stabilization.\nSpeaker 1: The renter. Come on up, Alicia and Planetary. We end up. We need a little friend of mine.\nSpeaker 3: For that to be part of the plan in order to prevent evictions. Yeah. I mean.\nSpeaker 1: EPA there are between the solar hope and the Permian historically, but a barrier is established. Protection there in cleanliness.\nSpeaker 3: And also, I'm asking you here for the eviction protection to be established. And part of the plan is program.\nSpeaker 1: And they will be in the single year.\nSpeaker 3: And that would be part of the plan. 5.2.\nSpeaker 1: That includes a provisional election, single of one. But are that there or no ordinance?\nSpeaker 3: And then to have an action in order to review 5.2 true in order to adopt an ordinance.\nSpeaker 1: The Roman election so centavo but I mean when you go.\nSpeaker 3: To a for the substantive or substantial remodeling for the year 22 to remove the instead of 23.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It at a number of those watermen sailors the answer the it was going to the council.\nSpeaker 3: And also to make a stronger ordinance regarding provisions.\nSpeaker 1: Which are aggressive.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Excuse me.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, city council. My name is Elsa Tongue Language Forward and a District seven resident. First, I want to thank so much staff for your tremendous work on this extremely complex document. At least seven, at least 11. CBOs have been engaging low income renters of color.\nSpeaker 1: The majority of this city on this extremely complex housing element and some that we urge city council to direct the staff to implement four specific improvements. Number one, as you've already heard, elevate a rent stabilization ordinance as a specific policy or program in the Chapter six housing plan with specific actions, objectives and timeframes.\nSpeaker 1: Number two, establish additional tenant protections in housing plan program 5.2, including 5.2.2 on substantial remodels for 2022. Number three, I'll spend more time on this identifying more housing sites, especially affordable housing sites in high resource areas, especially East Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: Look, we need to dismantle the legacies of redlining and segregation from more than 80 years ago. 67% of all of the identified housing sites in the inventory are located in high segregation, slash poverty, low resource or moderate resource areas.\nSpeaker 1: In fact, more housing sites have been identified in the highest poverty neighborhoods than the highest resourced neighborhoods. Housing. Justice now.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Daniel Loo and I'm giving public comment on behalf of Cambodia countries and United Cambodian community. Thank you for having a portion of the agenda on Native American Heritage Month. However, there is more we can do to ground equity in the EU plan.\nSpeaker 3: Land is housing and home to our native community, so we need to move beyond land acknowledgment towards land reclamation and reconciliation. Housing is not just a resource, it's a living manifestation that affects everyone's overall life. Because of high rent increases and covert COVID exacerbation of existing inequities, our combined community and broader black indigenous and policy community is\nSpeaker 3: dealing with overcrowding, with multiple generations living in one home, making it difficult environment to learn and concentrate, especially during COVID virtual classrooms. I teach ethnic studies to high school students at UAB and I witnessed what they go through.\nSpeaker 3: Being in the kitchen or parking lot or wherever, you know, it just breaks my heart that this is the reality that we live. On top of that, COVID spread quick. When one of our family members get sick. When the dad.\nSpeaker 3: If the dad were to get sick, everyone gets sick. So there's no space to quarantine. This is our reality. We don't only need equitable housing protections now, but we also need homeownership pathways. Because only 25% of my folks own housing similar to our black community.\nSpeaker 3: We need more home ownership in the broader black, indigenous and poor communities. Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Next speaker is Marlena Sanchez and then Elizabeth Linder and Jordan. When. Hi. My name's Alexis. As an additional six. For the past seven years, I've been leading my community with my girls in action and my 20 years of being alive.\nSpeaker 1: I'm a 13 times. Sometimes you meet every other year. Every few months. It looks like you're always running from increasing rent payments and choosing to rent the way things are going. We can afford vacation or take a simple break to take care of our personal health and well-being.\nSpeaker 1: Growing up with your parents could be homework if they were comfortable working at least 2 to 3 jobs at a time. My sisters and I had to grow up faster and taking adult responsibilities just so that our family could continue to live in a city that an immigrant refugee families call home.\nSpeaker 1: Living in the city that I worked so hard to improve comes with a lot of sacrifices. Instead of spending less time with our loved ones, the time we do spend at home are always stressed. I was. It was so hard for me to focus on homework and school every other, fall behind the class and take a break\nSpeaker 1: from or instead of taking a break during the summer, I was trying to make my Grade Saybrook graduate and was 17. I saw my after school hours after working as a certified nursing assistant to help pay for rent.\nSpeaker 1: Like many working families, the pandemic took a toll on my whole family. We lost our jobs and could not work again. We had to scramble to survive and find a source of income like me and my little sister to focus on school so leaders like myself deserve to have a home in this city.\nSpeaker 1: We worked so hard to improve. We deserve to experience all the great things. But for me to meet leaders like you to make sure that we have affordable housing without getting displaced. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Hi. Elizabeth cannot be here.\nSpeaker 1: She's feeling sick, so I'm taking her spot. Good evening, everyone. My name is Gary Hernandez. I'm the executive director for the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition. And I'm here today because the housing element plan will solve all of the issues impacting our communities right now.\nSpeaker 2: But because you need to hear and make changes to this plan in order to begin to.\nSpeaker 1: Address what is pressing for poor renters of color here in Long Beach. That will be see. We listen to countless stories from immigrant families, the work that we work with, about struggles, about the struggles they face due to an affordable housing.\nSpeaker 1: The Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: People that have lived here for more than 20 years.\nSpeaker 1: Are dealing with landlords that are increasing rents despite a global pandemic. And they're also harassing and intimidating these families.\nSpeaker 2: Tenants have very limited.\nSpeaker 1: Resources to turn to and are ultimately being pushed out of Long Beach because they can no longer afford to live here, a city that they helped build. This is not a surprise that the city's own maps show that the legacy of racial redlining and housing segregation still exists in the city, with white folks concentrated in the East\nSpeaker 1: Long Beach area and poor people of color concentrated in central West and North Beach. This housing element is not for for fair housing and in fact reinforces historical redlining, segregation and racial concentrations of poverty. Long Beach. In order to keep our communities here and prevent more mass displacement, Long Beach renters need a local control rent stabilization ordinance\nSpeaker 1: that goes above and beyond state law. It is doable. Thank you so much. And other neighbors, other neighboring cities have done it. Santa Ana has done it. We can do it here, too.\nSpeaker 3: Hello. My name is Jordan Winn. I am a member of the Second District. You've heard so many amazing quotes tonight from folks around my community who just want to continue living in the city that they love from a community that has raised so many amazing, intersecting communities.\nSpeaker 3: We want to make sure that people have a safe place to live. When I think about the housing unit, the housing element today, I think about the vacant units that exist throughout the city that are deemed unaffordable just because of the priority of the priorities of the city has set so far.\nSpeaker 3: And the fact that we have not been building or putting into the priorities of the minds of the people in this city, the affordable housing that we need to have on the ground. I think about how in the current housing element, many of the places that are zoned or want to be zoned for affordable or re adapted\nSpeaker 3: to be affordable are in north, central and west Long Beach. And then I think about the vacant Kmart on the east side that is so much empty space for affordable units. I think about so many of these new places that we should be thinking about on the east side to adapt housing and the fact that we need\nSpeaker 3: to think outside of the boxes of old and segregated housing policies and expand our minds. There. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: They don't do a proper comment on the whole thing. No.\nSpeaker 3: I think somebody has the open mic on the phone apology.\nSpeaker 0: We'll give you a few extra.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. Sorry, ma'am. I doing something wrong. The basic point is we have over 2000 people experiencing homelessness in the city right now. We have over 60,000 people paying 90% or more of their income to rent. And that has only been exacerbated because of the pandemic.\nSpeaker 3: We sit at a very critical point. The policy that we make tonight informs the next eight, ten years, of course, in our immediate span, but also decades into the future of how housing is going to be developed in our community.\nSpeaker 3: We need to make sure that we are prioritizing renters, low income renters and communities of color so that we preserve the culture and the beauty of Long Beach for years to come. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 1: That concludes public comment for this item.\nSpeaker 0: Great. So I'll take it back to under the rail. We have the most moving of the motion of Councilmember Sorrell, seconded by Councilwoman Allen. I'll turn it over to Councilman Massaro.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Austin. And thank you to.\nSpeaker 2: All those who who provided.\nSpeaker 1: Their public comment and had helped do outreach and assistance on our housing element plan. So thank you to staff for all your hard work on the Element Plan, especially doing the public education and outreach in the midst of the pandemic.\nSpeaker 1: So I just appreciate all that's been done in response to the pandemic as well. When we had housing concerns around rental assistance, providing the legal counsel for tenants to conversion of motels to temporary housing, as well as providing permanent supportive housing, as well as also just all the recent work around the ordinance that was adopted that, you\nSpeaker 1: know, goes back to these providing these pilot program to allow the 5500 medical units in downtown inclusionary housing policy, enhanced density bonus ordinance. As was mentioned earlier, I just wanted to just kind of go back to how much work has been done in the midst of the pandemic, and then also what we're continuing to do to make\nSpeaker 1: sure we're addressing this housing crisis as well as our effort to do rezoning. And I'm looking forward to the ACES, that process that we'll be doing in the midtown area. And so have also been proud to have have done a grand opening of a 95 unit, affordable housing at Spark at Midtown, as well as doing a more\nSpeaker 1: recent groundbreaking of bridge housing for 88 units. And there's plan for another groundbreaking for affordable housing in central Long Beach early next year. And I share this because there is a higher number of affordable housing sites that are have been identified and and more identified.\nSpeaker 1: But I'm really interested in looking at the inventory of how many housing sites are identified. I do get a sense that 67% or have been located kind of in the general west central north area. But could you share the inventory, a breakdown based on region?\nSpeaker 1: Because I can see from the mapping that there are certainly more in certain parts of our city than others.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, council members. Thank you for your question. So just some information to share about the site inventory and how housing the site inventory is. The sites are distributed among different areas. It's notable that the the site inventory locates 9% of lower income units in the more concentrated areas of poverty, compared to 23% moderate income units and\nSpeaker 2: 13% above moderate. So the point that I'm trying to make here is that with the distribution of the housing units on the site inventory, there's actually a greater portion of those units in the moderate income and market rate and that levels of affordability that are in those concentrated areas of poverty.\nSpeaker 2: So the site inventory sites actually do begin to change the that distribution.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for that information. But it's still concerning to me the higher debt amount of density will.\nSpeaker 2: Be increasing over.\nSpeaker 1: The span of the element of this plan. And I'm really concerned because we've.\nSpeaker 2: Already been having increasing issue with.\nSpeaker 1: Parking, increasing issue with just ensuring there's open available space. So what I would want to understand is how do we how can we go back to the fair housing process, right? How do we I know that the loo has been a and an element of challenge, but I want to know how can we continue to work at\nSpeaker 1: this so that there are housing sites identified evenly spaced out because there's so much density we can put over the next eight, ten years in the region that has already high density.\nSpeaker 2: Right. So just to provide a little bit more information on the of the units in the site inventory, 5% are in the highest resource area and nearly 10% are in the high resource area. 35, almost more than 35% are in the moderate resource areas.\nSpeaker 2: And that leaves the remaining what percentages that about 40, 40% in the in the lower resource area in total. So I think to answer your question further, there are a number of programs in the in the plan that are aimed at addressing the issue.\nSpeaker 2: For example, program 6.9 has a requirement to monitor housing production in particular. The program specifies that monitoring housing at about the mid term of the cycle, as the staff in the city would monitor housing production to determine if the geographic distribution of units is furthering of the goal of distributed distributing across the different geographies of the city\nSpeaker 2: , especially the lower income units. And if it's not, there's a trigger in the plan to look at additional strategies to employ. And that could could involve, you know, looking at the the land use element again and identifying additional areas in the city that could be could accommodate multi-family housing.\nSpeaker 2: I know. My time's up, so I'll call you again.\nSpeaker 1: But I just wanted to clarify to make sure I got my math correct.\nSpeaker 2: So you said 5%.\nSpeaker 1: In the higher resource area, 35% moderate, 40% lower, and then I'm missing 20%.\nSpeaker 2: Where is that one go? There are there's about 15% among the two. There's sort of six gradations on that math indicate is that six or seven. So among the highest and high resource areas, there's 15% total. In the moderate resource areas, there's a little more than 35%.\nSpeaker 2: So the remainder is in the low resource or high segregation and poverty area.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I'll call you up again.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker. Councilmember Owen.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Thank you so much for that. I want to say thank you as well by recognizing Patricia and Allison four and everyone of development services for all the hard work that they've done on this item and all they've done with regards to housing assistance.\nSpeaker 1: I also want to thank all the housing advocate and organizations, even the Southwest Regional Carpenters came out tonight. So I appreciate seeing you guys here. And and I do agree, when we don't have a project right now, we're talking about when one does come up, I stand with you.\nSpeaker 1: We need skilled and trained people. But but one of the things that I want to say to all these advocates, that housing has been a crisis even before the pandemic. So I agree with all of your signed hold em up housing justice now.\nSpeaker 1: I said many times that housing is one of my top priorities and I will continue to speak in favor of policies and ideas that create a more equitable housing climate here in Long Beach. On page 21, you had a comment from someone on your presentation.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if you just want to pull that out, but I can tell you every resident feels the same way. I mean, they are really concerned about where they're going to live. And we need to strengthen our affordable housing opportunities in the city, and we have to make sure that we protect our vulnerable populations.\nSpeaker 1: I mean, everyone, everyone, everyone in this city should be able to afford to live in this city. I think that staff has done a great job on this item. The revised housing element incorporates changes from the community feedback and feedback from the state authorities.\nSpeaker 1: I do also really appreciate the efforts to identify more housing opportunities. But I continue to believe we need to do more to increase the number of housing sites, even on the east side. Also appreciated the inclusion of more dad points and the efforts to strengthen our existing programs.\nSpeaker 1: The revised A housing element improves our housing climate, and I will absolutely be supporting this. The current housing draft element says to adopt a code amendment substantial remodel by 2023. I know one of the first things I did when I got elected and started working on this substantial remodel ordinance, and I appreciate my colleagues that have signed\nSpeaker 1: on to this, and I think it's important that this happen sooner than later. And I specifically like you to address can we move this up to 2022 instead of 2023?\nSpeaker 3: Okay. The council member would be glad to take any direction that the full council wants to provide. I do want to just clarify some of the dates and reasonings behind the date. So that item is scheduled for consideration by this council in a couple of weeks on December six.\nSpeaker 3: I try to always be optimistic. I think we have a good presentation for the Council and hope that you'll find consensus right there on the first try. At the same time, that doesn't always occur. I know on the short term rentals ordinance we came and thought we had direction and then came three more times for different first\nSpeaker 3: readings and it took about a year to get a final ordinance in that case. So anything we put in the housing element and we put a date there, we have to meet that date or we're subject to a litigation exposure from the state.\nSpeaker 3: So that's why the more outward date is in the document. If we want to put a certain a date, we can put a certain date. But I just need to disclose to the council that if we don't if we don't meet that day, we'll be the subject of being almost immediately out of compliance, which is not where\nSpeaker 3: we want to be.\nSpeaker 1: If I understand and you know, my major concern is that with that 2023 timeline, it may create space for folks to be evicted under the existing Jessica's Law. So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Price.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Austin. So thank you staff.\nSpeaker 2: For the presentation. I really.\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it. The way this process now we're we're going to present our recommendations to the state and engage in additional discussions. The second review, how on time how urgent is it that it be done within a certain period of time?\nSpeaker 1: Are we under any sort of time crunch right now?\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman. Yes, we're very much under a time crunch, given that February 11th, 2020 to date, by which we both have to achieve adoption by the city council and certification by the state, that we have to submit the plan to them immediately.\nSpeaker 2: Essentially, it was released to the public. The fact this second draft was released Friday, November 5th. Um, two weeks from that time is when we need to submit it to the state. The state does like the public to have had a couple of weeks to review the draft before the city submits it, but that is the timeline\nSpeaker 2: that we have to basically submit it right away. They have 60 days by state law to provide their next kind of round of feedback, and that already takes us into December, January, you know, mid-January potentially. So that's where our time crunch comes in.\nSpeaker 1: And we will have as a council another opportunity, of course, before final adoption will be able to take public input.\nSpeaker 0: All of that.\nSpeaker 3: You you you do. But there's a reason we're here tonight. You know, I think we did something similar with the land use element. If there are red flags or major changes that any member of the council wants to see, we need to know that now we can't be making those changes, you know, on the on the final\nSpeaker 3: day. When we come back for the final adoption, we can always do, you know, tweaks or language changes or whatever the pleasure of the council is. But tonight's proceedings are important because if we need to do a major change, which we don't think is warranted and we think we're in the right direction, but we're here for your\nSpeaker 3: confirmation and we would need direction tonight if there was more substantial change that any member wanted to see.\nSpeaker 1: I understand. I do want to thank staff your I thought your presentation was very thorough and I do appreciate the fact that you included what our arena goals are or the expectations are the reality that we're probably not going to meet those expectations.\nSpeaker 1: My understanding is that many cities are not going to meet that expectation and some aren't even working towards trying to meet that expectation. But that's neither here nor there. Language is working towards that. And and I appreciate that you included in there that as part of the east southeast area specific plan, we've added 2500 additional housing opportunities\nSpeaker 1: , which it's been decades since we've identified additional housing, especially at that level. And I'll just speak for the third district. I'm not going to speak for the whole East Side, but that's said to have 20% of our arena requirement the in one district.\nSpeaker 1: I want to say that I'm super proud of that because we worked really hard as part of the C CEP working with residents to try to get the buy in and the support for that. That's going to bring a lot of density to that PCH corridor.\nSpeaker 1: But I think the residents in the district have been along with the journey on the need for additional housing and are supportive of that. I do have a question we've talked a lot about I've heard a lot of public comment about we should put more affordable housing in this area versus that area.\nSpeaker 1: My question to you is, how are those decisions made? Are those arbitrary decisions that are made by staff regarding what districts they want to encumber with additional housing type of housing? Or are there some formulas or best practices that are used?\nSpeaker 3: So the as you know, the city does not build individual housing projects. We provide the underlying rules of the road, the zoning code, and we have very limited federal funds and some other funds that come out of the prior redevelopment area that we award into affordable housing development.\nSpeaker 3: It's really not driven by the city, it's driven by the state through a committee called Tick-Tock. And what TAC does is they award the low income housing tax credit and the low income housing tax credit. There may be 12 different funding sources in an affordable project, but that is the largest funding source and it has specific criteria\nSpeaker 3: . It needs to be close to a backstop. It needs to be close to a grocery store with all of these different criteria. And those criteria have changed and evolved over time. So while there was a prior focus very much on transit and we do have transit in the city, but it's not necessarily in a so called high\nSpeaker 3: opportunity area. The focus from the state. Awarding those tax credits was previously really focused on transit accessibility. Now there's a little bit less emphasis on that, and there is some new emphasis on other factors, including, you know, those higher opportunity areas.\nSpeaker 3: But that's a change that's happening now that you won't see on the ground for several years, because from the time that someone has an idea, I'm going to build an affordable housing project to the time they see shovels in the ground.\nSpeaker 3: It's about a five year period of time. So these changes in policy are very impactful. But you see that impact, you know, time wise much further into the future. And then the other thing is cost. So land cost is a factor.\nSpeaker 3: And where land costs are too high, you're typically not able to do affordable simply because the money behind affordable is competitive. So if your cost per unit is higher than a competing project, the competing project with a lower cost per unit in terms of development cost is going to prevail in terms of being able to secure competitive\nSpeaker 3: financing.\nSpeaker 1: And come and I have an additional question. I will note his answer took a long time, but it was very good. So I'm going to queue back up because I do have an additional question.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I want to thank all the speakers for coming out tonight. I know that affordable housing and housing as a whole is something that we all talk about a lot. I do want to kind of talk through a couple of comments that were made by the public tonight and some potential thoughts or solutions.\nSpeaker 1: When we talk about any particular property, some of these properties are owned by individuals who. Aren't interested in owning housing and or it's in a family trust that has. Significant, significant conflict within the family of how to move an asset and things like that.\nSpeaker 1: So know that as a council we're often approached by individuals who say. Stacy, you need to help this property become housing. I don't own the property. I can talk with the owners. I can encourage. We can reach out to.\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes they won't call us back. Sometimes they're not interested. Sometimes that's not what their family plan or portfolio is. And so there's a lot of opportunity in our city that won't be realized potentially because of the people who own them and their perception of the highest and best use of that property.\nSpeaker 1: So that's where incentives come in. Right. So we as a council work with the state and other organizations to figure out what are the incentives that we can put in place to encourage people to potentially change their investment model or to potentially consider selling or any of those other options.\nSpeaker 1: And when I sit down with individuals who are looking at I'm 80 youth, 80 years are really the main driver of additional housing on my side of town right now. And those ideas have come with considerable conflict from neighbors.\nSpeaker 1: There's a neighbor who believes in it and a neighbor who wants to put it in, and they invest the 20 to $25000 in permit fees and then they get a contractor who bids the project at. I was just talking to a neighbor $100,000 to put in a adu and that investment of $125,000 is met with to two\nSpeaker 1: different things. One, neighbors that live adjacent to them that are very angry. And so we need to do a better job, not only as a council, but as a community working with you to really share the bright side of those types of developments, to really change the tone and the discussion both online and in our neighborhoods and\nSpeaker 1: our community meetings so that there isn't a stigma attached to that. And then furthermore, these projects I have people I know who have been trying to get an 80 you and are still in the process and won't be completed for 2 to 3 years.\nSpeaker 1: And a lot of that holdup is amazing. People like yourselves that are in labor. There's so much demand right now that contractors are pushing back and saying, we can't start your project till May of 2022. And these are individuals who have been in the permit process for six months at the city side.\nSpeaker 1: And so what we need to come together on is what we can do to create more hours of work if you're interested, or how that works, because there's only so many people that are qualified labor and whether it's.\nSpeaker 1: The carpenters or plumbers or a steel worker. I mean, every single different trade. There has to be a way where we can work better together to provide those hours to the people in the community. Because the other side of it, too, is there's not really an incentive right now for your private general contractor to use anyone but\nSpeaker 1: the same 25 people they always use. And we need to find that incentive because if a project is held up at framing, all these other workers aren't getting that work and you're not getting that work because they've always used this one framer who has six other jobs.\nSpeaker 1: And so then both the housing isn't built and you're not getting those hours of availability. And so one of the things that that I would love to do is work with in our Economic Development Committee, we have some tools that we've used for our labor partners in the medical field that we think maybe might be a solution\nSpeaker 1: . So all agenda, all of that and find out if we can work together better. And Ray, I know I can reach out to you. I have your number and we can kind of talk through what those solutions could be.\nSpeaker 1: But you're a big part of that solution. Even if we want the housing, people are taking two years to get the housing that they can afford, much less the incentive side to make it so it's less than $125,000 for a studio.\nSpeaker 1: And then how do you make that affordable if it's on a property that already has significant tax base and other costs associated for someone to cover their cost? It's going to be 1700 a month. For a studio and 1700 a month is not market.\nSpeaker 1: Already. So how do we how do we find that middle ground? So. Those are the rest of my comments. But thank you all for being here. We want to be a part of that solution, but the market really has to be a part of it.\nSpeaker 1: Until we figure out the incentives that balance that market demand. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We'll go back to Councilmember Sara.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Austin. So I do want to circle back to the conversation or at least the questions I've been asking. I do agree, though, that we do need local labor to build locally on that part. I want to make sure make that statement before I forget.\nSpeaker 1: As so I wanted to clarify. When we talk about housing available site, we're not just talking about I want to make sure we get clarity. It's not just affordable housing, it's just housing stock, right?\nSpeaker 3: That's correct. So we're talking about different levels of housing, whether it's very low, low, moderate or above moderate. And 50% of the units are above moderate or what you would call market rate. And there's housing sites throughout the entire city.\nSpeaker 3: I know there's been a lot of discussion about how they're distributed, but they are distributed around the entire city, including opportunities to have moderate and higher income housing and some areas that maybe haven't seen that investment, as well as the opportunity to have some of that more affordable housing and in those more expensive areas.\nSpeaker 3: So it's it's not perfectly balanced because we don't start from scratch. The city is not a blank slate, right? So we started from existing conditions and the existing constraints and the land use element. But this plan does, you know, further our fair housing goals more than, you know, any other prior endeavor by the city.\nSpeaker 3: And we think, you know, it's satisfies the requirements of the law. But to answer your question from earlier, you know, sort of that work is is never fully done. So while now is not the moment to, you know, revisit past decisions or we think make wholesale changes to this plan, that's not to say the council doesn't continue\nSpeaker 3: having an ongoing role based on annual reports, based on after the land use element has existed for five years. That'll be an important step and it's built into that plan to revisit some of those assumptions. And that and stops here would be the more appropriate time to advance, you know, some of this discussion about reconsidering some of\nSpeaker 3: those sites in a particular part of town.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and I appreciate that. The opportunity to monitor annually just the production and that's kind of why I want to make sure that we get it right since it's an 8 to 10 year plan and that we want to make sure we give you all the feedback that we do.\nSpeaker 1: And in general, I just think that we need more housing production overall, obviously more so with affordable, but that's where I'm concerned is about the percentage around. We're not just saying that we need more affordable housing, evenly distributed throughout the city, we need all kinds of housing.\nSpeaker 1: And so that's why I'm concerned that that we're having less identified site in areas that are less dense. Right. I feel that we're carrying a lot of I feel like I speak for my district, that I'm carrying a lot of the burden of the housing production.\nSpeaker 1: And so I just want to make sure that we can look at opportunities to explore other kinds of housing that can help balance out the demand. Right. That's contributing to rising rent increase. And so that's where I want to make sure we we look at an opportunity to make sure we're not stuck with this plan that we\nSpeaker 1: couldn't annually revisit. Right. The production rate.\nSpeaker 3: So this is not an end point. And this council, you know, always has the discretion through the city manager to give a different direction about what they want studied and changes in policy, including zoning and land use. We do think that this plan, which is built on the land use element decisions made it and in 2019 is\nSpeaker 3: the right set of policies and programs for this moment. But we're also and I think my suggestion would be even if council wanted to go and in a different direction, you could always give staff that direction to research whatever it is you wanted us to research, but we would probably take that on separate and apart from the\nSpeaker 3: housing element, because we do believe that it complies with the legal requirements and we need to get it certified by the state.\nSpeaker 1: Understood. Thank you. Last item I want to I want to comment on is around the concern around homeownership rates, especially among Bipoc community members. And I want to make sure that we do add in there that we are going to be taking specific actions to increasing the numbers and opportunities for homeownership.\nSpeaker 1: If I'm looking at the number right. We have homeownership of African-American black at 24%, land next to 29 Asian, while not disaggregated, is at 41%. And white a little higher. So I want to make sure that we're creating a fair, more fair process for a pathway to homeownership.\nSpeaker 1: And so I want to make sure that we're putting in place language there and where we're being able to provide the programing and resource to do so. Thank you, Councilwoman. Yes, there's a program in the plan program 3.3 around home ownership assistance.\nSpeaker 1: We then hear this feedback from the community and in reviewing other recent plans, including the framework for reconciliation, about the disparity in homeownership rates and the importance of continuing to create and support those opportunities. And so Program 3.3 related to homeownership assistance includes actions for pursuing funding sources and tools to provide additional homebuyer assistance.\nSpeaker 1: It recognizes our new Recovery Act funding for down payment programs and direct directs us over the next few years to look at additional models to create both homeownership opportunities as well as community ownership of land.\nSpeaker 0: You you comfortable.\nSpeaker 1: Price? Thank you. So a couple of questions. First of all, I think I may have said 20% of the RINO requirement is is a part of this effort. It's 10%. So I apologize for that. The question I had, I'm really focused on senior housing.\nSpeaker 1: I think we we are in deep need of senior specific housing in Long Beach and more specifically, senior housing that also allows for some mixed use development so that we can address some of the mobility issues and challenges that we see with seniors being having the opportunity to walk to things as opposed to drive.\nSpeaker 1: And I think that's a major issue. We just really don't have any good senior housing that has vacancy capacity right now in the city. So to everyone's point, I mean, we can we can sit up here and say a lot of things that might be pleasing to some and just pleasing to in others philosophical type statements.\nSpeaker 1: But the reality is we we can't just say we're going to take all this affordable housing and put it here or put it there because we're not the ones that are developing the housing. Right. So the parameters that we're using to distribute the housing allocations are based on what policies and programs are available through our state and\nSpeaker 1: local partners and federal partners in terms of what incentives will be provided, what credits will be provided, that type of thing. Am I correct on all of that?\nSpeaker 2: Councilman, this is Patricia Devendorf. That is correct. To a large degree. There's also just the the very technical requirements for the site inventory. The state does dictate the law does dictate that you cannot count as a site for affordable housing, low income housing, unless the area zoned for a certain density and unless the site is of a\nSpeaker 2: certain size. So that is how the technical analysis that staff did looked at those factors to to determine that distribution, if you will.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And I appreciate that, because I just want to make sure I think just how those allocations are made is. It's not really an arbitrary decision by staff. There are some legal parameters that define where certain housing can go.\nSpeaker 1: And then, of course, now on top of that, you're dealing with a private developer who has to get some sort of return on the investment. And so you're also being realistic. So, I mean, we could we can make declarations here.\nSpeaker 1: I'd love to see more affordable housing here or there, and that might generate applause or boos of heaven. But the reality is, in practical application, there are certain limitations to where housing can go. What type of housing zoning has to do with it, and our partners have to do with it.\nSpeaker 1: And just without having you go into it, you're considered all of that factored into this proposal? Yes, we did. Okay. Is there any opportunity in your mind that you have in terms of the recommendations you're making to make any changes to that, to accommodate more affordable housing in other parts of the city that you feel you haven't\nSpeaker 1: considered?\nSpeaker 2: The mixed income strategy in general and just housing more housing production overall is going to be important. Looking at the lower density zones. One of the programs is to look at the lower density zones or areas of the city and come up with zoning strategies that allow for leasing in of additional units, duplexes, triplexes the what we\nSpeaker 2: talked about the courtyard, housing or bungalows. These are all typologies that exist throughout the city and the current zoning doesn't really allow it or not allow it very easily. So the zoning code update would look at creating zones that would facilitate that kind of development in the lower density multifamily or the lower density areas of the city\nSpeaker 1: . Like the east side.\nSpeaker 2: Like that, you said.\nSpeaker 1: And would that allow also for moderate senior and lower income housing?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: And that's been factored into the plan.\nSpeaker 2: The proposal that is part of these strategies. That would be part of the implementation of the plan. Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think that's a priority for everybody and I appreciate that. I mean, obviously, we want you to use best practices and what's accepted in your industry to make that reality possible here, because we have such a diverse city, and I appreciate that you've done that.\nSpeaker 1: I'm taking your word for it since this is your area of expertize and not mine. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Council members in the.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Austin. And thank you, Patricia Nelson, for this great report. Thank you to our housing advocates for always.\nSpeaker 2: Supporting affordable housing for everyone.\nSpeaker 1: And thank you carpenters for showing up big. I'm really excited to have you guys here. One of the things that I feel is two basic needs for people is want to have food on their table and to to have a roof over their head.\nSpeaker 1: Housing is one of the most important topics we can discuss and address. The lack of rent affordability pre-pandemic affects us all. But in particular, it has place. It has placed the heaviest of burdens on people of color, seniors and low income communities and this housing crisis in and equitable.\nSpeaker 1: And it has exacerbated it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Rents are just way too high and reaching a point beyond what our residents, including myself, can afford. The governor in 2019 signed the rent cap to address the burden statewide, but there are also ways we can address this locally.\nSpeaker 1: First and foremost, through through our housing element. I would like to ask, can staff speak to the implementation of rent control items within our housing element? Would a temporary rent control help alleviate this or are our current housing crisis?\nSpeaker 2: Councilwoman, thank you for your question. The plan does have a program that deals with that rent stabilization. It is program 7.2. Currently, the program, the action 7.22 talks about exploring additional housing programs such as rent stabilization and tenant landlord mediation services.\nSpeaker 2: And it's the time frame associated with that is to provide a report on successful programs in nearby jurisdictions to the Council by 2023 as a means to start to explore that that option.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for answering that. As we move forward, we need to do all that we can and do our best to ensure that those who are living in Long Beach now and who are made.\nSpeaker 2: You know, who are made.\nSpeaker 1: To live in Long Beach, can stay and continue living in Long Beach as tenants. We all know that the house population in Long Beach are tenants. And also we know that a lot of them are being displaced by all of the high rents all across the city.\nSpeaker 1: So it is very important to me to highlight that and to address that that that element will guide our development process for the next eight years. We must build enough affordable housing to address our current and future situations.\nSpeaker 1: Last time the land use element came to us, it was a missed opportunity. That's what I keep hearing from all sorts of, you know, from developers, from housing advocates. This time around, we must get it right. We must get it right.\nSpeaker 1: It is something that is very important for the next eight years here in Long Beach, for all of our and for all of us here in this city. So I thank you again for for that. And I support the motion on the floor and really, really, really am looking forward to seeing a really great land use element\nSpeaker 1: going forward.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. So I'll take a couple of seconds of privilege to ask a few questions. I wanted to go back to to Rina. And can you just remind us how often those those numbers are adjusted?\nSpeaker 2: So pardon me as a strategy for the for the arena is determined kind of at the state and regional level and allocations are made to the individual cities through the Look the Metropolitan Planning Organization, which is skog for the Southern California region.\nSpeaker 2: They are updated every eight years as part of the cycle of doing housing elements.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, so we won't be dealing with a moving target in terms of our arena numbers as we adopt this housing element?\nSpeaker 2: No, we should not be.\nSpeaker 0: All right. And I just want to appreciate all of the the really diligent work from staff, but also the council to deal with our housing crisis. We have, week after week come up with different strategies, different approaches to to recognize the crisis that we're in and do as much as we can to to encourage growth in housing\nSpeaker 0: production in our cities with a handful of development projects that I'm dealing with in my district alone. I can tell you that is very frustrating and cumbersome, the process of just going back and forth, the negotiations, the entitlement process.\nSpeaker 0: And then when you finally get to construction, there's still challenges. Most housing developments take several years to get to come to reality. And so we're going to make this happen within eight years. That means that we should have most of our projects queued up within the next two or three years to try to reach and achieve that\nSpeaker 0: goal of what is like 25,000 new housing in the city. So I think it's aspirational, it's doable, but it's going to be a very aggressive approach. It's going to require the cooperation of a lot of private property owners to help us realize that.\nSpeaker 0: And so I think that's the missing element. When we look at plans on paper, it does require an element that we don't control to come to the table. And so we have developed a method prong, strategic approach to creating better options and opportunities.\nSpeaker 0: And so I think we need to continue to keep our foot on the grass and be aggressive gas and be aggressive in doing so. I'm certainly supportive of this this element because of the the work that has gone into getting us to this point.\nSpeaker 0: My my quick question for. Our staff is. Do you feel like the plan before us is will it be compliant with HCB?\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember. We are hoping so that the strategy that we outlined and the ways in which we responded. Staff have responded to the feedback we believe is is sufficient and has gone above and beyond what many other cities are doing.\nSpeaker 2: So that is our hope and we just have to submit it again and see if that is the case.\nSpeaker 0: And I'll just add my my comments as well that I'd like to see this this plan, to the best extent possible, be less segregated, you know, to to extend options, opportunities and areas of the city that have not traditionally been open to to new housing or affordable housing.\nSpeaker 0: I think we need to build all types of housing, but affordable is a priority for our city at this point. My office recently did a survey of our our residents over the last couple of weeks about livability and trying to understand what their values are in terms of livability.\nSpeaker 0: And it was very glaring that the the category of housing affordability was the area that was rated the lowest. Right. And so it's clear that we have work to do as a city, and I'll be committed to doing that.\nSpeaker 0: And we're partners as well. And then I wanted to just just address that one last point. Is there an area of our housing element or requirement by HPD to deal with the issue of workforce in terms of building new new housing?\nSpeaker 0: Is there a way to get that in there in any way?\nSpeaker 3: We don't believe so in this document and the housing element. So obviously when the city is financially involved in a project, depending on that value of that project, labor agreements come into play on affordable projects that receive public subsidy.\nSpeaker 3: Prevailing wage provisions come into play. But we don't believe there's a mechanism for those projects that are purely private, privately initiated, privately funded and executed on private property. We don't believe there's a mechanism for the city to require specific labor provisions on those projects.\nSpeaker 3: That requirement would need to come from the state.\nSpeaker 0: Well, what about. I guess I'm out of time, but what about projects that may have public funding as incentives? Could could we? And can we encourage or do we have any leverage to.\nSpeaker 3: Well, we can always encourage and we can use the power of persuasion. And I think this council always have that power. And we'd be glad to work with you on individual projects. But it really comes down to is there public money and the project and how much?\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember Price.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And that's a really great point. I want to use an example of that, which was the second development. There was no obligation by the developers to use any union labor, but we were I was very involved in that project.\nSpeaker 1: We worked very closely with them, we introduced them, made all the right connections, encouraged the parties to speak. And I think it was the result was a relationship that used skilled labor and the developers were very pleased with the outcome.\nSpeaker 1: So I think project to project that opportunity is there, the developer has to be open to it and certainly that's a question that can be asked at the early stages of the discussions with the developers so that they can factor in any additional costs that they think would be associated with those partnership into their proposal.\nSpeaker 1: But I know at Second and PCH, that was a major effort that we worked on and that developer was under no obligation whatsoever to use union labor. And the fact that they came to the table and came to the table the way they did was very impressive.\nSpeaker 1: And as a result, we have a very high quality project.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Then concludes the comments from behind the rail. We've heard the public comment and so I would entertain. That's taken a vote.\nSpeaker 3: Motion carries.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 4: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. We're now at item 14.\nSpeaker 4: Communication from council member your INGO Councilwoman Price council member super non recommendation to request the city manager to prepare a study session for the Customs facility to be heard at the City Council meeting on December 13, 2016.\nSpeaker 3: Councilor Maria Ringo.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mayor. First of all, I want to thank my council colleagues, Suzy Price and Councilmember Gareth O'Connell, for staying on to this item. Thank you for your support. And I want to thank the residents who are here this evening and those who are not here who but sent in emails and phone calls communicating their ideas on\nSpeaker 6: this issue. I have been listening to your concerns about the timing of this issue and also about the fact that they want their voices heard and they're not here because of the holiday season. I strongly believe that we should not be voting on this item this week or next week, that we should hear it first as a\nSpeaker 6: study session. It's always important that when we deal with items such important, such as this, that we have a study session. First, give the opportunity for our public to state their case, to give their ideas and voice their concerns about any project, whether it's this one or that we did with the Civic Center and other items that\nSpeaker 6: come before us that they should have an opportunity to to share their thoughts. I would also like to say that we had four community meetings to commission meetings, and we had a great extensive dialog on this. However, it has not been presented as a study session to the City Council as a whole, and that's important.\nSpeaker 6: Given the large community interest. I encourage and ask that my colleagues discuss this item as a study session in lieu of hearing it as an action item next week. Please give this item the opportunity to be heard, to have questions answered, and to receive additional testimony prior to a vote of the City Council.\nSpeaker 6: I had an opportunity to review the report. I still have many questions regarding the report and the recommendations that are made in it. And I also want to ensure that my council colleagues do the same and that they all should be given the opportunity to hear the staff report as we study session, develop the questions and then\nSpeaker 6: come back in January for further consideration. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. The second there was councilman.\nSpeaker 1: So I. I read the item a bit differently, and I'm in support of this motion because under the way that I read it, while I had hoped we would have a study session tonight so that we would have that time and that gap, I know that originally there was some concern that there might be a council member\nSpeaker 1: who admits, and then there were some back and forth. So I appreciate that this item was scheduled. But does the motion currently say anything about and supportive of a study session? And my understanding of the item is that we're going to do it next Tuesday.\nSpeaker 1: Wonderful. I'm supportive of that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Councilman asked the.\nSpeaker 7: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank Councilmember Urunga and the rest of the council Price and Supernova for bringing this item forward. And I will just say that I will be in support of this item.\nSpeaker 7: I think it's a it makes a good, logical sense to to hear the study session or have a study session before the city council. I know we had at least two other study sessions from Jacobs Engineering, one before the Airport Advisory Commission and the other before the Economic Development Commission.\nSpeaker 7: I attended at least one of those study sessions, and I know at least a couple of my colleagues were able to do it. But I'm not sure and I'm pretty sure that all nine city council members did not have that opportunity.\nSpeaker 7: I think it's from a from a fairness process, due process standpoint. It makes a lot of good sense for us to have a study session here, more for the council to make sure that, you know, we get the the the information and we are making informed decisions.\nSpeaker 7: The Jacobs engineering study was close to 700 pages. I have toiled through most of that, actually, the entire study, and I'm on going on my second pass at this point. I would encourage all my colleagues to look at that.\nSpeaker 7: And if the public has not had an opportunity to read that full study, to read that as well, I want to make sure that this council and I think your council member, you his motion actually accomplishes that. Make sure that we are we are fully informed before we make a very, very critical decision.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I want to thank my colleague, Councilman Ranga, for bringing this forward. I know that it's very important to him that the community have an opportunity to weigh in and also that council make this decision completely mindful of all the questions that might be raised by members of the community or our fellow council colleagues.\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that. I have to read the report. I haven't read all of the appendices, although I did read Appendix H and I've worked closely with staff to answer several of the questions that I have. We've also been inundated in terms of our council office with telephone calls and emails over the last two weeks.\nSpeaker 2: It looks like we received 69 emails in favor of moving forward to asking that we not vote immediately or vote no on it and for asking for a delay. So we've definitely engaged our community. I signed on to this item because as my colleagues now, and I think it's just inherent in my nature, I probably would never\nSpeaker 2: object to an opportunity to be educated further on something and learn more. So I think having a study session is good. And and also the way I read the item is that we can have a study session and that we need to have a study session before we're to vote on this item.\nSpeaker 2: Whether that happens at the next meeting or in the future. That is up to the council. But that's how I read the item and that's how I read it. When I signed on to it. So I appreciate the intent behind the item and look forward to hearing from my colleagues.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: And just to get a point of clarification, I know that I was able to watch the economic development presentation related to the Jacobson study. Is that still available online for any member of the city council to watch and including the public comment and community input?\nSpeaker 5: Yes, it should be on the register.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I know it had been. And so I encourage people to watch it immediately because I also think that if you have those questions, are we able to submit those questions to Mr. Mayes so that we would be able to have answers to our questions at any time?\nSpeaker 1: Because I know you answer my questions any time a resident brings up a an idea that I think we need to explore that I hadn't yet heard a response on.\nSpeaker 10: As Councilwoman Mongo, we try to answer all those questions as soon as we can, and if we can't answer them, we work with airport staff to get answers for you.\nSpeaker 1: So people can continue to ask questions. The comment is not open for next Tuesday. I'm sorry. Yes, for next Tuesday. Yet I hear it's only open 72 hours in advance. But that's our standard policy.\nSpeaker 5: I think that simply looked at the city clerk who runs that system to give us some input on that.\nSpeaker 1: So the agenda item.\nSpeaker 5: At 72 hours to go as he comments is enabled Friday around Friday at 430. So Monday, Tuesday at 4:00.\nSpeaker 1: I would like to add a friendly as a second day of the motion.\nSpeaker 3: She's got a friendly.\nSpeaker 1: As a friendly to this item because I'm supportive of additional public input. Would you be open to opening public comment as soon as feasibly possible from the city clerk's office so that people who are emailing our offices could engage with each comment?\nSpeaker 1: So it's all part of the public record and available to all of us at the dais during the night. So should those questions need to be answered on the standard policy that maybe we need to look at as a city is only 72 hours in advance, but I think that this item is of great importance.\nSpeaker 1: And I'd like to ask that we ask the city clerk to open that you comment if this item passes.\nSpeaker 6: I was back when I was talking to my chief of staff. I was asking that very question. Perfect. And in regards to making availability for access to two comments, there have been many, many emails already that are available for you to review on the website, if I'm not mistaken, with the airport airtight.\nSpeaker 6: So that's already there and I would certainly agree to that. Mean, I think it's important that that individuals who will not be able to here to be here, but are viewing it and would want to comment on it.\nSpeaker 6: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 1: And then look on our legislator, typically it seems like there's a back end where it says the number of items that have come in for against.\nSpeaker 2: Or.\nSpeaker 1: General comment, those are not typically activated. Is there a reason why that could not be activated for this item?\nSpeaker 3: We don't use that feature.\nSpeaker 1: Do we? Paid for it. Is it available.\nSpeaker 3: That. I'm not sure.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Then I will wait and hear how that works because I see it on my register, but I see 15 public comments on an item or two and the little green and the little red don't ever change. So just a thought.\nSpeaker 1: If we're paying for a service we should utilize.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And next up, I have Councilmember Supernova, please.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I have a history on this particular issue. It goes back to last summer. I've been on the public record as opposing anything that comes to city council during the holiday season. Ironically, the press telegram, who I believe supports the office, agrees with me on that issue.\nSpeaker 5: So I'd like to quote Press Telegram editorial board from August 18th. Says Supervisor, right, in wanting enough time to have quality committee meetings before final action is taken by the council. The timetable should work as long as there aren't delays, which would push the issue into the busy November December holiday season when decisions on major issues like\nSpeaker 5: this are difficult to make. That's from a supporter of the FISA. So I would like to introduce a substitute motion. That we put off both the study session and the vote until after the new year.\nSpeaker 3: There is a substitute motion to put off both the study session and the issue coming before council, the one that comes from staff till after the holiday season. That was at the last part after the first of the year.\nSpeaker 7: I'll second.\nSpeaker 3: That. So there's a motion and a second to put them both off after the first of the year. That's the motion on the floor. I'm going to continue going down the line, councilman, or anything else.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. I'd like to reserve further comment till after we hear public comment.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. Councilman, do you want to go now or you want to go to a public comment first? Okay. Why don't. Clarifying question. Sure. Councilor McGovern.\nSpeaker 1: City attorney. The vote today is on when we do a study session. Or it was, but now it's not. But if we approved the study session. Well, I guess they should go back a step. If Councilmember Supernova's item was not approved.\nSpeaker 1: The vote next Tuesday would only be. Could you clarify what the vote? It's the scoping, which is not the yes or no on whether or not we're going international. I guess I just want people to know that the vote that we're taking either tonight or next Tuesday, depending on what series of items fail or succeed, tonight is\nSpeaker 1: not the final vote on whether or not we're having an international terminal. I think that that. Could you provide some clarity that.\nSpeaker 10: That's absolutely correct, as I understand it. And if there are no further substitute motions, if Councilman Supernova's motion were to pass the entire matter, that is the study session and any vote up or down on CFIUS would be postponed until after the first of the year.\nSpeaker 10: That is until January or until sometime in 2017. If that motion fails, we go back to the original motion, which is to conduct a study session next Tuesday in front of the Council regarding the FISA.\nSpeaker 1: And currently on the agenda.\nSpeaker 6: I want to clarify though, if there will be a study session, but no vote taken that evening.\nSpeaker 1: I don't read the item that way.\nSpeaker 10: Well, almost the motion.\nSpeaker 3: Let's hold on 1/2. So let me just just I just want to get a lot of people lighting up here. Okay. I want to clarify where we are. It's very important. So just to be very clear where we are right now.\nSpeaker 3: There's a substitute motion on the floor by Councilmember Supernova, and the substitute motion essentially postpones any study session or initial staff discussion or and or vote on the FISA issue until after the first of the year. That's the study session that that is that is a substitute motion currently on the floor.\nSpeaker 3: Correct. Okay. And if if that motion were to move forward, then that happens after the first of the year, if it were to fail. Let me go back to the original motion, which is the motion by Councilmember Durango, seconded by Councilwoman Stacy Mango, which is to have a study session next Tuesday, which still does not preclude the\nSpeaker 3: council from moving forward on the staff driven motion on Tuesday night, or it could be postponed next would depend on the council decision then and of the friendly amendment that you made about allowing the comments to open up as soon as possible.\nSpeaker 3: So those are the two motions on the floor. Are there any other clarifying questions on that?\nSpeaker 1: So so just so we're clear, as I read the press telegram, which I support, Councilmember Supernova and that opinion that the vote shouldn't be taken during the holidays, that vote is not being taken during the holidays because we as a council cannot vote on the international terminal right now because we have a current currently we don't have\nSpeaker 1: enough information. We don't know the size, scope, cost, any of those things because several months ago, this council made an action to not allow the city staff to talk to any tenants about anything. And so. We don't have the information to take that vote.\nSpeaker 1: And that vote would take place in January. Correct. After staff, should you get direction? Potentially next week. You would then bring that back. Sometime in the new year, not even necessarily in January, but potentially January, February, March? Who knows?\nSpeaker 1: I'm confused.\nSpeaker 3: Mr. Mays, do you want me to explain it or do you want to go ahead?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm clear. I'm hoping Mr. Mays will explain what he explained very clearly in my office earlier to the public and other members of the council. But thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Mr. Mays.\nSpeaker 10: So as it stands right now, we have a motion on the floor that would continue the entire matter until January of next year or after January, but no sooner than January of next year. That would be a study session and an action item to direct city staff to take next steps that would be put off until after\nSpeaker 10: the first of the year. If that motion were to fail, we go back to the original motion, which is to conduct a study session next Tuesday. And as I understood the motion from Councilmember Durango, as he explained it, his intent is only to have a study session session next Tuesday.\nSpeaker 10: I think possibly some of the confusion is that already submitted to the city clerk is an additional staff driven item also set for December 13, which actually would, if it were, if the staff recommendation were passed that evening, would direct city staff to take next steps.\nSpeaker 10: And that next step would not be to approve the office facility. It would be to, in essence, direct staff to engage with the applicant, JetBlue, to get more details on what their proposed project would actually look like and what the financial ramifications of that project would be, both for JetBlue and the city.\nSpeaker 10: So conceivably, if we end up with the original motion, the study session could take place. And as long as that city staff driven council letter remains in place, an action item would be on the agenda that would direct if past staff to move forward with a next step, but not approval of the office.\nSpeaker 1: Wonderful. Thank you. That's exactly what I needed to hear.\nSpeaker 3: Great. Thank you. Let me go back to Councilman Pearce. Do you want to go to do you want to go ahead and go or go? Do you want to go now? I'm sorry. No, absolutely. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 9: I just want to echo something that you said that's very important. If we did take a vote next Tuesday. That vote is not. We're opening up a customs facility tomorrow. That vote is to have staff work with the applicant.\nSpeaker 9: And that that itself is not necessarily a final approval of a start of a terminal. I mean.\nSpeaker 10: That that's absolutely correct, because even if you direct staff to take the next steps before the city council could approve any office facility, there'll also have to be a lot of other work done, including an environmental analysis that would be necessary for any final approval by the City Council.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you so very much for that. And I will hold my grandstanding for later.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks for your announcement.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So let me let me go. So request to go to the public comment on this. So please come forward. Everyone, if you're going to speak, please come forward to the podium. Thank you. My goal is working with.\nSpeaker 3: There was two motions on the floor right now, the substitute and the original Reykjavik.\nSpeaker 1: I am I am so angry right now. I had 3 minutes of comments and suggestions to make to you. But Mike, I can't believe that you just shared that with them. And I cannot believe that you're falling for the emotion next week.\nSpeaker 1: If you pass this, this will be the same thing that happened with the Civic Center when you were just coming into office on Don't Look at me like that, Stacy and Mock Me. Shame on you. You know you're supposed to be representing your people, don't.\nSpeaker 3: You, Councilwoman? Let's please continue with the public comment. Oh, thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Okay, so question Susie, you.\nSpeaker 1: Said you had 69 for 22 against it and four to delay it. I'm going to guess only guessing that the 69 four came from the JetBlue club members. I don't know if you know that or you don't know that.\nSpeaker 1: And to say the next steps, again, I have to say to say the next steps means that that plane has left the gate. Okay. Please do not do that. Please move this to the other side of the holidays so that all of your constituents, those for it and opposed to it, will be part of this most serious\nSpeaker 1: development in this city. You are about to impact so many neighborhoods that have been fought for for decades. I'd also like you to include, if you will, that the that the study session when if and when you do have it or when you do have it.\nSpeaker 1: That includes the invited testimony of former Long Beach Airport Advisory Commissioner Doug Halbert. Doug is our elected city prosecutor, and he previously served as a contracted city attorney for multiple area cities. He deserves an invited opportunity to be heard and to speak more than 180 seconds to answer your questions.\nSpeaker 1: Based on his very important testimony in February 2015 that he gave to the Airport Advisory Commission, Mr. Halbert told the AEC that, in his opinion, allowing international flights could increase the risk of a potentially catastrophic challenge to our noise ordinance.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, the city attorney's office holds a different opinion. That's fine. It simply means that both you, as our decision makers and the impacted public, should hear and be subject to some scrutiny. Both sides and opinion being heard. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: John Slattery. Addresses on file. I think the big hope here and I think it was Councilman Price said, is I myself have not even had a chance to get through this thing. It's it's big. I don't know how many of you have you guys have staff?\nSpeaker 5: I don't. I think the ability for us to actually have a true study session, that's for the public. And I would also hope that you guys have a true study session. I was at the economic development. That's not a study session.\nSpeaker 5: That was just basically a presentation just from the stuff I've seen within there. This document is not complete. And I think really when you look at it, you know, it's already been said is if we didn't do this feasibility study, we're going to be sued.\nSpeaker 5: And now I'm starting to hear also that even if we say no after the feasibility study, we'll probably be sued. I think the city needs to take a stand. This is our airport. We're going to set up the way we want to set it up and that we should not be kowtowing to one business or I should\nSpeaker 5: say one customer. In 2001, I think was when they came in, they promised, hey, we gave them all these slots and they promised, we're going to fill it up to this day. They have yet to be able to utilize all those slots.\nSpeaker 5: Why are we going to put our the airport itself at financial risk when they can't fill up those international slots? But I so again, I just hope that you guys move this into the next year so that we as a public have a chance for a true study session with questions and answers and that you guys look\nSpeaker 5: at this as a true study session with questions and answers, not just a presentation of what's there. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Is there any other public comment or just my last one, please? Your last one for the night? Gerald Meneghini. No. I'm presently sitting on the Long Beach Airport Advisory Commission and have as such for eight years now.\nSpeaker 3: I was there when Doug Halbert made his presentation to us and I did hear what he had to say. As I have heard what's been said over and over for 20 some years, that we are always going to be facing a threat of somebody coming in to challenge it for one reason or the other.\nSpeaker 3: What I'm hearing from everybody so far tonight and gee, it was a short line was is that. I think rather than delay we're talking about. They don't want it. They don't want it. Please, not in our neighborhoods, please.\nSpeaker 3: No international service for Long Beach. And I think that's an unfair assessment of the situation. I think at this point that what we need to do is carefully listen to everything. And and I take real umbrage with the fact that the information in that 679 page book, that presentation has been available since October.\nSpeaker 3: It's been out there. So when are we going to finish reading it and when are we going to get down to studying it? And that's all I ask tonight, is that you consider studying it because what better thing to do on that holiday weekend than to curl up with 700 pages of a FISA feasibility study?\nSpeaker 3: So again, I said I am a sitting member of that commission. But tonight what you're hearing are strictly the rants of a citizen and a resident of Roberto around his council district. I thank you for your service. I think you'll always do the right thing, and I think we owe it at this point to make a make\nSpeaker 3: a choice to go forward and to learn more. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Hi. Laurie Smith, third district. I do not I'm not impacted by the airplanes coming in to the airport, as Jerry mentioned. And I attended the airport advisory commission meetings. I'm concerned, as I spoke to you early about the airport advisory chair and vice chair and their conflict of interest issues that have been filed with the California Fair\nSpeaker 2: Political Practices Commission and the L.A. County DA's office head Deputy Public Integrity Division. The Airport Advisory Commission is seeking to recommend to City Council to build a customs facility at the airport where they have a financial interest. And this could possibly impair the motivation of the entire commission.\nSpeaker 2: As I mentioned you, the city council have appointed the Airport Advisory Commission members and advise you and they advise you regarding airport related issues so that if there is a conflict of interest that is found with the two entities I mentioned earlier, when you the council, the city council itself will then be in jeopardy of your integrity\nSpeaker 2: . I requested the city council study session be postponed until the matters of impropriety involving the chair and the vice chair of the Airport Advisory Commission members. The business, which involved their financial dealings, which also include the city of Long Beach and JetBlue, have been addressed and resolved.\nSpeaker 2: These issues are currently under consideration by both the DA's office and the CAA, APC, and therefore I ask you to postpone the study session. The Long Beach, the city of Long Beach manages the airport and is ultimately responsible for the decisions made regarding it.\nSpeaker 2: I'm shocked that you don't know the things that I know. I only saw three of you. Austin, your Ranga and Supernova Community Meetings regarding this topic when a multitude of residents attended and there has been a limited amount of time to engage the residents.\nSpeaker 2: As these conflict of interest issues impact the City Council study session i. I would it would be prudent for you to withhold any further scheduling of the city session and vote until the conflict of interest issues are investigated.\nSpeaker 2: Furthermore, I'm confused and confused about allowing council members request about allowing the council members request about your comments. How do you know that the people that are commenting live in the city? There is a JetBlue email that was sent to anyone about sending emails to the city council to approve the fire study session.\nSpeaker 2: I only reporting this to you tomorrow. How do you know that the commenters live in the city? Do you require address and name of people? Are only residents allowed to make comments and are they checked? These are questions I would like you to answer tonight.\nSpeaker 2: And also, I don't think it's necessary that, you know how many people are voting, whether to approve it or not approve it. That just lets me know that JetBlue marketing staff needs to work harder to spam people to to get you guys to vote the way they want you to.\nSpeaker 2: So I appreciate you allowing our comments and I look forward to your vote.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Joe Sopko fifth District kept my address and file a mayor, city council members and staff. When you all were elected, you swore to protect the noise ordinance. I think I heard it out of all your mouths. That includes the city attorney and certainly the mayor.\nSpeaker 5: But what does that mean? Protect the noise ordinance. One thing you haven't done is stop the late night flights. This comes out public information. It's just obvious. Picked up August 2016. And you haven't stopped the homeless from the planes from coming in over the neighborhoods between 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. That's the most sensitive time.\nSpeaker 5: You haven't stopped that. And the worst violator is paying the city thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And that money's going to the library. Now, that's a hell of a way to run the general budget, to rely on fines to pay for the library.\nSpeaker 5: But we're getting it. And it seems that you're all happy because no one's changing anything. I mean, the money should go to the library. That's where it's set up. But those flights should not be taking place. This August 2016 was from the airport, and it said that the month of August, JetBlue flew in between 11 p.m. to\nSpeaker 5: 7 a.m. over your house, let's say. How would you like it? 19 times between ten and 11. The the approved time that we give him a break. 22 times. Uh, 2015. They flew over and they and they got 15 or 15 penalties.\nSpeaker 5: They paid thousands of dollars in fines for our libraries. And then the same thing. From 10 to 11, there was 2014, 20. They're not going to stop flying over the top of the house. JetBlue is the biggest violator of our noise ordinance.\nSpeaker 5: And here we're talking about giving them our airport, giving the international flights. This is real basic. How would you train your children if you had children to raise? Hear, hear. Don't do that. Don't do that. Oh, let me reward you for it.\nSpeaker 5: That's what we're doing. Rewarding JetBlue. And what do you think is going to happen when you reward them with that FISA of the international flights? You think they're going to stop coming in late? You guys are, you're on this issue.\nSpeaker 5: You're terrible representatives. And if these were your children, you're terrible parents. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Next speaker, please. I was born, Joy. I live at 4620 Virginia Avenue in Long Beach. In 2001, the city.\nSpeaker 5: Attorney's office was proven wrong after it told the council and the public.\nSpeaker 3: That it wouldn't risk our airport ordinance to change the airport's flight slot allocation rules. The exact opposite happened when the council made the change to suit JetBlue. It triggered a 2002 FAA inquiry, and we were nearly sued by American Airlines for that.\nSpeaker 5: For the record, Mr. Harvard among members.\nSpeaker 3: Of the of the ATC along with Long Beach US to who saved our airport from permanent destruction from bad.\nSpeaker 5: Advice recommended by another hired consultant.\nSpeaker 3: That consultant advised expanding our permanent terminal facilities to over 30% larger than they are today. That would have destroyed the airports, boutique right size, the travelers love and wins awards. Thankfully, a former council body didn't rubberstamp what a consultant recommended, which is why we have the right to size the airport we have today.\nSpeaker 3: It seems clear to me, as.\nSpeaker 5: Just a resident listening to the comments here tonight, that there are multiple issues that are.\nSpeaker 3: Influencing this decision that are not very well known or understood by the constituents in your districts and perhaps by some council members. It stands to reason that the public and your constituents are not going to have time to learn very much about some of these issues between now and this time a week from now.\nSpeaker 3: I urge you to postpone this vote until we can all figure out all the things that are influencing your vote. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker, please. Mr. Last Speaker, I want to close the speaker's list. Looks like it.\nSpeaker 3: I'm going. There are other speakers. Please come forward so I can see who's left. So two other speakers. Okay. The lady in the back will be our last speaker. I'm closing the speaker's list now. Others. Okay, so the next three and then we're close.\nSpeaker 3: Speakers, please. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. I'm Robert Land represent. I am a member of the executive team at JetBlue Airways, 44 100 Donald Douglas Drive at the airport. I want to remind the council that this isn't just been a two year delay thus far to get to where we are tonight.\nSpeaker 3: Prior to the two years it's taken, just to get to the point of where do we go from here? JetBlue worked for at least two years and was urged by a prior airport director and a prior member of this council to postpone our asking.\nSpeaker 3: That led us to this two years. So we're in year four of this, the study, the exhaustive study that the city paid good money for that I think answered all the questions the council directed it to ask. Has been out for more than two months.\nSpeaker 3: During that more than two month period, there have been two exhaustive sessions. I attended both camps. When you Ringo. I saw you at both. It was terrific. And we support your motion this evening to have another study session for the council itself.\nSpeaker 3: But this is not an issue that's being, you know, ramrod it through. This is moving at a turtle's pace. Everyone's getting their chance to get questions answered. As far as the comment earlier about the councilwoman raised the number of emails she received.\nSpeaker 3: JetBlue doesn't tell its customers what to do. They tell us what to do. We respond to their needs. We informed them of the council's deliberations. We informed them of the Jacobs study. And we said, If you support this, here's a link to let members of your council know if they've responded in kind, then that's democracy.\nSpeaker 3: JetBlue didn't force anybody to do anything. You Council members in making this decision need to be informed and fully supports that, including next week's study session that I hope passes and is held in this chamber. But you can't be informed fully until Blue can work closely, which we were prohibited from 18 months ago to work closely with\nSpeaker 3: the airport staff and the city manager's office to provide all of the details and work an exchange of ideas and information on what this project would look like. So you can then make an informed decision. We pledged to do that immediately upon a vote that allows us to interact that way.\nSpeaker 3: We think the time for delays is over. I think earlier this evening you saw that the quote unquote holiday periods hardly stop this city from getting engaged and involved on issues of importance. And I applaud the city for taking up the Dakota pipeline issue.\nSpeaker 3: This room was full and passionate and you had to shorten the time. People got to speak because of it. And it's the holiday period. So in closing, JetBlue reiterates its support for the ordinance, the noise ordinance that we have defended, that we have given up assets to defend.\nSpeaker 3: And I remind the council that the FAA, as recently as October of this year, stated that proceeding with the FISA facility will in no way, no way whatsoever jeopardize the ordinance. Thank you very. Thank you very much. Last two speakers.\nSpeaker 3: Please come forward.\nSpeaker 4: Hi. Lavon Miller, eighth district. I'm confused as to why we're even talking about this, frankly, but to have something that I paid for, $350,000 for a study that contradicts itself in the appendices and the body. And, um, it's very confusing to me.\nSpeaker 9: I was very.\nSpeaker 4: Proud of Long Beach today when you stood with the against the Dakota Access Pipeline. You voted as one. And I'd really like to see you stand behind the neighborhoods in Long Beach and vote as one against this facility.\nSpeaker 4: And one last thing. When we're talking and when we have a study session and we come before you, especially when someone like Ray Gavlak, who has worked in this body herself.\nSpeaker 9: And comes up.\nSpeaker 4: To share something and is totally disrespected. I had to speak out against that. Stacey Mungo, you sat in the audience and talked to someone else while she was speaking. I think that's disrespectful. So anyway, I urge you all to put this off until after the holidays, because, quite frankly, I'd like to be home decorating my Christmas tree\nSpeaker 4: right now. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. On our last speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, counsel. Completely out of my comfort zone. I'm forcing myself to stand here and address you. I am a homeowner. I live on Studebaker. This is the first I'm hearing of this other than seeing a couple of signs in people's front yards.\nSpeaker 2: I don't even know what this means. I'm assuming that there hasn't been a lot of public outreach, so I just wanted to point that out. I'm thankful for the people who have spoken before me to bring this to my attention.\nSpeaker 2: How will I hear about this in the public? What do I need to know? Is if there's something happening with the airport. How will I know this as a resident of Long Beach? Anybody. Should I look in the local paper?\nSpeaker 2: What is the public outreach? I haven't heard about this, so I'm asking.\nSpeaker 3: Any of you where we go. What? I certainly I mean, besides obviously being in the press, which is there coverage of it, I'm certain, if you will, give us your email with the clerk at a minimum. And there's other information out there that's not city information.\nSpeaker 3: But at a minimum, we can send you everything that the city has that's online and that we have sent out on the issue. But I would also encourage you, there are other groups and there are other organizations have done their own research and other work.\nSpeaker 3: And those are will be available to you as well. But if you if you leave your email, we will get you everything that the city has and all the presentations.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I will look into that and I will give you my email. But the point is that I think I'm pretty well informed. I've been in this city for 20 years. My point is that there's probably not enough public outreach on this issue.\nSpeaker 2: And the other thing I would like to say is I agree with the woman before me sitting here in the audience tonight. It's so distracting to watch. Many of you have side conversations to move around, to sit back there, talk to people, come over here, talk to people, be on your phones, be on your tablets, taking care\nSpeaker 2: of other business. We're in the audience. We hear you whispering and talking. It's completely distracting and it's disrespectful to the people that come up here and and and speak to you about important issues. I'm I'm surprised by this.\nSpeaker 2: When we come into these chambers, I'm sure you demand a certain amount of respect. And I don't think that many of you are giving that same respect by not paying attention to the people that are at this podium saying very important things to you on very important issues.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Okay. That closes public comment. We're going to go back to the council. I have some speakers here. So Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I think that what we need to do is gain more information. So what I'd like to do is make a substitute substitute motion and I'm open to additional input or friendlies from my colleagues to bring the study session and additional information sought after by the staff in engaging with the tenants back to this Council January 24th\nSpeaker 1: . So in the spirit of Mr. Councilmember Supernova's substitute motion, it would move the study session and the vote until after the holidays. Including but not limited to Martin Luther King Day. And it would also give the city staff the appropriate amount of time to engage with our tenants so we know what we're voting on.\nSpeaker 1: So I would be interested in knowing information related to. What are we specifically looking at? Where would it go? How many flights would we anticipate would utilize the facility? How much would the facility cost? How big would the facility be?\nSpeaker 1: All the things that I think we need to know before making a decision to move forward or not to move forward. And so I'd like to with that here from my colleagues. And when I say tenants, I don't just mean one tenant who put in an application.\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to know impact on all of our tenants. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. There isn't a second yet, so I'm just going to keep going down the list. Count some Boston.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. And I believe there. There is a second to the motion on the floor. I am obviously supportive of. I'll wait. I'm I'm obviously supportive of of moving the the conversation until after the holidays. I can remember 2015 being a very tough December for for this council.\nSpeaker 7: We took a lot of very serious votes. And, you know, the holiday was certainly impacted by that. And so I think in the spirit of just, you know, making sure that we have a of a warm holiday season or holiday season that we can celebrate not only the council, but this entire city and community.\nSpeaker 7: I think it's the spirit of your motion. Is is is something that I'm willing to support after the holidays. However, I do have some concerns about opening up this this conversation and getting such information in advance of us truly studying the issue as a council.\nSpeaker 7: Right. We're on your own, almost on a dual track, right? You're on a dual track to say, yes, we want we're we're interested and we want to know more. And we we want to free our staff up to to have the conversations and get information in advance of the city council's really getting behind the idea.\nSpeaker 7: Right. And so if you were to modify your motion to have this study session in January and have the actual vote after we we actually have an opportunity to start to study the issue. The whole idea behind the study session is that this city council makes an informed decision.\nSpeaker 7: Right. And. I to your point, I know you're trying to get there, but but I just think it's it doesn't come off as genuine, right. In terms of really, really understanding and having a due process here.\nSpeaker 1: So I know you and I both experienced multiple study sessions and that our entire council had access to prior presentations online. And our entire council has access to the city staff, city attorneys to continue to do individual exploration including but not limited to just.\nSpeaker 1: Romo has come to community meetings in the fifth District and answered several questions that are on point. I'd be open to a couple of things. I'm not saying that we're interested. I'm saying we don't know what we're interested in.\nSpeaker 1: And so let me. I don't want to. I guess I could do an analogy, but I'm not saying. We're saying we're interested. I'm saying. We might want to go get a Christmas tree this year. And this is a debate in my family.\nSpeaker 1: Do we get a real Christmas tree or do we get an artificial Christmas tree? We don't even know what store to go to yet. And so within that context, I'd like them to come back. If you are hoping that this council has a study session in advance.\nSpeaker 1: I'm I am open to still having the study session next week and then having. All the information come back at a date certain in January so that we all know when to be here, what to expect. My residents want to know when is the vote going to really happen because they want to put it on their calendar\nSpeaker 1: and plan to come downtown. And we know how coming downtown is. And right now there's parking issues and other things. They want to plan. They want to carpool. They want to be a part of it, both yes and no sides.\nSpeaker 1: And what I don't want to do is leverage my neighbors to come two and three and four times. I want them to know that when they come. That we're going to have all the information because I think it's a very different story to say where we're going to move forward.\nSpeaker 1: But no one knows if we're talking about. $1,000,000 or 25 million. I mean, we really don't have anything in between. So are you open to do you still want to study session on the 13th and then everything in January or I will.\nSpeaker 7: I think we all came here prepared to do a study session on the 13th. Right. And I'm okay with doing a study session on the 13th. I've notified residents that the study session would happen on the 13th. So if you want a major motion, you're substitute substitute to say the 13th for a study session and then come\nSpeaker 7: back in January for a full consideration of this this issue. That's something that I can get behind and support. I think that's due process that I'm talking about. It gives this council an opportunity to get the information from the regarding the feasibility study, digest that information, develop questions, get do research based on questions that were may have\nSpeaker 7: come up then and then allow us all to have a nice holiday season as well.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to leave the floor open to listen to my colleagues because this might substitute substitute came from the. The information, both from councilmembers. Super Noor And to your point, when I had a community meeting last Monday, they wanted to know what's happening on the 13th.\nSpeaker 1: And I said, Quite honestly, I don't know because you don't know until you the sixth passes to what I can tell you what's gonna be on the agenda and posted because the staff report will be coming but I agree so but.\nSpeaker 7: I still have the floor, by the.\nSpeaker 0: Way. Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: I would, um. I know you put forth a substitute. Substitute? I would just ask as a friendly amendment that you direct staff to remove their item from from the 13th, from consideration until after we've had such study session.\nSpeaker 7: And that item comes back in January.\nSpeaker 1: So the way I currently have my motion worded, I may have not done it so eloquently, but the item would be the study session and the item that's currently agenda is for the 13th, all moved to the 25th with an additional component of information from the stuff through engagement with the tenants.\nSpeaker 1: That's where I am right now.\nSpeaker 7: I'll support Down.\nSpeaker 3: All right, somebody lingo.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. A lot of discussion here. Perhaps some confusion. And, you know, this last motion that was made right now, it's still not acceptable to me. Simple reason. Any studies say any item that includes a study session that ends in a vote is not acceptable.\nSpeaker 6: We can't do both at the same time. That that's my issue. You can't study something, say you're studying something, and then get a vote on it. It's like being in school. You studied and you take the test right away.\nSpeaker 6: You're not even given an opportunity to to go home and do some homework on it. I mean, that just doesn't work that way. A lot of people get, you know, failing grades because they cram. Then they before they call that set, they call that studying.\nSpeaker 6: That's not that's not studying. Studying is getting a report, getting all the information you you they have to give you asking questions. Having staff go back, researched a little more, coming back with the information that you requested via the study session that you had.\nSpeaker 6: I want more information on on the feasibility study. I want more, more, more information on the sequence issues, on the cost. I want all of that. Those are questions that those are questions that I have questions that are already being brought up but that we don't have answers to.\nSpeaker 6: We have some. Preliminary response to that, but not as a whole. And I'm not I'm sure that there's a lot more information out there. So any any motion at this point that puts both together as a as a study session and a vote I cannot support.\nSpeaker 6: And then we have the additional item that Councilmember Austin just brought up is that this debate is because we already have an agenda item for the 13th that says a staff report and then a vote. And I think that what my intent was with the original motion that I made was to remove the the the.\nSpeaker 6: The staff report portion of it. Do have to have a social study session and then move the vote to January. It'll give us a month or so. January 24th seems to be the appropriate date, or at least a close date when we're all here as a full city council.\nSpeaker 6: So I could see I could see that studying that on on on the next week and then going into the vote in January. But any item right now, as I see it, that does both will not will not work for me.\nSpeaker 6: Supernova's substitute motion would work if he were to separate the two but but it's not it's a it's it's just moving the such and about to a future date which would be what Stacey I think is recommending here.\nSpeaker 6: And I'm I can't support that. So at this point, you know, it's you know, I can I can come up with a question, but I see one councilmember hasn't spoken a lot yet. So I'm going to let her give her an opportunity to to chime in at this point as well.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And before I go to the next two speakers, I think it's important we do have a clarification because I want to make sure that everyone understands what the actual motions are and then what the processes that Mr. Mays described, because then we can maybe see some clarification on the motion on the floor.\nSpeaker 3: So and please correct me if I'm wrong here, so let me know. Okay, from the way the way I understand the current the process that needs to happen, as you've explained it right now, regardless of the study session aside, the vote on the FISA process essentially is, as you've explained, it, is a two step process.\nSpeaker 3: The first the first vote would be a request to direct management to begin engaging with JetBlue and or partners that are interested in the FISA and develop, I'm assuming, the framework for a plan to develop an FAA terminal that would then that vote on the FAA terminal, I'm assuming it would include specs and size and variety of\nSpeaker 3: different questions that could be answered. Then that would then come back to the city council for a second vote to actually move the FISA terminal forward. Is that correct or incorrect?\nSpeaker 10: Mayor. That's correct. What you essentially would be doing in the first step is actually defining a project, a real project that has, you know, the size of the building, the financial structure. And once that is defined, the project is defined.\nSpeaker 10: It would come back to the city council for a vote and approval of whatever environmental document was approved appropriate to to finalize it.\nSpeaker 3: I believe that staff's intent then is when placing it on the agenda on the 13th, is that that would be the first part of that. What you described in the second component of that would come back at a later date whenever that date was in 2017.\nSpeaker 10: The way that letters fashion. That's correct.\nSpeaker 3: So I just want to clarify, could I believe Councilwoman Mango's substitute substitute motion puts all puts all of those the study session the direction to work with JetBlue and. The actual vote. All on one day. So I just want to clarify that that that we're all that we understand what the motion is and maybe I'm incorrect there\nSpeaker 3: , but I just want to clarify with Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 10: Mayor, if I can add to that, as I understood the motion that would include, if it were passed, the staff's ability to immediately engage with tenants at the airport, which of course would include JetBlue to discuss items such as what a project would look like, what the financing would be.\nSpeaker 10: I think that's what I heard the motion to be correct.\nSpeaker 1: HILTON Yes, and I would be most interested if all of those were wrapped into one agenda item. It doesn't need to be three agenda items on the council. If it's you're the legal expert on what's possible, but I would like a member of the public to be able to come forward and speak on all three items.\nSpeaker 1: Because I think that as you and I have experience at community meetings, there's not speaking to one, just the Jacobson study or just this or just that. It's a very intertwined discussion. So I'd like it to be. One item for everyone to be able to engage on.\nSpeaker 1: And potentially, depending on what my colleagues say, I might move the study session up. Depending on if that seems like the call to the council.\nSpeaker 3: So can you clarify for me also it's part of that response because I think clearly the study session and the and those those votes can certainly be the same day, different days depending on the council's direction. But I'm also I'd like clarification for myself and maybe other members.\nSpeaker 3: Could the other two actions be on the same vote, which I think is what's currently being proposed? Is that possible?\nSpeaker 10: I'm sorry, Mia. Which other two actions?\nSpeaker 3: I think with the current substitute substitute and I could be completely interpreting this wrong, but I believe that the substitute substitute puts the. The. Giving direction to staff to work with JetBlue and then the approval of the office into one vote versus the initial separation of the votes.\nSpeaker 3: Staff at plant is well and.\nSpeaker 10: Maybe I'm not completely understand you, but as I understand the motion, what it would do, it would move the FIA study session to January 24th and it would also direct city staff to have the ability to make contact with interested tenants at the airport, including JetBlue, between now and January 24th and that on January 24th, Council would\nSpeaker 10: have a study session and the potential it wouldn't have to do it, but the potential for voting to take. The next step. And if that next step, if they've already talked with JetBlue and gotten a commitment, the next step might be to commence whatever appropriate environmental was needed.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, Councilman, do you want to make anything else? Want to add to that?\nSpeaker 1: You know, I would like to hear the rest of my colleagues comments.\nSpeaker 7: Point of information, though, because I'm really thoroughly confused now. I understood the process to be the very first step in this process would be to to send a letter to Homeland Security and then to the governor before we even get to that point.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm happy to add that in as a friendly.\nSpeaker 7: No, that's not a friendly. I'm just saying. It seems like you're putting the cart before the horse here.\nSpeaker 3: Let's get the process. Let's get that question. Let's get that one question clarified. I'm going to go through the speakers. Listen, I've got three of the council members, including Mr. Austin, at the end of the day.\nSpeaker 7: At what point does the council request that that this project even be approved by Homeland Security? So in the letter, the governors of the state of California are supposed to send a letter requesting a search.\nSpeaker 10: That's exactly right. The federal government will not move forward with approval of the office until they have a letter from the governor indicating that they the state is supportive of it. So it's kind of a dual process. One of the directions to staff would be to or could be to move forward with outreach to the state government\nSpeaker 10: . And that, you're correct, is part of the December 13th letter that is, you know, already on your agenda for December 13th, which is to direct staff to contact the governor's office to see if they are interested in allowing Long Beach to become international terminal.\nSpeaker 3: We go to the speaker's list and then we'll circle back around. Councilman Schubert on.\nSpeaker 5: Somehow I am reminded of the phrase snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory. What I'd like to add is possibly a compromise here. Let's see if we can work this out. We have the date of January 24th that has been mentioned for my original idea to move the thing after the first.\nSpeaker 5: So if we looked at the Tuesday prior of January 17th anyway, the Tuesday prior to the 24th, yea 17th. Let's get a hard date for January 17th for the study session for council then. Okay. Then let's use January 24th as the hard date for the study session, with the vote to be taken at some point after but\nSpeaker 5: not taken that night. So would that be a sub subs? I'm not sure. Or a friendly.\nSpeaker 3: They'd have to be a friendly. There's no more motions like. Do you want to just keep going down the list? Okay. Council Member Pearce.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you and thank you for the clarity on what we would actually be voting on and the clarity that. First let me let me just back up and say that it's bothered me that the conversation has said, well, because we haven't seen you at a study session, you haven't been paying attention.\nSpeaker 9: I've read the binder. I've read the study. I've paid attention. I've watched the videos. They're still out there. And we're trying to get as much information and ask as many questions as possible. And so I just want to put that out there, and I commend my colleagues for trying to ensure that there's a good, transparent process that\nSpeaker 9: everybody can engage in. And it's my commitment that in between now and January that I'll also engage in Second District residents to make sure that they're a part of the process. You know, on top of of JetBlue or airport or constituents that are trying to come out, council is also trying to plan what things they put on\nSpeaker 9: the agenda as well. And so while we continually move dates, it affects everybody else as well. And so I'm supportive of moving a date to January, even though I was very much at the beginning of this meeting concerned about moving a date to January.\nSpeaker 9: I would hope that if we move the date to the 24th, that we would be able to have a meaningful study session and a vote at that time, knowing that we still a very far away from actually getting a.\nSpeaker 9: A solid vote on having an additional. Services there. So I guess my my question is the last proposal is to do it on the 24th and then put a date in February for the vote. If that comes back up.\nSpeaker 9: And that's a friendly I really want us to try to push ourselves to just have this first vote. It's just a direction to kind of move forward with actually understanding what it would look like and all the details.\nSpeaker 9: And so I would urge us to not move past January. If my colleagues if I hear different from colleagues, then I'll be there. But I really would want to see this vote happen on the 24th with the study session, if possible.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman. Awesome.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. And once again, I want to appreciate everybody's dialog here. I know we're working to get somewhere to make some movement. I think the the ideal is to to be fair to to make sure that we don't minimize the concerns of the residents in the impacted communities, recognizing that their homes are their primary investments and their\nSpeaker 7: connection to the city is very, very important. They've asked for us to move this past the holidays. I think that's a fair ask. And it sounds like there's there's consensus here there. Right. Councilmember Mongo, your motion is like I said, it's it's my appetite is there to support it.\nSpeaker 7: I just have a problem with engaging the stakeholders and moving an agenda on a, on a, on a dual track right before we've actually had this study session. And to your point, Councilmember Pearce, I don't doubt that other council members have looked at video and read emails and read studies.\nSpeaker 7: That's what we do and that's what we were elected to do. But this is the forum for the city, right? We had the forum at the Airport Advisory Commission. It's not televised. The ABC. It's not televised. The city council was televised.\nSpeaker 7: And this this is the broad forum for for the city. And ultimately it's the call is on us. The responsibility is on this body. Right. And so I would just implore upon Ms.. Mongeau to amend your motion, drop that portion of your motion that that that that puts us in a position where we are.\nSpeaker 7: Giving giving a subtle, subtle nod to to a process that we haven't had a chance to vote on. Right. Let's let's let the process be what it is. Let's have a have due diligence, I hope. Oh, wait. I'm hoping that that we can we can do our due diligence here, have the study session.\nSpeaker 7: And if the body decides that we're going to do both, then on January 24th, it is going to be a very, very long meeting. Right. And I hope you're prepared for that. This is a meeting that will require I mean, nine city council members all will have questions.\nSpeaker 7: Some will have more than others. This could go into the wee hours of the morning. Right. And so if that's what you want to do, that's I don't I don't think that's good form for the council. But that is something that that that's a compromise I'm willing to make to to get us past the holiday season.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Next is Councilmember Ringa.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mayor. Healthy discussion. We need to continue this. But the bottom line is, again, if it's doing. As a motion that stands right now is having all these different nationalizations taking place on one city council meeting. I cannot support that.\nSpeaker 6: We're good. We're going to be here till, you know, till midnight, if not beyond that, if we if we accept that motion. So I just can't get support that. What I can support is having a study session, which is the original motion that I had and taking a vote at a different date so that we can do\nSpeaker 6: our due diligence in between the study session and when the vote takes place so that we can have all the information, including that which which. Ms.. Mongeau Councilmember Mongeau identified. But. The other cautionary note that I have on this is that there's an implied agreement to move forward with that piece.\nSpeaker 6: If we send a letter to the governor saying, we want to pass, we want you, we want your approval on it. It would I would have to see what that letter looks like first and what it's asking for in actuality, because there is no way I want to imply that the city of Long Beach is ready to\nSpeaker 6: move forward, and we need their blessing or his blessing at this point. That is not the point of sending a letter to him. The point would be there's there has been a request. There's an intent. We're studying it.\nSpeaker 6: What do you think, Governor? Can we move forward? Should we move forward? Do you have concerns? What are those issues with concerns that you have? Let us know what those are so that we can include it in a study session.\nSpeaker 6: Rather, maybe that's what should be done. First is that is is the city of Long Beach is considering being the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, whatever airport we are to be international in California. Is that workable with him? Is it workable to have three, four international airports within a 25 mile radius?\nSpeaker 6: Does that work? Because that's what's happened. That that is what exactly what happened with Alex, Ontario, John Wayne. And I think Burbank is already there or heading in that direction. I mean, there's a lot of other stuff that needs to be done beforehand.\nSpeaker 6: And that's why having a study session. Would make sense. Let's get all the questions out there. Let's study it. Let's get it. Let's get it addressed. That way when we do have the time, when it comes to a vote, we have the staff report.\nSpeaker 6: Staff will be making that report, giving us all of the information that we've asked for, and then we can take that vote. But being prepared and knowledgeable and fully vetted, as far as I'm concerned, fully vetted in regards to the feasibility of having this bias.\nSpeaker 6: So I'm sticking to my original motion at this point, although I like the possibility of of putting that out to the 24th as a study session, and then we will vote then moving it into maybe the first week or second week of February to take the vote.\nSpeaker 6: Something like this requires patience, and I know there's some impatience out there, but it requires us doing our diligence to make sure that we're going to do this and do it right. And if it takes time for us to do it right, then so be it.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, I have a long list of folks, so. Which is fine. We got it. It's an important issue. So let me just go down the all the comments. So remember, we have a subsidy subsidy on the motion council member super non.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Just as a courtesy, the audience. I want to bring him up to date on what's going on here with the dates. Jan, can't we can't meet. That's a state of the city address. So that council meeting is out of the question.\nSpeaker 5: The 17th council member, Turanga, has a Coastal Commission meeting, so in deference to his schedule, that would be out of the mix. So that takes us to the 24th, that magical date. And so what I'd like to propose now is then let's look at the 24th and either have a special meeting on the 31st.\nSpeaker 5: I'll gladly give up my community meeting, which I don't want to have that night or February 7th. Bingo.\nSpeaker 3: Well, we have a subsidy subject to keep going through the speaker's list and then come back around to Councilman Mongo, who's at the end of this list here. So Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 9: Can we call the question?\nSpeaker 3: I've only got two more, so I think maybe we'll get these last two. And unless there's any objection to that, I.\nSpeaker 4: I mean. I like the dates. I like.\nSpeaker 1: So. So I'm happy. I'm trying to accommodate everyone. I want to respect Council Member Supernova's intent not to have the study session or anything during the holidays, though I would be very supportive of the study session next week with all information coming back on the 24th so that all of that works.\nSpeaker 1: I'm also amenable to the 17th with the study session with the vote on the 24th. Councilmember Turanga has attended all of the study sessions and one of the things that I think would be pretty amazing for all of our residents is if that meeting would be potentially at Long Beach City College, closer to the residents.\nSpeaker 1: That won't have to trek themselves downtown to engage in this dialog. So I'll put that out there. I know it's not a decision that this council would be able to make at this dais, because we have no idea of the rooms available, any of the things of that.\nSpeaker 1: But I'll put it out to the city staff that if there is the will to make that happen, I believe that that would be something meaningful.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, I wanted to make sure I still had the.\nSpeaker 1: You still have the floor. But in agreeing to I'm going to have to let down either Councilmember Turanga or Councilmember Super not at this point with either the options or I'm going to have to let down my other colleagues who are not going to have so good either.\nSpeaker 9: Could I call the question on.\nSpeaker 3: Let me go let me go back to the calling of the question then. Okay.\nSpeaker 9: So calling the question on the last dates that were proposed, which was the 24th.\nSpeaker 3: You have to call the question on on ending discussion on the motion.\nSpeaker 9: I would like to call the question to end the discussion.\nSpeaker 1: Does that mean I can accept Friendly's or. No.\nSpeaker 3: It's okay. It's okay. So let's just hold on 1/2. So there's the.\nSpeaker 9: Way I see that, Lina, Councilmember Gonzalez has not spoken yet on this item. I'm just trying to help move us along. So I'm.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. I'm going to keep going down the line because we've got a couple folks. Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 8: So. Well, number one, when you call for the question is not the bit not debatable. If anybody seconds, you got to vote on the question. That's just a point of order. And then what I would say is. You know, sometimes you step back and let other council members step up and kind of work it out if they're\nSpeaker 8: more sort of engaged on that issue. My district's not in the flight path. I've paid attention to this issue since I was chief of staff for seven years. So I follow it. I'm up to speed on this issue.\nSpeaker 8: What I would say is the original item that prompted this discussion tonight was by council uranium. That actually made sense to me. It said, you know, let's have a study session before we make a decision that I'm just on a basic stamp.\nSpeaker 8: It just made sense. You know, we are if this doesn't happen on the 13th or whatever date, we're still coming to a council meeting on 13th. The my daughter's birthday is or second birthdays on Thursday. I'm still planning to be at a council meeting on the 13th to make that happen.\nSpeaker 8: And so I think we need to just put a reality check out there. The basis of this is and I understand both sides. Do we play the delay game? And I don't want to play that game if we're going to have a discussion.\nSpeaker 8: We're going to make a decision. We need to make a decision if if we want to give the public adequate time to study it. And if the council is requesting adequate time, study it. I support that as well.\nSpeaker 8: So what I'm saying is that, you know, I'm going to be in a position to have to vote down every measure until we get to council member wrangles or the motion that we're on right now, which this is very, very different.\nSpeaker 8: You just adjust the dates to where you have the study session on the 13th and you vote on the 24th. I think we keep it simple. It does not have to be all that extra stuff if that happens as a as.\nSpeaker 8: And mind you, I'm going to leave here tonight and sleep well one way or the other. So I'm okay. But I but I think that is the path to a compromise, if that's on the main on the main motion.\nSpeaker 8: It just it just makes make sense. And I hope we can just get to that.\nSpeaker 3: I'm going to go to Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I wanted to kind of sit back and listen to everything. I, too, have been up to speed with everything I've I've read as much as I could on this issue. Of course, my residents feel very differently, but I completely understand this is a citywide issue.\nSpeaker 2: I want to hear all of my colleagues and of course, the public and make sure that I'm making the best decision. And I would have to agree with Vice Mayor Richardson as well. I think that we originated this whole discussion on the premise that the 13th we would have some more information and the FAA study would provide\nSpeaker 2: us that information or the study would provide us some more information on on what direction we can we can go. And then in January, I think that's also fair to to have a month to to kind of dig into this a little bit more, even more than we already have and then possibly make a vote in January\nSpeaker 2: . I think that's a good compromise between all of these discussions that I'm hearing. And it allows us, the council members, to continue working on these on this issue and have some more information, get some more information in the next month, after the holidays.\nSpeaker 2: As Vice Mayor Richardson alluded to. We're going to still hear this this whether opposed for we still get the emails constantly. We get calls constantly about this issue. We are studying it as much as possible among all of our daily lives that we all have, whether public, elected, office, whatever.\nSpeaker 2: So I would say that if we can get to a 13th and 24th schedule, that I would be amenable to that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman. I have Councilmember Mongo. 1/2.\nSpeaker 6: Point of order, Mayor. Yes. So we are going to be voting on the motions.\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to accept a friendly.\nSpeaker 6: As as they go.\nSpeaker 3: Correct the sub sub, because.\nSpeaker 6: I would like to amend my original motion if I can. But, you know, when it comes right down to it, I will make that amendment. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: So we're going to start we're going to start with the sub sub. And I'm going to allow I think Councilman Mongo also wants to kind of clarify our motion and so that we all know what we're going to do that each step of the way.\nSpeaker 3: So if this goes further, so we know so everyone knows what the each vote is. Okay, so councilman mongo.\nSpeaker 1: So my motion will be accepting the a part of the friendly from Councilmember Turanga that we move forward with the study session on. 1213. Is that next. Next Tuesday that staff engage and get info from the state and tenants etc. and bring back all the information for a date certain of January 24th for this Council to have\nSpeaker 1: a informed packet of information and a vote. Great.\nSpeaker 7: What did. Excuse me. What does that mean?\nSpeaker 1: I don't think you have the floor, sir.\nSpeaker 3: Well, actually, hold on one sec. Well, I need 1/2. So there is. There's a motion on the floor. So Councilmember Austin is asking for clarification.\nSpeaker 7: And point of clarification. What you mean was.\nSpeaker 3: Hold on 1/2. Let me let me let me figure this out 1/2. Councilman Austin, looking for clarification on the motion. So a part of the motion or the whole motion? Councilmember.\nSpeaker 7: I understood the dates. I understood a study session on the 13th. I understood bringing it back for a vote to determine our direction. Correct. On the 21st. 24th. But I don't understand is directing staff to engage in stakeholders and with the governor's office to do something that we haven't made a decision on doing since.\nSpeaker 1: So while I appreciate your perspective, sir, I don't know. That's what any of the scope will be. It's not disingenuous. I don't know that the governor is going to say yes or no. If he's not even going to say yes, why are we having the discussion at all?\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what the scope would look like. We don't know any of those components yet. Those are the components neighbors ask me regularly so respectfully, and I'm I'm hoping that we'll pass the floor to the next person and please queue up and ask those questions of whomever at that time.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, hold on, everyone. So. Council member Supernormal.\nSpeaker 5: A couple of comments were made here, admittedly by council members who are not in airport impacted districts. The vice mayor characterized this as the DeLay game, and that is the furthest thing from my mind. I won't hold him to that particular verbiage.\nSpeaker 5: I don't think he was accusing me of playing the DeLay game, but I just like to explain the psyche of the residents who are in the airport impacted districts. Okay. They are cynical. And I hope that didn't have to bring this up tonight.\nSpeaker 5: But why didn't I know back last summer that this wasn't going to work if we brought it here during the holiday season? I'll go back to December 18th, 2007. That's when the Schroeder Hall vote was taken. That took over five years to resolve that.\nSpeaker 5: I don't know how many committee meetings we had. There were dozens. But I'll tell you one thing. At every one of those meetings the audience brought up and they tried to sneak it byas the meeting before Christmas. That's what I was trying to avoid.\nSpeaker 5: We had it here a few minutes ago and now it's gone again. So I'm going to employ, I implore my colleagues to consider moving the study session until after the first of the year. So whatever we do is not tainted by that, by the residents who live in the airport back impacted district.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Council member, Austin.\nSpeaker 7: So the intent of the item before us this evening was to have a study session, and I think it was articulated a lot down the line that we want to respect, that we want to respect the having a process.\nSpeaker 7: We want to have more information as a as a as a council before we make this decision by instructing staff to go in and start negotiating the deal points before we've actually made a decision is is wrong, right?\nSpeaker 7: We didn't do that with the Civic Center. We didn't tell staff to go in and start, you know, setting up negotiations before we made a decision to move forward with that process. Right. We don't do that with anything else.\nSpeaker 7: This is something that I'm employing upon Councilmember McGill to drop that portion of her motion. I could support everything else. Otherwise, I have to vote against this motion and encourage the rest of the council to do the same.\nSpeaker 3: Mr. Mays.\nSpeaker 10: Mayor, members of the City Council. Since we're getting close to voting on the substitute substitute, I need to make sure exactly what direction you are giving staff. And as I understand the motion, it includes a study session next week on the 13th and potential action item on the January 24th.\nSpeaker 10: And if it were to pass, it would also allow and direct city staff to engage with tenants at the airport, which would include the preliminary negotiations with, for instance, JetBlue, to determine actually what size of project that they are interested in, what financial arrangements they would be willing to make in connection with the office facility.\nSpeaker 10: And it would also allow staff to at least reach out to the governor's office and start the process of determining whether or not the governor's office would sign a letter to Customs and Border Protection indicating support of an office facility in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. There's a we have the substitute. Substitute motion on the floor. Looks like there is no other questions ready for the vote. Councilman Mango. Councilmember Austin.\nSpeaker 7: So I'm hearing two different things, right? I think Councilmember Mango's motion, what I heard was that should we do this? Staff would immediately begin those steps in terms of engagement. What I heard from the city attorney was something altogether different.\nSpeaker 7: If the city attorney's.\nSpeaker 4: Know.\nSpeaker 7: If his version of this is what we are voting on, I could I could I could support that. But was that a question of clarification or not? From the city attorney.\nSpeaker 10: I was trying to clarify what Councilman Mango's substitute substitute motion was as I understood it, which is to make sure that all of us are on the same page. As we move forward tonight, whatever the direction is, so that everybody knows exactly what they're voting on.\nSpeaker 1: So it sounded slightly different. Will you repeat it one piece at a time? Sure. This is what real making policy means to get everyone on the same ship going in the same direction.\nSpeaker 10: So one step at a time. Step one would be to set a study session for next Tuesday night, December 13.\nSpeaker 1: Everyone's clear on that one.\nSpeaker 10: Step two direct city staff to immediately begin engagement with JetBlue and any other interested.\nSpeaker 3: Until Mr. City Attorney and.\nSpeaker 10: Any other interested tenant at the airport that has an interest in the office and also engage with the government, governor's office and CBP if necessary. And the third step is to set an item on January 24th, 2017, for a potential vote by the City Council.\nSpeaker 10: That's the way I understood the motion.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. So I heard it different the second time. The first time you said a study session on December 13th. Then come back to a vote on the 14th, on the 21st, 24th of January. And then should we vote in support, we would engage with stakeholders at the airport and governor's office and move the process.\nSpeaker 7: That's what I thought I heard.\nSpeaker 10: Well, that's not what I said. I was just trying to articulate what I believe Councilwoman Mongeau said in her motion, and I think she stated it twice. And my understanding was that she wanted staff to initially engage with tenants, including JetBlue, as to things such as the size of the potential financing and all that.\nSpeaker 7: Thanks for clarifying. I think that that.\nSpeaker 1: Is putting.\nSpeaker 7: The cart before the horse.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So I think this now the I think Mr. Mays has explained what the substitute substitute motion is that is on the floor, which is has those three different components in it, which is well, you describe them. I won't describe them again.\nSpeaker 3: You just you just went through all three of them. And so please go ahead and cast your votes on the substitute substitute motion.\nSpeaker 4: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Motion carries. We are now moving on to the next item, Madam Clerk.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Mayor Garcia.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And I'm here. Can you please read the last item, which is item 27?\nSpeaker 1: Communication from Councilmember Richardson, Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilmember Pierce, Councilmember, your UNGA recommendation to request city attorney to draft an urgency ordinance to establish a moratorium on all evictions on commercial and residential units for a minimum of 30 days. Or as long as the City of Long Beach has an active emergency proclamation related to COVID 19.\nSpeaker 1: Request City Manager to suspend utility shutoffs for a minimum of 30 days. Establish an ordinance during the duration of the Declaration of emergency requiring all airport convention center and hotel employees to allow employees to wash their hands every 30 minutes and to evaluate the feasibility of implementing an economic relief package for working families and small businesses impacted\nSpeaker 1: by COVID 19.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'm going to ask if you're not speaking to, please put your phone on mute, if possible, whether that's staff or on the council side. That would be great. Thank you so much. And the way we're going to do this just for just for process is I'm going to begin with the the makers of the motion\nSpeaker 0: . So we will go Councilmember Richardson, Councilman Warringah, Councilman Pearce and consumers and Day House and then after all four of them have have have spoken on their item, then I will go ahead and go down the rest of the council in order.\nSpeaker 0: And if you have a comment, then please that would be the appropriate time to comment. And so I will go just down, down the lines as everyone has a chance to comment or ask questions. And I'll just start from District one all the way down and go and go in that direction.\nSpeaker 0: We also have public comment, which we will do once the winter's emotion on the floor. So let me begin by Councilmember having Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So within this, I'm going to make a motion place. Motion on the floor. So first I proposed, and we all empathize with the small businesses, the families, the entire Long Beach community, and also thank them for the cooperation in the interest of the health and safety of our community.\nSpeaker 3: Response by the city of Long Beach has been swift and clear and comprehensive. Thanks to our mayor, our city manager, our entire city thinks the purpose of this motion is to address the economic challenges facing our community due the impacts of the novel coronavirus.\nSpeaker 3: We, as policymakers have the authority and the social responsibility for policies that ensure that this temporary crisis become a permanent economic catastrophe for all these families and small businesses. Therefore, the exploration and adoption of a local economic relief package for the city of Long Beach is not just a reactive response to the crisis.\nSpeaker 3: It's a proactive way to place our city and our community in a in the best position possible to emerge from this crisis swiftly and in the strongest way possible. Since we submitted the proposal last Friday, a lot has changed.\nSpeaker 3: Many of the items within this proposal have already been addressed administratively, which will allow us to remove them from the proposal and focus on the remaining substantive items. I want to state that all of the ideas in this proposal are important.\nSpeaker 3: However, given the amount of work associated with this proposal, we're asking that staff prioritize the housing issues and ensure that the other issues are addressed subsequently. For the sake of time. I walk through the first part of the motion related to utility shut off and hand-washing.\nSpeaker 3: Back. I walked through the portion related to the feasibility of the economic relief package for small businesses and working families. And then lastly, I'll end with direction on the eviction moratorium, since this is going to be the most substantive item.\nSpeaker 3: First, the motion requests that the city manager take steps to suspend utility shut off in the time since we made this motion set up has already been suspended by the Long Beach Water Department Department and spoke out. Edison thanked the city city manager and Coca Edison.\nSpeaker 3: We can remove this from today's motion. Secondly, the motion requests an ordinance adding protections for workers to wash hands every 30 minutes in order to limit transmission of the virus and add an added level of comfort for workers and I Convention Center Airports and hotels.\nSpeaker 3: In speaking with our health department, our city manager, rather than institute an ordinance, there may be more appropriate ways during the emergency to address a directive, which could include an order by our health department. I'm supportive of this approach.\nSpeaker 3: I look forward to seeing what the city manager comes back with to let the motion reflect this direction. Next. Next up, there are items related to the economic package. The intent of the portion is for staff review to evaluate the feasibility of these nine items and return to council with further consideration of cost impact, next steps and\nSpeaker 3: timing for implementation. So I'm going to walk through one from today. The first one, an internal review of sick, sick leave and disability processes within city staff is already conducting the review and has made accommodations for city staff that have been very well received.\nSpeaker 3: We can take this off the list too. Identifying either funding with field view of the revenue to support our hotel industry or tourism industry has been impacted by the progression of the outbreak and speaking with the club president at length, they have thoughts on how this could support recovery efforts through local programs, this vacation program.\nSpeaker 3: Let's take this feedback into consideration. Number three, we need to explore mortgage relief program by and by. If we enact a full eviction ban, we need to ensure there's a backstop protecting small property owners and landlords from mortgage payments, and they require state or federal action.\nSpeaker 3: So we're asking staff to take appropriate steps to engage in that conversation. Number four, streamline processes of resources through partnerships with EBRD to support laid off workers. Educate. Educate folks on the resources available and explore additional education for impacted workers who are not covered by unemployment benefits.\nSpeaker 3: Next, we want to explore emergency loan assistance programs for small businesses who suffered significant loss programs as a result of this crisis. In speaking with City Manager Modica, Economic Development Department is exploring these solutions and should have to be able to speak to that.\nSpeaker 3: Should we have questions on that tonight? Number six. Potential partnerships that deeply assist people under self-quarantine as a result of the of the emergency with a priority on seniors. And in talking with our city manager and our mayor's office, we're beginning those efforts of a coordinated effort to support and check on individuals.\nSpeaker 3: We also know that a number of council districts are beginning the process of doing health and safety and welfare checks. So we like the progress here. Number seven, extend training opportunities. And we've spoken with the health department and they will explore making training available to businesses, essential businesses that remain open through the crisis.\nSpeaker 3: Number eight, relief for laid off furloughed workers in the affected industries, not limited to including but not limited to a rate of return and layoff and recall policy. The point here is that we're going to come out of this.\nSpeaker 3: Let's make sure that, as you know, hotels are going from 90% occupancy to 10% occupancy as restaurants are being hammered. We look at policies that we can put in place to ensure that this temporary crisis does not become a permanent crisis for workers and have just come back.\nSpeaker 3: Our workers have a right to return. And number nine, the worker retention policy to protect workers through potential bankruptcy and subcontracting that could occur through this crisis. The hope is that all of these will be vetted and reported back to the city council after the housing issues.\nSpeaker 3: After the housing moratorium. The eviction moratorium positions have been addressed. Finally housing the emergency. This emergency has exacerbated our current housing crisis. It impacts both tenant and housing providers. I'm glad to see the letters of support from some of our largest property owners in our city.\nSpeaker 3: I paid attention to the letters of concern from tenant folks who are already seeing reductions in their household income. And the small property owners will have to make make mortgage payments every month despite the COVID 19 crisis. The goal here is to take all of this an acceleration.\nSpeaker 3: Keep folks in their homes and protect our local economy, which includes local housing providers. The governor has put forward guidance and that should be considered as we move forward. The motion is to request the city attorney draft an urgency ordinance and minute order for consideration at the next City Council meeting to establish a moratorium on its impact\nSpeaker 3: on commercial residential units. For a minimum of 30 days or as long as the city of Long Beach, Los Angeles County or state of California have an active emergency related COVID 19 ordinance should also include a prohibition on late fees and prohibition on Section eight termination by the Housing by the Housing Authority for the Restoration of serious\nSpeaker 3: . There's further direction that the city that the city council needs to provide city planning in order to craft this motion. So the first question is, should the moratorium expire on May 31st, as suggested both by the order, by the governor's order or some sooner date or only expiration during the declaration of emergency within this motion?\nSpeaker 3: I think that we should align with the governor's order. We can revisit it later, but we should have aligned with the Governor's Order of May 31st. We understand that agency may be incentivized to keep their declaration of emergencies ongoing for a longer period.\nSpeaker 3: Then the moratorium should last for purposes of federal state funding, which may be may be after the social distancing orders have ended. So we don't want to necessarily be connected to the emergency. The emergency declaration may last longer after we've returned to work.\nSpeaker 3: Number two, should moratoriums were placed for all evictions or only evictions for nonpayment of rent. It should apply to all evictions. People can't shelter in place if they don't have shelter. Secondly, evictions are executed in the court, and I wouldn't be surprised if the courts were to be ordered to close.\nSpeaker 3: However, we know that this needs to be designed in the way that we have that we need to disincentivize fraud. Communicate clearly. This is not a holiday. We know that workers are impacted and the safety net of EDI will trigger.\nSpeaker 3: And many residents, not all but many resonate, will be eligible for unemployment benefits. So someone may be on short, maybe short on their rent. This is certainly they should be in the zone in a way to encourage that.\nSpeaker 3: They should certainly pay what they can. This is why we need to be very intentional about drawing a distinction in this in this ordinance between COVID 19 related evictions and other evictions and how those are remitted. Remedy once the emergency has ended.\nSpeaker 3: So once. So, number four, once the moratorium is lifted and unlawful detention detainers may proceed, should Senate have some grace period with which to bring crime? It'd be difficult for a ten would not have the ability to pay rent to bring rent current immediately after the expiration moratorium.\nSpeaker 3: Other jurisdictions are considering a 4 to 6 month rate for a grace period. The answer is yes. We should include a grace period only for those impacted by COVID 19. This benefit makes sense. It still requires some level of documentation of COVID related loss of income to qualify for that repayment grace period.\nSpeaker 3: These requirements can include a notice of hardship by the Senate to the landlord in advance of the due date. To ensure that property owners can be prepared, this could also include evidence of attempting to make payments or payment arrangements.\nSpeaker 3: As this is important, important to encourage people to pay rent again. All of this should be taken in consideration in the design of this of this moratorium. And thank you. And that concludes my column.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and go down for the other folks that were on this item. So the next speaker would be council members and de house.\nSpeaker 2: The. So. Hammer. Oh, okay. Um, yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Unfortunately, this public health and financial crisis that we're going through will be had the most impact on our most vulnerable communities, which are low income residents and our small businesses.\nSpeaker 2: I think that as city leaders, we have the obligation to use our resources at our disposal factors to stop the spread of this horrific virus that is going on COVID 19, but also to aid the community in whatever way we can during this extremely difficult time.\nSpeaker 2: How hard decisions have been made already, and they will continue to be made in the next days and weeks to come. And I think that we all agree we have an obligation to help the people that have been impacted by these closures and by social distancing.\nSpeaker 2: It seems to me like one of the biggest things we can do to help both individual residents and for their public health is to freeze evictions for both the duration of the crisis. And we need to make sure that whatever happens in the next few weeks, people are able to remain in their homes with access to water\nSpeaker 2: and power in order to keep themselves in quarantine. For the extension of of the time that the COVID 19 is gone. It's really hard because we have no direct, you know, inclination of when this may be over. But one of the things that we can see is that, you know, we really need to help out our community\nSpeaker 2: right now. And I'm very, you know, very thankful for the state and federal government for actually taking bold steps and to helping us locally. Public health experts have told us that our single greatest weapon into stopping the spread of coronavirus is ensuring that everyone possible can stay home with me, that this item makes this possible.\nSpeaker 2: It also asks that our city staff together plan so that we as local governments reimburse them whatever we are able to invest in our business, businesses and during and after the time of this incredibly stressful time. Unfortunately, we don't have the resources to do this alone, and we all need to rely on our county, state and federal\nSpeaker 2: partners to continue helping us. But we still have an obligation to do what we can. And this is what I represent and that first step in helping our community out.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you, Councilmember. I'm going to move on to. I'm going to go to Councilmember Pearce. And if you're not speaking. Please, you're my.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you. Thank and really thank you from Member Richardson for coordinating this item. I know that is I think the four of us all had pieces of this item that we all kind of felt near and dear to our heart.\nSpeaker 2: And we did an excellent job of really coordinating into one piece. And I think you've answered and took most of the talking points that I was going to make reference to the things that I want to tease out that are most important for me, not only for our constituents, which include renters, landlords, small business owners.\nSpeaker 2: The really here is that this is about really making sure that we all can breathe a little easier and be that the pressure valve has been released a little bit, that if you, a landlord have an opportunity to have some grace periods with your mortgage, pay a different percentage.\nSpeaker 2: So that makes it easier for you to accept that a tenant might not be able to make those payments. And so I know that staff has a lot of work ahead of them on this item, but I think that it is the right item.\nSpeaker 2: Again, not just because this is about tenant issues, but this is about the health of our local economy. We know what the hotel industry, 98% I'm sorry, 89% of the workers in our hotel industry live right here in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: And so if we are closing down hotels, which I will tell you just today, we know that our highways are closing. We know that the court systems are closing, our restaurants close of are closing. So these are our tenants.\nSpeaker 2: These are our residents that our neighbors that we really need to make sure we're providing a safe community for them. So I support the item that's in front of us, the questions about notification. I think that when a tenant or a homeowner or anybody that that needs to pay rent or mortgage, when that triggers, when they lose\nSpeaker 2: that job, they reduce their hours that that notification should be made as soon as possible to their landlords, of course, the person they owe that to. And they should begin working on a plan, as Councilmember Richardson said, whether that's paying a percentage and a payment plan.\nSpeaker 2: For example, my rent is $2,000 a month, which is more than I bring home from council. So being able to talk to my landlord and say this is the reduced amount that I can pay with my current income, this is what I would be able to pay on top of it in the next six months.\nSpeaker 2: So if I divided that up over six months, that's $333 a month additional that I would need to pay when this moratorium is lifted. The really making sure that our tenants are small business owners are not only getting that relief, but that they're sitting down with somebody and working through a payment plan.\nSpeaker 2: I think that they should do that with the person that they owe the debt to. But I'd also like to see economic development and the team work on financial literacy for our community members. I think it's going to be the biggest need that we see not only in trying to get a temporary job for short term jobs\nSpeaker 2: , getting new jobs, but really sitting down and saying, what are your finances and how can we help? Because we know that financial literacy is not something that is our strongest suit, I think, in our school system. And often when an emergency like this happens, a lot of us are just kind of paralyzed and trying to figure out\nSpeaker 2: what we have to do. The next part I would mention in the questions that were asked is in reference to timing. I agree that we should tackle the housing situation first because they are the most detailed and difficult to try to unwrap, but also give our community members the biggest opportunity to breathe.\nSpeaker 2: The same thing that council members and they have said is this is not about tenant issues, this is about a health issue. I believe that this affects all evictions because we know that nobody should be moving right now when we're asking people to stay in their homes and to go out for only necessary items.\nSpeaker 2: It's really important that we're not sending a wrong message that says, well, it's okay if you have to move locations and good luck finding another place, particularly in this situation when it comes to the worker, if you've got it listed on here, I know that our hospitality industry was the first industry that was really hit hard, that\nSpeaker 2: we expected to see a lot of closures. You know, hopefully it doesn't get to a place of bankruptcies, but we know that that industry is going to go through the biggest change. So depending on where we end up, we can't see the future.\nSpeaker 2: This is going to be a big impact for all of us, all of the employees in the city of Long Beach. So I would ask that staff, when thinking about the worker pieces around worker retention, recall workers, that that is not just for hospitality, but that is a program we are looking at holistically to give some guidelines\nSpeaker 2: and in case. Might or might not remember. We already have some of these policies on the books when it comes to the airport and the convention center that were passed in 2013. But but in the time of having new contractors come in when their contracts get renegotiated, that workers get the opportunity to stay on the job.\nSpeaker 2: I forget if it was 30 days or 60 days to prove themselves when a new employer comes in. There are some model language and other policies that we can kind of look at already. I don't think that this work will be the most difficult.\nSpeaker 2: I think it will be the easiest. When we talk about hand-washing, I want to clarify that, you know, it's difficult to mandate that an employee washes their hands every 30 minutes. But I would like to say that we want to encourage that there are best practices for health and safety and that workers are not punished for them\nSpeaker 2: . We have seen industries punish workers whenever they have tried to go to the bathroom, wash their hands, do things on a normal day of work. In an epidemic like this, we can't have that happening. And so working with staff to really have some best practices.\nSpeaker 2: Again, maybe it's not an ordinance, but an order from our health department on how we have health and safety, making sure that those training opportunities our health department has been doing is also available to anybody that does. Food service is really important.\nSpeaker 2: And the last thing I'll say is for vulnerable populations or seniors, those that have a compromised immune system, I know that the mayor and I had a conversation. My community members have been talking nonstop about what system do we have in place?\nSpeaker 2: And it feels like there's a lot of micro communities creating systems to give out food, to say, you know what, I was one of those people that got too many rolls of toilet paper and I want to give them back.\nSpeaker 2: How do I do that? It'd be much easier to have a centralized system within the city, whether that's the mayor's office or city manager's office, and that we each have a staff role in that. So I know Randy has been kind of the point person in our community working with our neighborhood associations and know that it's an\nSpeaker 2: item in the in this agenda. I just wanted to say that we're here to help as much as possible and as much as we can have a coordinated effort. I know that we've all had a lot on our plates lately, but that is something that I think could rise above some of the worker recall items.\nSpeaker 2: So it's more housing, small business loans or housing vulnerable populations, small business loans. And some of the worker our return issues would be the the order that I'd like to to hopefully get us to work on. I know there will be questions.\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry if I talk too long, but it's an important issue and I really hope that we can count on our council and our city to do what what's best in this public health crisis. So I'm sure we will.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you guys so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next up is Councilor Marie Ringo. Contrary, Ringa. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and go down just the rest of the council. And so when I can if you have a comment.\nSpeaker 3: A given, you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Sorry. Go ahead, Councilman Marengo.\nSpeaker 3: That was uncanny. They were saying, I want to thank my cast members, colleagues for bringing this up and all the great comments you made right now. One of the things that I was going to focus on was the fact that the eviction is a very important part of this whole process, and they know that that's being addressed\nSpeaker 3: . However, we have another community that we haven't really discussed here that's the homeless community, and the opportunities were not an opportunity that they have to go through this process. If Cosmo Richardson can go in there, so work with me for a bit on this.\nSpeaker 3: Maybe it's possible, maybe a third or not. But I'm looking at the possibility because hotels and motels and other other establishments are being closed, are closing. Is there an opportunity for city staff to look at ways that we could get vouchers or other types of payment that we can make available for those that are being evicted or\nSpeaker 3: thrown out or whatever that already are in the streets, who can take advantage of maybe have the the the hospitality industry and getting some some revenue out of this opportunity for to get people established somewhere and they'd have to be out in the street.\nSpeaker 3: So yes, to bring that out there as a possibility, because obviously, like I said, the the environmental justice community would include homeless in this. And I think we should look at ways that we can. There meet this challenge.\nSpeaker 3: This is a challenge. Now, we may look at this as an opportunity for them as well. But other than that, we haven't heard, at least not yet during the discussion as to what the effective date would be for these reviews and come back in terms of the initiation date or no.\nSpeaker 3: I would certainly suppose to support the date of when we went into this emergency, and that would be through the declaration of a state of emergency, which would take us to as it was the last Wednesday or Thursday.\nSpeaker 3: And that's all we could have at this point.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. Now I'm going to go ahead and move on to the council. I'm going to call that the council member. And if you have a comment, please, that's when you comment, I'll just go down the line.\nSpeaker 0: If you don't have a comment, you can just say no comment and we'll just move on to the next to the next member. So first one would be Councilmember Price.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Okay. So a couple of questions. I know Rich Anthony is probably either on the call or there in person, but he did send a very thoughtful email that asks for us to provide some clarification in a few areas.\nSpeaker 2: So if it's okay, I'd like to just start and talk to Mr. Anthony regarding the motion that's on the floor. I understand the motion. As currently on the floor is proposed to sunset on May 31st. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember Price and councilmember, right. Oh, I'm sorry. This is. This is rich. Anthony, I just wanted to confirm I'm on the phone, and that's the way I'm interpreting the motion.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then my understanding and I'm going to address this with some recommendations or amendments in a minute, but currently the motion that's on the floor applies to all evictions. Correct?\nSpeaker 3: Correct.\nSpeaker 2: Not just those for nonpayment, but it's people that are being evicted due to non-covid-19 related reasons such as nuisance activity, illegal activity, domestic violence, things that are enumerated in the code.\nSpeaker 3: Correct.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. As the motion is currently presented on the floor. Is there any provision for a grace period for the tenant to pay rent after the moratorium expires on May 31st?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. I thought Councilmember Richardson did a great job on explaining that. I feel like I have the information I need in order to bring back an ordinance.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you what could I trouble you to just repeat it to me? Because there was just a lot and I was trying to take notes during Councilman Richardson's movement of the item, but I missed that entirely. So could you share with me what your belief on that is?\nSpeaker 3: Certainly. I don't mean to step on Councilmember Richardson's toes. Councilmember Richardson, do you want to re-explain or do you want me to do it? I'm happy to do it. I mean, you take a crack at it, and at the end, I can I can probably clarify the first part about how it applies and then anything that's missing\nSpeaker 3: . Okay. I'll I'll take a shot at the way I understand the motion on the floor, which is tenants who are not or are not being evicted because of the COVID 19 related reasons. Those tenants who take advantage of the unlawful detainer ban, who can show that it's a COVID 19 related reason, will have 4 to 6 months\nSpeaker 3: after the ban is lifted to come current on rent. They will have to continue to make their regular rent payments and they will have 4 to 6 months to make up the entirety of the rent payments that they missed.\nSpeaker 3: Tenants who have taken advantage of the unlawful detainer ban or moratorium, who do not have a COVID 19 related reason for why they couldn't pay rent or were otherwise subject to eviction who have no COVID 19 reason. Those tenants would not have a grace period within which to repay the rent they didn't pay during the moratorium.\nSpeaker 3: They would have to come current immediately upon expiration of the moratorium.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. That that explains that. Thank you very much. Okay. So I. I would like to. First of all, I want to thank my council colleagues who brought this item forward. I think it's a really important conversation.\nSpeaker 2: I do want to give a huge commendation to our economic development team, because several of the items that are in here they have been working on in terms of business stimulus. In fact, Lisa West from my office worked with economic development and we put out an email to all of our business owners regarding all the loans that\nSpeaker 2: are out there available, you know, any sort of stimulus packages that are available. And but I mean, a lot has changed and it's changing on a daily basis. But I want to thank our economic development team for allowing us to at least be able to get that information out when we had it, which was after the president's\nSpeaker 2: speech about small business support. And as a small business owner, I'm very, very grateful that our economic development team has been working on that, and I would hope that they continue to do so. And this item kind of formalizes what they've been doing, and I think that's fantastic.\nSpeaker 2: But any ideas that come out as a result of COVID 19 economic discussions obviously should be included. We shouldn't limit ourselves to the four corners of the agenda item tonight because I think there may be some opportunities that come up that we may not be aware of even yet.\nSpeaker 2: So in regards to the residential moratorium item. When we come back, Mr. Anthony, to go on this.\nSpeaker 3: So I think I can get something done in time to have the council consider this at a special meeting on Tuesday. Would it be March 24th, next Tuesday? I don't want to make that firm, but I understand the urgent nature of this.\nSpeaker 3: So the latest it would be would be maybe a special meeting on Thursday, the 26th at the latest. But I'm confident I can get something done by the 24th.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. And I ask that because, Councilor Richardson, one thing I didn't see in here and I could have missed that. It's been a really crazy week, so I could have missed it if it was. And the document was any sort of request for staff to research property tax deferment for property owners.\nSpeaker 2: As we all know, that's coming due on April and April, and it would be good to see if we can do anything about property tax deferment, which isn't it? Is that okay with you? Would you accept the amendment to ask for our report?\nSpeaker 2: Just to report back on that when we come back.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Absolutely.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Thank you. Um, I the the one aspect that I'm really struggling with, with the motion that's on the floor tonight, and I understand the reasoning for it. Obviously, we want to do everything that we can to try to help, you know, workers and the city residents in the city.\nSpeaker 2: Again, you know, I'm a small business owner. I'm having to have very difficult conversations with my employees. My husband and I write the check for their payroll every two weeks. I'm also a manager managing over 80 people who are all government employees but very, very concerned about the economic impact that this is having on them.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm very aware of the very difficult conversations that we're all having and need to have. But the one area where I really struggle with on this item is evictions that are happening for non payment of rent due to COVID 19.\nSpeaker 2: I do not think we should be limiting property owners rights to evict tenants under the law who violate a term of their rental agreement by virtue of committing one of the enumerated offenses that's listed in our California code.\nSpeaker 2: Whether it's a nuisance property, whether it's criminal activity, whether it's dog fighting, you know, whatever of the enumerated sections that are in there, if they involve something other than nonpayment of rent for COVID 19, I don't believe the moratorium should apply to that.\nSpeaker 2: And so, Councilman Richardson, are you open to an amendment that would limit the moratorium to nonpayment of rent due to COVID 19?\nSpeaker 3: If I if I can respond to it. Mr. Mayor. Great. What I'd like to talk through a little bit is even if someone has committed an offense and they, you know, we want to get the landlord want to get rid of this person and it's not related to COVID 19 under the order.\nSpeaker 3: It's not a convenient time for people to move. So for the sake of so we're not saying you shouldn't be evicted. What we're saying is don't serve them today. You know, if if you know, certainly call the police, maybe there's some provision that is tough for Rich to look at and say in extreme cases, there's, you know\nSpeaker 3: , there's something that could happen. But the idea here isn't necessarily protect bad guy. The idea is to limit movement. You can't shelter in place if you don't have shelter. So. So what? So what the recommendation was, what I added was that I want to have a separate process for non cogat related entities, a separate process altogether.\nSpeaker 3: I look at it as almost two moratorium. There's one for Kogut related. There are benefits associated with that, like a grace period for catch up. And then there are instances where it's not all it related. Let's say someone doesn't have a cold experience and they're just not paying the rent and gaming the system.\nSpeaker 3: But they have to know that there's a penalty and there will be evicted and that this eviction should happen as soon as the period is over. And so and so I think there should be if you're open to giving giving the city attorney a little bit of a way to say we want to apply the simple protection\nSpeaker 3: of not moving through the end of this. That's the point. However, deal with it separately and there could be open to the idea that he may have to deal with all, you know, finance cases you're talking about. But I think that we say in general, the message should be, you know, not necessarily just related to COVID.\nSpeaker 3: It should be COVID is treated this way, we understand in hardship, but period, people should not be moving in this in this moment. This is a public health emergency. And so we should stay in place. And so I'd love to hear I'd love to actually hear from Mr. Anthony.\nSpeaker 3: If there is a way to divine this in the way that addresses some of or maybe makes, you know, Cancer Council member praise or others who feel the same way, they can feel a little bit more comfortable that there could be a way to address these issues.\nSpeaker 3: Well.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. If possible, I'd like to kind of finish my comments, but I still would love to hear from Anthony, but I kind of want to finish my thoughts on it. Okay. So my concern is this, and I get that we want to limit people's movement.\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. But private property owners are not. They're not part of our health care system. They're not a public entity. They're not a public agency. And if anything, property owners, they have a duty to protect the peace and enjoyment of the property of all of their residents.\nSpeaker 2: We talked about this when we talked about Lilo tenant Willow and just cause eviction. And one of the things we talked about is for something for an offense to rise to the level that it qualifies as a violation of one of those very limited, enumerated offenses.\nSpeaker 2: It's pretty serious. And what it means is, by the time it comes to the attention of the property owner, another neighbor has complained police may have already been called. It's not I mean, you made a great point. A lot of courts are closed.\nSpeaker 2: So certainly we can't be offering them the court option as a way to provide peace and enjoyment, because even if the police come out, if courts are closed, we're not going to get that matter adjudicated or a restraining order issued if courts are closed for a period of time.\nSpeaker 2: So it really leaves the property owner in a very difficult situation because they have received complaints from someone who lives on the property, whether it's domestic violence, criminal activity, nuisance behavior, whatever of the enumerations that exist, they now feel that they have to take action to protect the other resident.\nSpeaker 2: And so I don't believe that we as a public entity can force them to become a public entity that's providing a service. So there may be two paths to address COVID related nonpayment and nonpayment related eviction. But I feel like the moratorium, if it were in place, would only offer a diversion of those two categories of cases\nSpeaker 2: on the back end, not on the front end, because the moratorium would be in place and would apply to all evictions regardless of category. Now, Mr. Anthony, I could be wrong, but my understanding of how the moratorium. Once it's over effect payment or nonpayment.\nSpeaker 2: And the period up is really on the tail end, not on the front end because of the moratorium which applied to all evictions, then it would certainly apply to all evictions equally. At the outset, Mr. Richardson's right. Absolutely.\nSpeaker 2: It would keep people in their homes. But I don't believe that we can or should mandate that on property owners. So, Mr. Anthony, is there an alternative that prevents people property, that allows property owners to get rid of nuisance?\nSpeaker 2: Nuisance or one of the enumerated violators from being a victim.\nSpeaker 3: As much as I'd like to tell you, I have an idea that would be acceptable to the position espoused by Councilmember Richardson and the one espoused by EU Council member Pryce. I can't think of one. I mean, I think I think it's clear each one of your respective positions.\nSpeaker 3: And there is no way to thread the needle here. It either applies to all evictions, including the non monetary evictions. And that comes with the, with the kinds that you just espoused or we go with all evictions and yes, it would apply on the front end, as you described it.\nSpeaker 3: But I think everyone understands one another's positions, and I don't know of a way to rectify those two.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. So I'm concerned about on the front end with the issue and you know what happens? Who can be evicted? That's really I love that we have a grace period option for COVID 19. I think that's fantastic.\nSpeaker 2: I support that wholeheartedly. I'm just that's the one area where I think Councilman Richard Richardson and I may disagree and we may or may not get to a place of agreement. But but I love that we're having these discussions.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's healthy and good. The other question that I have is, does the current motion on the floor allow for or require any sort of advance notice by the tenant to the landlord that they may not be able to make rent?\nSpeaker 3: Again, Councilmember Richardson, correct me if I'm wrong. I think I heard and I think the motion said that the notice there does need to be advance notice. And I don't know how far in advance. That's a question I was going to ask for a clarification.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm glad you brought this up, Councilmember Price. But it wasn't it's not they can't default in the payment of rent and then several days, months or weeks later, give a reason why and give documentation why. I mean, they could, but that's not what I heard Councilmember Richardson say it needs to occur on or before the date\nSpeaker 3: that rent was due. Absolutely. So that's that's my comments with respect that. Yeah. So just to clarify, yes, there should be a notice of hardship in advance of the rent due date. Those are the words that are used.\nSpeaker 3: So if you perceive if you're going to claim this hardship and you're going to, you know, default on your rent, there needs to be some notice. And that factors into whether or not you're eligible for whatever benefit happens after the fact.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay, I got it. And I think that's great. I mean, I think something like 7 to 10 days would be ideal, but that's not for me. I defer to my colleagues on what you think advance notice looks like and how detailed we want to get on that.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So with that, I mean, I think I'm in agreement with pretty much everything. Oh, the one thing I wanted to ask for the stimulus package is, Councilman Richardson, would you be open to the city also exploring the feasibility of a moratorium on meters, enforcing meters through the end of March, just so we have a better.\nSpeaker 3: Parking.\nSpeaker 2: Meter on parking meters.\nSpeaker 3: Parking meters. And then the second part where staff explorers can comes back. Absolutely. Let's have totally explore that and give us all the impacts on it. Well, actually.\nSpeaker 2: That would be great. Sure. Okay. So I think that a good. So for the mean, for the motion that's on the floor right now, I think there's I'm in agreement with everything Councilman Richardson has proposed except for the moratorium based on nonpayment of rent as a result of impact of COVID 19 versus a moratorium against all evictions\nSpeaker 2: . And I think for me, that's an important one. And so if that amendment is not being accepted, then I think that the option that I have at this point is to make a substitute motion that would include all the provisions that Councilman Richardson has indicated regarding the residential moratorium item, but that the moratorium would be limited to\nSpeaker 2: nonpayment occurring as a result of the fact. The impact of COVID 19.\nSpeaker 3: Set an.\nSpeaker 2: Eviction.\nSpeaker 3: Sure.\nSpeaker 2: So.\nSpeaker 3: So I think I find some I mean in listening to you and and and resampling, I think as long as there's a councilmember getting around. So yeah. Councilmember Richardson, we before we discuss that substitute, there needs to be a second.\nSpeaker 3: Is anyone willing to say that?\nSpeaker 0: Rich. Rich. I got it. Thank you. And so I just want to make sure that before we move forward. So Councilwoman Pryce, I think, is making a substitute motion. I just want to clarify.\nSpeaker 3: Well, not yet.\nSpeaker 0: Well, hold on. I got it. Hold on a second. Thank you. So, Councilman Pryce, I think you're about to make a substitute motion, and either you're going to make the substitute motion and we'll call for a second, or I think Councilman Richardson sounds like he's maybe willing to to change the motion.\nSpeaker 0: So Councilman Price has the floor. So would you like to continue and make that motion or a return, or do you want to hear from Councilman Richardson?\nSpeaker 2: I'd love to hear from Councilman Richardson.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Councilman Richardson.\nSpeaker 3: So. So I completely understand what it is that you're expressing the issue, the issue here. But I think we may be able to find a middle ground and long term emotion and willing to make an amendment in the case that there is so that that line is going to be hard to draw.\nSpeaker 3: First of all, between cogat related and corporate related, it is only going to try his best to figure out how to document Kogut related. But Corbett related. The day yesterday meant something different than it did today, because the governor's order just today, just yesterday, expanded COBRA related from people who are sick or have been laid off to\nSpeaker 3: people who haven't been able to commute to work or whatever due to due to the stay in place order. And it will likely change again between now and when it's over. And so if so, maybe there's a way to say, you know, expand this, you know, COBRA related incidents, non-covid related.\nSpeaker 3: There should be if there's a way and I'm looking for the rich here, there's always a case. The nine calls that will. They're the way to sort of sort of, I don't know, appeal it or appeal it or say something to the fact of it is delayed some period of time, but not on the 31st.\nSpeaker 3: I don't know. Is there any room on that space? Because that's going to determine whether I accept the friendly or if we or if we if we just go with alternative motion. I think the goal here, again, this isn't the typical and it rates like this is, you know, there are victims on all sides here.\nSpeaker 3: And that's why we want to we want to sort of make sense, but also don't want to create a situation where we set a goal line that moves tomorrow and or we create a giant loophole for people to say, well, my interpretation as my interpretation is that you're not you're not impacted by COVID.\nSpeaker 3: And some of that I am impacted by COVID. And if that's a moving target. So for Mr. Anthony, just. So two questions. One, do you understand that that point about a moving target? And two, is there a way to add?\nSpeaker 3: Well, I'm not sure there is. It may not be. Is there a way to add on that second portion potentially? You know, something that there's an alternative process and with interest on the front end so that, for example, if any correlated or if a police department is releasing, then that is that is treated differently than if police\nSpeaker 3: department is not related and it is not what it was. I was able to figure this out. Well, I think we could if you wanted to get more granular and specific about which nonpayment causes of action for eviction you wanted to you wanted to prohibit in which you didn't.\nSpeaker 3: You know, we could we're going to get pretty specific if we go down that road, but we could if you wanted to make it so that nonpayment, evictions, that moratorium expired sooner than May 31st, like April 30th or any other date you might choose.\nSpeaker 3: We could, but I don't think the last thing you had mentioned was maybe some sort of an appeal to before somebody that he this is a particularly egregious act that a tenant committed. They shouldn't be able to avail themselves of the unlawful detainer prohibition.\nSpeaker 3: I don't see how that works. So hopefully that guidance, I don't know how helpful it is. I think maybe the discussion will do that. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to move forward with with the eviction on COVID related, but I want you to separately so we can move forth out of the next meeting.\nSpeaker 3: I want you to grapple with this issue or no, call it related, because I know that the goal line is going to move. I know that this is going to create a giant gap in this system. I also understand that we need to I think it makes more sense to say, hey, you know, the benefits, like the\nSpeaker 3: incentive based program, the benefits of having a payment plan and documenting that you've you've attempted to make payments during the emergency. All those things are connected to the payment, the incentive to keep people paying rent or paying whatever they can get as opposed to you can get in the system.\nSpeaker 3: A You cannot, right? So if, if I'm okay with saying for what we know we can get now, which is called the relief that those people need relief and we need to do a little bit more work, a little bit more work on the other side.\nSpeaker 3: So I would say come back with what considerations you would need to know in order to expand this to others in a separate system or a second secondary moratorium. And is that something you could do, Reg? Because if so, I'm going to I'm going to make that motion.\nSpeaker 0: Well, there's already your yard. You already have the motions. And let me let me hold on a second. Yeah, we actually have. So Councilman Pryce still has the floor. So just to be clear, guys, thank you. So Councilman Price actually still has the floor.\nSpeaker 0: She's she was getting clarification and allowed and I was okay with Councilman Richardson getting clarification. And so just so where we are at, it sounds like, is that Councilmember Richardson is open to taking Councilman Price's suggestion and just moving forward on the COVID 19 piece on the on the eviction piece, and that that would be the motion\nSpeaker 0: . But I want to go back to Councilwoman Price to make sure that that's how she heard it or if she has additional comments or suggestions. Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 2: I so I'm a little bit concerned because the family was that it just applies to nonpayment related to COVID. But it sounds like there's a second piece that we're going to come back to explore. And so, you know, I'm just trying to keep this as clean as possible and saying that I agree with the provisions, but I\nSpeaker 2: absolutely have no interest in supporting a motion tonight that ties the hands of property owners for non-covid related evictions that are legally enumerated in the California code. So I'd like to make a substitute at this point because I'm a little bit concerned about the second part piece.\nSpeaker 2: And it to me, it's it's unfortunately a little bit messier. So what I would like to do is make a proposal that all of the original motion is included in this, but that the eviction moratorium is only adds to COVID related nonpayment, that the tenant provides the housing provider with notice of an advance of rent being due\nSpeaker 2: . That is my son.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That is the most. Is. Is there. Hold on. Is there a second to the motion? Also there's a second by Councilwoman Mongo. Somebody call a point of order.\nSpeaker 3: Rex, which has been called the point of pride, councilman. Okay. So what you just described is the motion that I just made. And what I asked for is more information. You indicated that you're uncomfortable with this piece. And what I'm saying is I want to learn more about that piece.\nSpeaker 3: But the actual ocean that's on the floor is the same as yours. You can't make a substitute motion. That's the exact same of the main motion. So this is actually under the point of order. Council Member You are adding that second piece, so technically it's not the same motion.\nSpeaker 3: So the point of order is not well taken.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, so we're going to move forward. So we're moving forward.\nSpeaker 3: But. Well, okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I think the city attorney has as opined on the point on the point of order. So we have we have a substitute motion on the floor currently. Now we're moving on next. Councilman Price, I know you have the floor.\nSpeaker 0: Did you have any other additional comments?\nSpeaker 2: No, thank.\nSpeaker 0: You. Okay. Next up is Customer Supernova. Did you have any comments?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, I do. Thank you. So at this point, I'm addressing the substitute motion and that it is exclusively to provide for evictions due to nonpayment of rent. And that being said, I would like to address some of the comments we got from housing providers, and these are my words, not theirs.\nSpeaker 3: But the question was to me my interpretation. Why is the buck stopping with the housing providers? Why are they on the hook or for the nonpayment? So I would like to ask the question of the city attorney and could the city step up here and use some type of funding?\nSpeaker 3: And I would recommend a housing trust fund or some other funding source to make the residents payments for them that are COVID related. I think that is an amendment to the substitute motion, but I'm willing to make a substantive council on price is not able to accept that.\nSpeaker 2: Sorry about that. Is that something staff have? Is that even a feasible option? I don't even know if it's a feasible point.\nSpeaker 3: I mean.\nSpeaker 2: I'll be honest, I'm a little bit uncomfortable adding that in because I hadn't thought about it. So I may not accept it, but I don't know if council or staff can talk about it.\nSpeaker 3: So this is optional. Go ahead. Well, no. If the city attorney would like to weigh in that great. I mentioned the housing trust fund as a possible funding mechanism for this. Um, considering it's an emergency situation, if there are other funding sources, maybe the amendment could be to to examine other funding sources to help both the tenant\nSpeaker 3: and the landlords in this case. So this is Rich Anthony, deputy city attorney. The short answer is, I don't know for certain, but it's something we'd have to look into. But I doubt it. I don't think we could use housing trust fund money for that purpose.\nSpeaker 3: But I can't give you a definitive answer. But Linda Tatum is here with me and she's nodding your head in general agreement with me. We can look into it and report back, but we don't we don't think it will work.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And if we looked at could the amendment be to look at other funding sources that we might have to work the same way if the housing trust fund is out of the question? We can still look into that.\nSpeaker 3: I think that question is completely you know.\nSpeaker 2: Darrell, I appreciate where you're coming from. I think that's a really good point. I'm I'm not going to accept that amendment right now. I'm just trying to keep this as simple as possible so I'm not going to I just want my sub to be what the sub is.\nSpeaker 2: I had hoped that it would just be very clean amendment, but it's just the sub now, so I'm not going to accept that at this time.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: So I appreciate Darrell's comments and I appreciate the Suzy Price Economic Relief Package amendment. What I'll do is I'll make the subscribe with a request from city staff to explore what options are available for alternative gaps. So let me give you an example.\nSpeaker 2: In talking with a housing provider, there are agencies that should the. Tenant not be able to provide them. All they have to do is receive the notice of nonpayment from their landlord and take it to a third party and.\nSpeaker 2: Bet that other party will pay it and make them current on rent. And so I feel like it's really important that we explore the agencies and nonprofits that already support this. So if we could also get on some subsidy, what is in council and prices item plus a report back on.\nSpeaker 2: Other funds. Available to tenants and housing providers that can fill the gap, because I think that that's critical in the whole process to know what other. Resources are available because at the end of the day, what we don't want is.\nSpeaker 2: Someone who's to support is that someone who has already passed due to months and is choosing to stay in a unit that should that won't be able to come. Complete eviction process. Make a housing unit available potentially to someone who is currently homeless.\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it's not like you're taking these.\nSpeaker 3: Out of.\nSpeaker 2: Out of circulation. You're hopefully getting them into other homes. And you're also not seeing that someone who is currently behind on rent and about to get evicted wouldn't potentially be better in a situation with their family or other other.\nSpeaker 3: Support.\nSpeaker 2: Where they could get back up on their feet and be able to move through the crisis with support. So I think those are the resources that are critical. So that would be my substance.\nSpeaker 0: If there's a substitute. Substitute, is there a second on that?\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Supernova second it.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. There is a second on that. Then the manga motion is the motion that's on the floor. Councilmember Austin.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So thank you very much. I want to thank you all for this conversation. I think it's very timely. And first of all, I would just say that I want to help the welfare of our city should be the priority at this point.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that has been the focus, particularly over the last week. A lot has changed just in the last few days. And I want to commend I haven't had an opportunity to say it publicly. I commend our city staff, particularly our health department, our public administrators, our staff and the leadership of the mayor during this very\nSpeaker 3: tough period. As I said, and I want to talk.\nSpeaker 0: Hey, everyone, can you please mute your phone? Thank you. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember voters, we should remind. We should be making every effort to try to bring calm and relief to families, single parents, seniors and everyone in our community. And yes, a workforce that definitely is being impacted. I'm going to lower my support for the ideal of an eviction moratorium this evening related to COVID 19.\nSpeaker 3: I think that's a very important distinction that should be made because we want to discourage anyone from taking advantage of the system or the situation all around. Right. Housing providers, but also renters. And I would just hope that this moratorium didn't have to come before us.\nSpeaker 3: You know, I'm seeing some amazing things and people are coming together in amazing ways of the community understanding and supporting one another, supporting their neighbors and fellow human being during this very, very tough time. Everybody is impacted. And no matter what your economic status is or was a week ago, it's different today.\nSpeaker 3: And particularly those who are without work, that is that is a very, very tough time thing for any family to face. And so this is compassionate. This is responsible. This is. These are extraordinary times. And so extraordinary times make for extraordinary public policy.\nSpeaker 3: And so I think we should be doing something to bring relief, bring calm, manage stress in our community. But but also understand that we should not be creating a situation where individuals should be or we're encouraging individuals to take advantage of the situation.\nSpeaker 3: I'm hoping that this crisis will bring out the best in everybody. And like I said, we're all in in impacted by this all the way around. I do think that there's there's some merit to looking at the feasibility of looking at using a housing trust fund or other sources.\nSpeaker 3: And also monitoring with relief is available to us and will be available to us from the federal and state governments. We can't go this and we can't realistically do this alone. Right. We're going to have to have support from from the feds and the states state government.\nSpeaker 3: And I think there's obviously some some no decision has been made there. And so hopefully over the next week or so that will come out, become more clear for our staff to be able to bring that what is available and what is available for our residents in the city.\nSpeaker 3: I want to speak to for the most part, everything else is pretty much self-explanatory. I'm certainly supportive of looking at the feasibility of of of most of the points that that have been raised here. But I'm 39 when it comes to looking at the suitability of a road of relief for laid off and furloughed workers and mine\nSpeaker 3: worker retention in specific industries called out here. I would just remind you all that, you know, truck drivers for truck drivers are impacted now. Dockworkers are being impacted. Gyms are closing. So gym and fitness trainers and employees who work in the fitness industry, retail workers, artists, workers, musicians, restaurant workers, servers, bartenders, cooks, folks in the entertainment industry\nSpeaker 3: . These is the airline employees. So if there is I know there's a subset on the floor, I would add a friendly amendment to both eight and nine to include workers in all of these impacted industries, to see what type of relief can be available for them as well.\nSpeaker 3: So these are all working families and they make up the fabric of each.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman mango tree in my comment. Do you accept that as part of your substitute substitute?\nSpeaker 3: First of all, Madam Chair of the Fifth District Council member, would that be a subset? Would therefore Amendment B be? Acceptable? Would you be open to amendment?\nSpeaker 0: Councilman.\nSpeaker 3: Hello?\nSpeaker 2: Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, we can. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Hello? Okay. I think they're excellent amendments. I excitedly think that those friendlies I think that they're very poignant to the the crisis. And I also appreciate how each of you started your comments. I often get lost in my notes and I just do want to take a step back.\nSpeaker 2: And all of these amendments and so much of this motion and the other components of that were handled by city staff in advance. And I just think we just need to once again thank our city manager, our interim city manager, the city management team that worked tirelessly over the weekend, the economic development team, because they really, really\nSpeaker 2: have stepped up and they wholeheartedly accept the funding.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you to them. Those have been accepted by Councilman Austin. I know that vice mayor and Vice Mayor Andrews had the call had dropped from his connection. For some reason, it's back on now. So we we skipped over his comments.\nSpeaker 0: And so we're going to go back to Vice Mayor Andrews.\nSpeaker 3: Mr. Mayor and the mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Vice Mayor Andrews.\nSpeaker 3: Mr. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 2: I. As a matter.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We're going we're going to keep going then.\nSpeaker 2: So, Heidi.\nSpeaker 0: It's Vice Mayor Andrews there.\nSpeaker 2: But.\nSpeaker 0: Guys. I got it. Is Vice Mayor Andrews there? Okay. We're going to we'll get back to Vice Mayor Andrews if you want if you want to still speak.\nSpeaker 2: Next up is the only one who can hear Vice Mayor Andrews.\nSpeaker 0: He's not on the line. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: We were talking. Oh.\nSpeaker 0: We're going to keep, you know. No.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Can you hear me now? Now we can hear you. Thank you. Fine. Go ahead by saying that.\nSpeaker 3: Sorry, I get cut off here. Okay, fine. You know, and I just like to listen to every one about, you know, college, to be honest with them, which I think is at the situation where we're in. It's something we've never, ever dealt with.\nSpeaker 3: It's going to take, I think, patience and soul searching to do the right thing, to put compassion over properly. You know, I'm supporting their side. Long as we ensure that we can deal in the application and not application to our landlords of our properties.\nSpeaker 3: Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: We can hear you. Keep going.\nSpeaker 2: Hang on. You've got that.\nSpeaker 3: Wrong. Can you hear me now?\nSpeaker 0: Hey, we need everyone. We need everyone to put up. Put it on mute, please. Except for Vice Mayor Andrews. Thank you. Thanks, Mary Andrews. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, fine. You believe me now, sir?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: You mean. Can you.\nSpeaker 0: On? I'm here. Yes, we can continue.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, fine. Thank you very much. There's going to be so much confusion in here. This is a different, you know, situation we're in.\nSpeaker 2: But.\nSpeaker 3: You know, I want to thank everyone for bringing this into the digest today because I think it's very important. And I think we all realize, you know, the situation that we're in. And I think this situation, you know, we're and it's something that we have never, ever had to deal with.\nSpeaker 3: And it's going to take patience and soul searching to do the right thing, to put passion over property. Yeah, I'm supporting this idea. As long as we ensure and we can build verification and notification. Right. I support working families.\nSpeaker 3: I know that we are in the crisis, yet small mom and pop landlords need to be notified if they're not going to be received. But they can be an income. Also an act of language in the ordinance that needs to clear it is not a rent pass.\nSpeaker 3: This is assistance to those who need the additional time given in the circumstances. And we need to work together to establish the relief package that is going to help tenant landlords, business owners and camouflage and more that we're going to get through this by working together.\nSpeaker 3: As far as the length and the hand-washing cost for employees. I would like to throw this to the city manager team to do some additional research into how we could be incorporated in vessels that work.\nSpeaker 2: In the high.\nSpeaker 3: Concentrate area. And with these comments, I'd like to leave it at that. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Vice managers. Before I move on to Councilwoman. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I set the friendly note. The friendly.\nSpeaker 0: I was. Yeah, I was. I was just going to call the quotation and verification.\nSpeaker 2: Well, what.\nSpeaker 0: Is. Hold on 1/2, everyone. I got it. Hold on.\nSpeaker 2: The mayor on?\nSpeaker 0: Yep. I'm here. 1/2. Thank you. Before we move on to great clarification on the motion as well is I need everyone to please mute their phone.\nSpeaker 2: Waiting for the mayor.\nSpeaker 0: I need everyone to mute their phone, please. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: And are there.\nSpeaker 0: The mayor is here. Huh? Okay. The mayor is here. Everyone just mute their phone for a second. Thank you. So what we're going to do now is Vice Mayor Andrews has also made a friendly amendment or a friendly suggestion to Councilwoman Mongo and her subsub.\nSpeaker 0: And so, Councilman Mongo, would you be I think I heard her say that she would accept Vice Mayor Andrews's suggestion for staff to look into. Is that right? Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 3: Record. You verify the basement, you take over. Yes. Hello?\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah, we got.\nSpeaker 3: It in there.\nSpeaker 0: We're just waiting, guys. Broke. Put your phones on mute. We're just waiting for.\nSpeaker 2: You to speak again at the very beginning. So I was waiting for him to get on to just continue the queue up a vote. I didn't know if somebody was before me, but.\nSpeaker 0: I can. You can hear me? I have a question. Can you guys hear me or. No?\nSpeaker 3: This is Charlie. I'll walk down to Kumasi Franklin, the mayor of if we can. Just wait one minute, though.\nSpeaker 0: The mayor is. The mayor is.\nSpeaker 2: Here.\nSpeaker 0: In the chamber. Huh? We're going to. We're going to just hold for 1/2. Can you. I'm here, aren't I? Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Go ahead. The mayor's here.\nSpeaker 0: Can you guys hear me or no?\nSpeaker 2: Amy Goodman.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So. So please. That we're going to continue, if you can hear me. I am continuing the meeting. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. All right.\nSpeaker 0: Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: Finished speaking.\nSpeaker 0: Guys, I got the meeting, so I need everyone else to put their phone on mute, please. Thank you very much. Vice Mayor Andrews had a friendly amendment to Councilwoman Mango, which I believe she has accepted. Councilwoman Mongo, you've accepted that?\nSpeaker 0: Okay, perfect. Now we're good. Now we're on the substitute. Substitute motion before we move on to the next person cued up, which is Councilmember Pierce. We are going to go, if you don't mind, Councilwoman Pierce, we have two members of the public.\nSpeaker 0: Can we go to members of the public first and then we'll come back to you? Or do you want to keep going? Councilwoman Pierce.\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to get clarity because I thought that councilmember or vice mayor. And his speaking sounded like he supported the original motion, not the substitute substitute motion. So can we just be clear before we.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 2: Public comment and then I'll see my comments for the end?\nSpeaker 0: Sure we can. We can if you get clarification on the substance substitute. But it was my impression that Vice Mayor Andrews was supporting the motion that's on the floor, which was Councilman Bongo's motion. So I will get we'll get clarity from that.\nSpeaker 3: That's accepted.\nSpeaker 0: So that that's so that is the motion that's on the floor is councilman mangas motion. So, Councilmember Pierce, when I'm going to go is the public comment. We only have two speakers on public comment or we have three or we can or you can we can go back to users.\nSpeaker 0: Cueing everyone up. It's up to you.\nSpeaker 2: And that's a public figure.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. So I have I have three members of the public. Please. Will come up one at a time. Maria Lopez. Maria Lopez here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There she is. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So my name is Maria. I'm a proud one resident since I migrated at the age of three. And now I'm the director of Community Organizing for Housing Long Beach, and I organize with a large tenants union. And obviously I am here in support of item number 27, the coronavirus economic relief package for Long Beach families and\nSpeaker 1: small businesses. I want to thank first all city staff, Rex Richardson's office and also all community members who have gotten this done today. It's apparent that there is a lot of impact, impact depending on literally how much income you can make.\nSpeaker 1: So obviously, folks who are in poverty are mostly devastated with these effects. Kids are back at home and they need to eat. And not to mention they need a space to learn and grow, which most of them do not have because they live in overcrowded housing.\nSpeaker 1: Their parents are residents are losing hours of work and some are even losing their jobs. Not only are vulnerable families right now in this time of need saying, hey, there's a lot of stuff going, but they're also receiving eviction notices.\nSpeaker 1: Just how Westar did in the ninth and in the second District just this past Friday, serving 60 day notices. And also what we are seeing is even rent increase notices. So there is no worry on the landlord side to make sure that tenants can stay in self-isolation or quarantine with their families because they are being impacted in\nSpeaker 1: different various ways. Also, I want to echo some of what already council has said. Rex Richardson states that we would want to encourage tenants to pay what they can. That is true. I believe. I believe that is true also as they are paying what they can.\nSpeaker 1: They should also not be having to be their rents being increased. And so with that same note, Councilwoman Pierce states that we should not have anyone moving during these times. And with that same token, I want we don't want to see rents go up as jobs are being lost and prices for bare necessities like water and toilet\nSpeaker 1: paper, as you all have seen, I'm sure, have gone up skyrocketing. And so we would also like to see. I want to hear more of this advance notice as still as it's still not hashed out how our tenants going to be able to communicate with their landlord when we can't even find a landlord for four months on\nSpeaker 1: a building they just bought on Daisy Avenue right here on Fourth and Daisy. So I want to know that also, would landlords be the one telling tenants, Hey, because obviously we have more connection with landlords via city council.\nSpeaker 1: So would you all be communicating with landlords? You minutes know about those things. And also, if you think you're about to vocalize, you know, let's continue to move towards right of council, local enforcement mechanisms, etc.. Thank you so much time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next was is. It can be.\nSpeaker 4: So I can say sisters for resident. I think it's clear that we're heading into. So I'm going to raise it up. I think it's clear that we're heading into a recession. Um. Unfortunately, our federal government. And the people on top have failed us.\nSpeaker 4: And now we're dealing with an epidemic. A pandemic that. Many people in this generation, you know, has never even had any impact interaction with. That being said I think it's. Beyond a shadow of a doubt evil to even contemplate putting people up in this moment where, you know, hundreds, if not thousands across the city are panicking and\nSpeaker 4: . You know, spending most of their time off in grocery stores trying to pack for what they unfeasible moments. You know, my mother works for L.A. County in the county is, you know, has an emergency plan that says this is going to last to June, if not July.\nSpeaker 4: So I can understand why any landlords would think it's even feasible of a thought to put people up during this moment. As it stands, the federal government right now is dealing with a potential economic package that will essentially be a bailout.\nSpeaker 4: To a lot of landlords and and businesses across the country, whether that means a payroll tax cut or there's a variety of ways of doing that. But I don't think it's appropriate to have this evictions going on in the midst of something so serious.\nSpeaker 4: I want to thank, first of all, the council, Rex Richardson for bringing this up as well as a councilman during a I believe he seconded it. I think there should be some level of enforcement on companies like Westar and perhaps Kenny who are actively giving out eviction notices to people in the middle of of of this crisis\nSpeaker 4: . And, you know, they should be ashamed of themselves. And the companies in the organizations that represent them should be ashamed themselves as well, because it's very clear that the federal government is working right now on a economic package to bail you out.\nSpeaker 4: So if that's the case and if top down, there's already funds going to be coming up down the way, you shouldn't be so greedy. In any case, I'm eager to see what the city manager and city attorney have in mind for any economic relief.\nSpeaker 4: I think we on the local level, micro, micro wise and immediately try to figure out some kind of economic stimulus. That way, the more people we have spending money, the less money that the city is losing. Because as it stands, you know, going to have major budget issues later on down the year.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mike Murchison. Mayor and council members. Good evening. I raced down.\nSpeaker 4: Here because there was audio.\nSpeaker 0: Problems. I apologize to address the entire agenda item, not just the sub sub. I'll say this to.\nSpeaker 4: Start off with, I'm in support on behalf of rental property owners SPEIER And the Apartment Association and Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 5: Mungo's.\nSpeaker 0: Subsub. I do want to bring up the fact over the last two and a half, three years, it's been very clear at.\nSpeaker 4: Public meetings that tenants have had a difficult time.\nSpeaker 0: Paying rent with rents the way they've been. I think we've heard that here on public testimony. So I caution you to basically say that we're going to defer the payment of rents versus looking at the housing trust fund or other government subsidies to offset this.\nSpeaker 0: There has to be an understanding what are tenants going to do if they have to pay back three or four months rent by a certain date, if they're having a tough time because.\nSpeaker 4: They're going month to month to.\nSpeaker 0: Begin with. So please take that into consideration. When staff is.\nSpeaker 4: Looking for whether it's the housing trust fund or whether.\nSpeaker 0: It's some other entity that can help offset these payments that are not coming forward. Secondly, you know.\nSpeaker 4: Rental property owners.\nSpeaker 0: Have the same struggle in a different way than tenants do in the fact that if the tenants are not paying the rent, then landlords have a tough time paying their mortgage. They're going to go into default. So we have to acknowledge that this is not just a tenant situation.\nSpeaker 0: This is a landlord and tenant situation. And everybody in Long Beach. I just want to make sure that the landlords are at least addressed in our future discussions. In mentioning the second part of Rex's excuse me, Councilmember Richardson's agenda item on the hotels.\nSpeaker 0: Many of you may have seen that the Hyatt closed Marriott nationally is cutting back 10,000 employees there. These hotels are big, big suppliers of your bed tax in your city. So anything mayor and council that you can do to take a look at bed tax rebates for not only the hotel but the hotel employees so that they\nSpeaker 0: share in getting something back, I think is extremely important. I think on behalf of the tenants excuse me, on behalf of the rental property owners and the hotels, having the mayor and the council send a letter to the Treasurer, to the tax collector for the April payment, it's a step in the right direction because we're all suffering\nSpeaker 0: here. So it's important that we communicated to those agencies that are expecting.\nSpeaker 4: Collection of payments here come April.\nSpeaker 0: I appreciate the comments tonight. I think it's been a very good dialog, but I am a little bit uncertain as to how renters are going to pay back landlords in the next several months if they're happy, if they're going month to month as it stands right now.\nSpeaker 0: So please look at alternative situations. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes public comment. I have Councilwoman Pierce, then Councilwoman and D.A., then Councilwoman Price, and then Councilmember Richardson all queued up to speak. I'm going to speak after when once everyone else has spoken so that after the next four have gone up.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Price. I'm sorry, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, everybody, for your comment. Oh, it's. I only put it down every. So I was optimistic coming into this meeting that we were all on the same page with the level of crisis that we are in.\nSpeaker 2: So I naively assumed that we would find a middle ground that would allow for our entire city to feel safe. And so I didn't talk a lot about what's happened in my district in the last two months, but just.\nSpeaker 2: Several days ago, one of the buildings in my district. They all receive. An eviction notice. By. 13 people made in a building on Ocean Boulevard received an eviction notice five days before we called this meeting. And so those are 13 families that are going to be out on the streets if we allow this vote to happen just\nSpeaker 2: like it is and. It's hard for me on one hand to say we are going on lockdown, that our kids can't go to school, but our kids can't have playdates that we have to cover up if we're going to go into a grocery store.\nSpeaker 2: But this is a moment of crisis and that it's okay to tell somebody, sorry, you got to go. So the items and areas where I felt like made sense. Councilmember Price you obviously you hit on, you know when PD when people feel unsafe.\nSpeaker 2: I lived in an apartment where there was a violent person next door and they had to get evicted. And so I hope, as we're all cued up again, that maybe we can continue to have a conversation about what this next piece looks like because.\nSpeaker 2: So COVID 19, you know, it could mean that, yes, somebody lost their job, that they lost their hours. It could also mean that now they have to take care of an elder that used to live in a multi-family senior facility, that they decided to move into their home and now they're caring for somebody else and now they\nSpeaker 2: have additional resources. I know that I spent $400 at the grocery store, but I didn't have budgeted. What does that mean for a family of four? For Jose, who's the bedroom owner? People are going to go in and get their haircuts.\nSpeaker 2: And she has four kids. And so thinking about every single impact of what COVID means in our community when we're putting our community on lockdown, to say that you can only not evict somebody if they haven't if their hours got cut or if it becomes a paycheck issue.\nSpeaker 2: It's really hard for me. And so I would really like to hear maybe it's from from Stacy, maybe it's from Susie if there are other items. Because I know even though you're talking about looking at the housing trust fund, this council and the council before us has never funded the housing trust fund.\nSpeaker 2: There's no money in there. I will also say that my neighbor received an eviction notice before the COVID 19 process happened. She got a three day notice. She called. Unfortunately, I don't like to call out our city departments when they when we dropped the ball.\nSpeaker 2: But she called our our health department, our housing department and said, I need rental assistance. And they told her that she needed to go on Section eight waitlist. It took me calling our city manager's department to get her to talk to the right person to get connected with the right resources.\nSpeaker 2: People out there do not know that there is money for them, and even when they think they know, when they call it, they talk to the wrong person on the phone. Then they're left out high and dry. And so putting people in that situation in the middle of what is a crisis, like I said, when we're on\nSpeaker 2: lockdown, when I mean, I'm getting yelled out on Facebook for walking down my neighborhood block and we're going to ask people to uproot their families in the middle of this. I think that if it's not a safety issue, if PD hasn't been called in, it's not for an emergency safety issue where residents don't feel safe.\nSpeaker 2: But we have to figure something else out. People qualify for unemployment. We're not saying that they're not going to pay their rent at all. And this is to the next issue. So as I mentioned in my beginning comments and I didn't make friendlies.\nSpeaker 2: And so, you know, I'm typically not the person to make friendlies, but I guess I would clarify that my comments in the beginning were that we should have staff also give direction. When a tenant can pay something that they should, whether that's a certain percentage of what their income is.\nSpeaker 2: So whether that's their disability or their unemployment or whatever their money is that they are getting, that they should continue to pay some type of rent as a percentage. So I guess that's a question for the city attorney.\nSpeaker 2: Is that something that's possible or does it need to be just an eviction moratorium? Or is there another layer where we can really give direction to say that, you know, landlords should be able to accept a percentage of income?\nSpeaker 3: We certainly can put in the ordinance to the extent that tenant can pay, they have to pay. And I'm certain landlords would be happy to accept whatever can be paid.\nSpeaker 2: So I got on my little answers that never hit. Listen to everybody. Um. So I would say, you know, that is the one area that I like to hear from my colleagues as we go through this. Um, I guess a more specific suddenly would be a friendly for.\nSpeaker 2: Evictions only for nuisances. You know that it's not for any other reason, but it's a new sense of action. And that way we can try to make sure that. But if it has to do with anything that has to do with unable to pay their rent, that those people aren't being put out on the street.\nSpeaker 2: Because what happens when people can't pay their rent, whether it was a director, they work for the hotel industry or they took on more responsibilities or whatever it is. We know Financial Times fluctuate, but that they're not going to be able to go find that 2000 to $7000 it takes to get into another place.\nSpeaker 2: And so just being able to limit it. So I'm asking for a friendly. To have this for evictions, only for nuisances and COVID 19. Councilmember Mungo.\nSpeaker 3: Butler.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: I think that it's important to identify some of the funds and answer some of Jennings questions. But interval health. Interval health has been funds that they set aside to help these kinds of situations. And I'm open to hearing a little bit more about what my other colleagues have to say.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm not I'm not done with my comments if you don't want to accept the family. I think it's really important for us to understand how difficult it is. For tennis on any given day. And this is not saying that landlords are bad.\nSpeaker 2: This is not saying that we expect landlords to take the brunt of this thing, that we are in this together as a community in crisis. And we're asking for. For us to act that way, you know, and to really understand the impact of this and not, you know, try to.\nSpeaker 2: Try to make this a black and white issue about about renters versus tenants versus landlords, which is why this item also includes all the other items. It includes, um, you know, going back and talking about mortgages and moratoriums on that and all of those other pieces.\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, I think it's great that we've gotten to this point, but it is really heartbreaking when I know so many families in my district are going to be out on the street for no reason of their own, not because they couldn't pay, not because they were a nuisance tenants, but that we're allowing people to get\nSpeaker 2: kicked out in the middle of this crisis when. While trying to figure out how to feed our family, period.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you, Counsel County.\nSpeaker 2: But I wanted to. Yeah?\nSpeaker 0: Do you? I'm sorry. Did you have more? Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I.\nSpeaker 0: Was. Okay, go ahead. Continue.\nSpeaker 2: Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Continue.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. On the worker piece. I know that we talked about it earlier. And and I does say the same thing that I said in the beginning. So I'd like to just clarify. The hope is that if. The points that we put in here about the hotel industry, that it would be for city wide, not for one\nSpeaker 2: specific industry, but that there would be a process in place where employers could follow an easy process when it's time to hire people back and to make sure the people are being trained on health and safety standards. So trying to claim this as a win today.\nSpeaker 2: But it's. It's hard. Thank you, guys.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. Councilman Zendaya's.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. Let me see if I understand this correctly, because I believe that Councilmember Price was saying that kind of like, you know, excluding those who are nuisances to the property so, you know, to where they're renting.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that that's very important as as, you know, we really need to find some kind of solution. We are in a crisis and we are, you know, needing to be quarantined at this moment. There are so many, so many possibilities of spreading COVID 19 and just by being outside of your home.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that that's what I'm seeing that keeps being lost in translation, if that's even something that could cover what was going on right now, I think that right now we're all very worried. But one of the things that we really need to focus on is to stop the spread of COVID 19.\nSpeaker 2: And the only way we're going to be able to do that is for us to remain at home and be in, you know, be outside as least as possible. And that's what we really have to focus on when we're thinking about this.\nSpeaker 2: One of the things that I I think is that one is it's going to be hard for everyone across the board, including renters who lose their jobs, who can't pay or who now find themselves having to pay more on food and and supplies to be able to maintain themselves at home.\nSpeaker 2: We're also, you know, small business owners are being impacted so, so bad as they were struggling before. Now they're just I don't even know, you know, what's going on right now with our small businesses, because it's just so heartbreaking to see that our small property owners who want to be the good landlords, who want to be, you\nSpeaker 2: know, as open as possible and be as helpful to the community as possible, know what happens when they're in turn, have to pay their mortgages. So we really have to find some kind of solution that will help everyone.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that what is being said tonight, you know, this economic relief package that we're presenting, this item I think is very important to moving forward and for the safety of our city and the survival of our city.\nSpeaker 2: Because as you seeing, you know. Yes, right now, we may be ahead of the curve, but that's what it's going to take. And we have to continue being a part of the process. And these are really so many pieces of it in Long Beach and just silence.\nSpeaker 2: We see so many people that are vulnerable in our communities, especially with our seniors and our, you know, residents with disabilities, including myself, that are so much more vulnerable to this type of virus, is affecting, affecting and ultimately taking lives.\nSpeaker 2: And that's where what is here is that lives are at stake here. And our community is really in need of our leadership and is really in need of all of us helping them feel some kind of calmness and some kind of, you know, protection and some kind of, you know, they just want to feel that we are\nSpeaker 2: doing everything possible that we can to to make sure that our city and our residents in this city are protected. So I think that, you know, we need to really look at this and we really need to make sure that, you know, we are doing the best that we can to make sure that we ensure the safety\nSpeaker 2: and the stop the spread of this COVID 19. So I think that there's a way to do this. And I'm getting, you know, a little confused on the steps and the families and stuff. But I mean, you know, I'm trying to keep up.\nSpeaker 2: So right now, if if you if somebody said sorry, tell me, please tell me what's on the floor right now.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, Councilwoman. Actually, we're about to do that, I think. Yeah, we're right. Actually, that's what we're queued up to do next before Councilwoman Pryce speaks. So, did you have anything else, Councilmember?\nSpeaker 2: I just want to say that this is that we're in a crisis and we have to we have to be active and be proactive in this crisis mode.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. We have two other speakers, which is Councilwoman Pryce and then council member Richardson. And then I'm going to speak. Let me go ahead and first, if I can have the city attorney clarify the motion, the sub sub motion.\nSpeaker 0: I think I it's it's mostly the the original motion with some with some changes as it relates to the eviction piece of focusing on those impacted by COVID 19. There were also some friendly amendments that were that were added as far as getting information about different types of workforce, workforce groups that are out there and and labor\nSpeaker 0: groups that are out there. But did you want to maybe go if even if Rich wants to maybe kind of Republican for subsub.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. I will try to do that, Mayor. Thank you. So I think in order to repeat everything that's on the floor, I do need to start at the beginning, which is the original motion was moratorium expires May 31st of this year.\nSpeaker 3: It's there's a 4 to 6 month grace period for people that avail themselves of the moratorium. The notice needs to be the notice by the tenant to the landlord of its inability to pay needs to be delivered to the landlord prior to the underpayment of rent.\nSpeaker 3: And there was also a friendly to that motion to ask staff to look into the possibility that the county tax assessor could somehow waive or allow for a reduction or defer the property tax payment. Susie's second city council member, Price's sub, adopted all of that, but said that the only the only tenants that would be eligible for\nSpeaker 3: the prohibition on unlawful detainer would be tenants that were suffering a COVID related inability to pay the sub cerb was the same what made by Councilmember Mongo the same as council member operations, but also directed staff to explore the possibility or availability of other funds that could help pay rent on tenant's behalf to make up the difference\nSpeaker 3: . And there was also a friendly add to that, I believe, by council member Austin that you I think described quite well, Mayor, having to do with workforce and some other labor related issues, which I don't I can't recall all the details, but we'll certainly look at the tape.\nSpeaker 3: That's what I believe is on the floor.\nSpeaker 0: And I think.\nSpeaker 3: Hopefully I clarified things rather than saying.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, and I think a request also by Vice Mayor Andrews to also look at workforce specifically as it relates to folks who are washing doing car washing work and other types of work. I think I got that piece as well.\nSpeaker 0: And so I think that is.\nSpeaker 2: May I, Mayor Vice Mayor Andrews also asked for better clarification on notification to the landlords and verification of COVID 19 connectivity. And then one other point of clarification is that we wouldn't ask the assessor for relief. We'd ask the Treasurer, tax collector.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So that's. That's the motion. The mayor. Hold on 1/2. That's a motion that's on the floor. And when you're speaking, can you actually clarify who's speaking that? I'm not exactly sure who that was. So who's the next?\nSpeaker 0: Who else? Okay, Councilman. Mongo. Thank you. I'm going to I have two other folks on the speakers list now, unless there's a clarification on the motion.\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to clarify. I'd like to clarify. I just want to repeat for the record that I did make a friendly or ask for a friendly on the nuisance eviction, but that was not accepted yet.\nSpeaker 0: That's correct.\nSpeaker 2: I just. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And now we're moving on to Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So a couple of things. Councilwoman Munroe, in your subset, I just want to make sure and this is why I was hesitant to accept of Superyachts. I just want to confirm the moratorium is not conditioned on the request to look at additional funding sources.\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\nSpeaker 3: Not.\nSpeaker 2: So we can come back on the 24th and vote on this. And it wouldn't we wouldn't have to have staff report on other funding options to do so. No, I would imagine that that would go on simultaneously, especially since many of these other funding sources from the federal and state governments are rapidly evolving and may not be\nSpeaker 2: available by then. But maybe.\nSpeaker 3: It's.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks. Well, in light of that, I'm going to support the subscribe. Let me just say, Councilwoman Pierce, you know, I think perhaps there's a little bit of confusion. All of the hypothetical situations that you provided would be covered under the sub sub.\nSpeaker 2: And the amendment that that I had originally made that was not accepted. COVID 19 related impacts include every single impact that results in a loss of financial resources such that they can't pay rent, so they are having to provide childcare having reduced hours in your job.\nSpeaker 2: All of those would result in lower ability to pay your rent or decrease the ability to pay your rent. So it's very broad in terms of what the impacts are. The impacts need only be as a result of COVID 19.\nSpeaker 2: But as we've all talked about, the financial impact of COVID 19 are huge. They're affecting people not just because of layoffs or not just because of reduced hours, but because people have to procure additional childcare now. So it would cover all of that, all of the hypothetical situations you described would be covered under this.\nSpeaker 2: You also said one thing council woman Peirce Let me just I know council member Mongeau made a comment and I think she made it a just about you know, so and so economic package you council member Peirce council and then they have Councilman Richardson and Councilman Urunga should be applauded for bringing this item forward and having this\nSpeaker 2: discussion. I am happy to consider this your package. It's to me, ownership of it can be with you. I think I started my comments by talking about what a great item it is and really highlighted every single aspect of it.\nSpeaker 2: But there was one area where I disagreed and I think when we're talking about compromise. Accepting amendments and being open to amendments, even the ones that could impact, you know, that could that could cause us to be divided.\nSpeaker 2: It's really it takes a lot of leadership to think about. If I don't accept this amendment, what could happen? There's always a risk. And I've seen it happen time and time again on this council. We're a simple amendment that's very important.\nSpeaker 2: Someone is, for whatever reason, things change. So I would like to see that, you know. Councilmember Pearce, you said something like, I would like to consider this a win. Well, you know, I don't I don't like to use the terms win or loss in anything that we do.\nSpeaker 2: Even in my day job, you know, we.\nSpeaker 0: Actually can't ever pierce.\nSpeaker 2: Me about how we're handling ourselves.\nSpeaker 0: Carter Pierce. Actually, Councilman Price has the floor, so let's let's. She's she has up. She has the floor. Continue, Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 2: So I'll be. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So, Mr. Mayor, so my recommendation would be that it's not a win or a loss, but as a council body, the four councilmembers who brought this item should feel very proud. And I will repeat as often as I can, and you'll allow me to, that we're having this discussion because of\nSpeaker 2: you. So thank you. We don't agree on every aspect of it, but thank you for allowing us to have this discussion. We are going to put forth an item tonight that is consistent with what the governor has allowed us to do and actually more detailed than what the governor has allowed us to do.\nSpeaker 2: We are taking action tonight to try to help our businesses. We're taking action tonight to try to help renters. We are taking action to look at these issues. To me, if you want to couch it in the terms of when or what, I would consider it a win.\nSpeaker 2: But I wouldn't couch it in those terms. I'd couch it as progress. And it's progress that we are making together as a body, even if we don't agree 100% on every aspect of it. And so I would just urge my colleagues to think about it that way.\nSpeaker 2: It's a difficult conversation. I'm grateful that we've had it and I'm thankful. Councilman Richardson, Councilman Yarrawonga, Councilwoman Pearce and Councilwoman Van de Hockey for allowing us to have this discussion and for boldly bringing this item forward. Thank you for doing so.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. I have Councilmember Richardson and then I'm going to close. Councilman Richardson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to go back to the beginning. So the purpose of this was really to acknowledge the economic crisis that we're in. And we do have a lot of authority, as I said, to to make sure that we can kind of control this crisis and make sure we present opportunities to land the\nSpeaker 3: right way. We recovered the right way, right a lot. We're taking some big steps here where we're thinking about how, you know, if this cascade of layoffs would have happened, hadn't been happened. When we come out, how do we prepare the workforce for workers who get their jobs back and keep temporary from crisis, from turning into permanent\nSpeaker 3: catastrophe for families? So a lot of good things that we're doing here. The differences between the motion that I laid out and and where we've landed. They're nuanced. They're small. They are important. I think that the issues raised about, you know, whether someone's a nuisance, should they be extended that rate?\nSpeaker 3: I, I agree. I agree. I just want to flesh it out a bit more. But there are areas where they're not there wouldn't be applied in this. In this instance, for example, if a building, an entire building, you know, dozens of families receive a 60 day notice due to substantial remodel.\nSpeaker 3: Then it would be very difficult because some of those people will will likely have been affected by COVID 19 and some of them will not. How do you evict the whole building? When you go for a substantial remodel in this moment, that's a lot of movement and it's counterintuitive to our social distancing strategy.\nSpeaker 3: And on that point, that's why I think we need to continue to do more work. But I'm happy to support what's in front of us today. Work day. It's not complete. It means more work. We acknowledge this at the beginning that the motion we laid out on Friday has changed between Friday and Tuesday.\nSpeaker 3: Just given the changing nature of what this is, I am anticipating that at some point we may need to come back and readdress this given, you know, I anticipate that the slowdown, the economic slowdown and our social distancing strategy will continue to ramp up in California.\nSpeaker 3: And we may be looking at an entire situation where we're looking at no more. It's going to be apparent that that COVID impacts, everybody will be able to isolate themselves. I want to read that one point that I didn't hear in the city from the city attorney.\nSpeaker 3: That was in my original motion. I wanted to extend this. The paint leaked. I've called this out in my in my comments, but both the extension to section eight as well as the payment, I want to make sure that that was Mr. Anthony that he did catch that.\nSpeaker 3: No, you're absolutely right. That was an oversight on my part, not to restate that just because it was never the subject of discussion, but that is in the motion in your motion in the sub and in the subsub.\nSpeaker 3: Right. Thank you. So I'm going to I'm going to close by saying I encourage the city council. The unanimous that I am voting for this motion is the right thing to do for all of these families. It's in alignment with the order that the governor has submitted.\nSpeaker 3: It is not perfect. We are going to have to continue to meet and work these things out. But tonight, we're giving a lot of cards, the people who are who are struggling and have a lot of anxiety. And that should be the message that comes out tonight.\nSpeaker 3: We're giving a valuable heads up to our landlords. We know that they are going to take a hit as well. And we're going to stay vigilant and find solutions to help resolve this whole issue. I want to thank all my colleagues and I support the motion.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'm going to close up for for the evening some make some final some final comments. I want to just want to just go ahead and say, actually, I have one more council member that still wants to speak again.\nSpeaker 0: That's Council Pierce. And then I'm going to make my comments.\nSpeaker 3: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to say that I make comments about it being a when we're about our community. And I do believe that this is a win and I am proud of this item. And I do think that we still have more work to do.\nSpeaker 2: And I'd like to continue to treat everybody. With dignity and respect. And I know that I get emotional, particularly when it's about roof overhead during difficult times. Obviously, we're all feeling a lot of stress, but I want to apply this council for the steps are taking.\nSpeaker 2: I do believe that we need to do more and I believe it will come back to do more. So I hope that I have you guys with dignity and respect as we handle some of the most difficult votes that we will ever handle on our term in council.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So let me just close out. First of all, I strongly support the motion that's in front of us today. And I think that it is a really strong package. I want to go back and just say one is of course, I want to thank the four original makers of this motion.\nSpeaker 0: I know they put a lot of work into this, especially Councilman Richardson and his team. I also want to thank all the other council members that added to this motion. And I think the entire council tonight obviously is interested and cares about economic relief and economic development.\nSpeaker 0: And I think you heard that from all the comments and all of the substitutes that were made tonight. So the whole council is engaged and cares about this issue. And I think that's very clear. It's also very clear, and I don't want it to get lost tonight about what's actually happening with the council, what's in front of\nSpeaker 0: us. And the motion that's in front of us does provide relief for tenants that are facing eviction during this crisis. It does provide opportunities for us to look at giving economic and financial relief as it comes to bill payment through our utilities.\nSpeaker 0: It does provide opportunity for us to look at financial packages for small businesses, for business, for for businesses that really need our support. And it looks at broadly asking staff to come back with recommendations as it relates to supporting workers, workers that are in the current workforce and those that unfortunately are facing layoffs.\nSpeaker 0: I want to uplift all of this tonight. This is important. But I also want to just add that this is a step in the right direction. But I think as we are all aware, we are at the at the beginning of what is going to be a long and very difficult economic recovery.\nSpeaker 0: And the city's actions tonight, I think, are absolutely an important part of that. But the broader question is how in the next few weeks and months ahead are particularly low wage workers who are dependent on this economy? How are they going to be able to survive not just beyond rent?\nSpeaker 0: We're talking about food insecurity. We're talking about childcare. We're talking about not having any sort of income coming into them and into their families. And so while there is some, the city can do the real work and the real relief must come from the state and the federal government.\nSpeaker 0: And I think I would encourage us also in the weeks ahead to work with our congressional delegation, with the administration and with the governor and the legislature to ensure as robust a financial package as possible. I have been personally heartened to hear on both sides of the political aisle conversations around direct financial assistance to the population of\nSpeaker 0: the country, especially low wage workers and low income workers. There's conversations about a direct basic income check, universal basic income, which we should absolutely support during this time. And we're talking about direct payments of anywhere between a thousand and others are talking about two, three or 4000 of direct check payments to every American.\nSpeaker 0: And this is, by the way, being proposed by both Democrats and Republicans. So we are not going to have the ability for many of our low wage workers to make ends meet and to survive unless we get direct financial assistance into the hands of workers in the form of direct payments so that they can make and survive\nSpeaker 0: during this health and economic crisis. And the last thing I'll say, I think the governor and the legislature are also putting together some packages for us. And the last thing I'll say to that, to the council and to the public is we are we are entering.\nSpeaker 0: Once we get past the immediate health crisis, which is in front of us right now and will continue, I believe, for probably weeks and months ahead. The absolute next focus for for this body and for the city is going to be economic recovery.\nSpeaker 0: The economic recovery piece is going to take all of our attention. It's going to need all of our attention, all of our support. And this is an economic recovery that, first and foremost, is not just about the workers that are that are being laid off as we speak from hotels and the tourism industry and child care centers\nSpeaker 0: . But for small business owners that are there trying to make payroll for their small businesses and their workers all the way through the economic and business system that we have here at the city, including our own city, where.\nSpeaker 0: We are going to have to make very difficult decisions as it relates to our finances and our budget in the weeks, months and probably years ahead. And so I want to commend the council. Every single one of the members for their work on this, but also what they're for, the work they're doing in the community.\nSpeaker 0: And there will be a lot of work ahead in the future. And so with that, I'm going to call the roll call vote, and I will begin with District one. I district to.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 0: This are three. I district for. I five.\nSpeaker 3: But.\nSpeaker 0: By District six. By District seven. By District eight. By District nine.\nSpeaker 3: All right.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. With that motion carries, as we conclude, we do have before the adjournment. We have second we have the second public comment period. And I do have one member of the public who has signed up for that.\n",
        "summary": "Recommendation to request City Attorney to draft an urgency ordinance and minute order for consideration at the next City Council meeting, to establish a moratorium on all evictions on commercial and residential units for a minimum of 30 days, or as long as the City of Long Beach, Los Angeles County, or the State of California have active emergency proclamations related to COVID-19.

        "source": "Speaker 0: Right. Thank you. We are now moving on to the next item, which is going to be item number 18.\nSpeaker 1: Report from City Manager Recommendation to review a report on the CARES Act funding and potential uses citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Great. I'm going to make a couple opening comments and then we're going to turn to the staff presentation. Is the staff presentation ready to go?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. It's on the screen.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Great. So I just want to I'm just going to go ahead and add obviously, this is a significant opportunity for the city, over $40 million for us for COVID response. And I want to just just thank the staff for their just really great work.\nSpeaker 0: And I know I've thanked them before, but in particular, the entire city management team, Diana, to our office and certainly Dr. Curley and the at the city manager's office of Government Affairs have been a great team in putting this together.\nSpeaker 0: I think the city should be also proud that Long Beach, we led the response for these additional funds at the state level. They were not included, of course, in the at the federal level, in the initial buckets of money.\nSpeaker 0: But we led a coalition made up of Long Beach, the city of Oakland, Bakersfield, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Riverside and Stockton are seven cities. I went to the governor and said, look, we, of course, put into the major care act funding, but we deserve also direct funding because of our size.\nSpeaker 0: And these are cities in California between 300 and 500,000. And so we worked with the governor's office and we work with other legislators and members as well. And I want to take the time to thank them. We would not also be here if it wasn't for the support of Speaker Rendon, who helped us navigate this process with\nSpeaker 0: the pro-tem Toni Atkins and Holly Mitchell, who is the budget chair in the Senate who was very helpful. And our local delegation and I particularly want to thank all of the members of the local delegation, but in particular, I want to thank Assemblymember Patrick O'Donnell and State Senator Lena Gonzalez, who were just complete partners on this from\nSpeaker 0: day one and an advocate in Sacramento, along with our other representatives like Senator Umber, like Assemblymember Gibson, that have been also involved in the work. And I just want to thank all of them for their support. There's an enormous amount of of support for the city that's going to take care of funding what we're already doing, but\nSpeaker 0: also really funding things in the future, which we're going to hear about here in just a minute. So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Mr. Modica. Good presentation.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. And I do want to start by saying how much I personally think the mayor for leading on this. This was a difficult conversation to go in and have that discussion with the governor and the state and everyone else about making sure that their funding city responses and had we just had 20,000\nSpeaker 5: more people or 20, 30,000 more people, we would have gotten a direct allocation. But we really had to fight for this money. And the mayor led the charge. So thank you very much. So today I want to just give an overview of the money and kind of the general plan and kind of the next step.\nSpeaker 5: So we're going to talk about what this money is. We're going to talk about the recommended uses, which are the city's costs in response to the pandemic, including public health, how we're going to support community and residents and how we're going to do business in economic resiliency support and then get to the recommended action.\nSpeaker 5: And so, as the mayor mentioned, the CARES Act was established by the Federal Government, which appropriated 150 billion to states and certain local governments. But the cut off to get direct money was that 500,000. And so we did not receive our direct allocation.\nSpeaker 5: We went to the state and the state put in 450 million for all cities that did not receive a direct allocation. And Long Beach got the highest amount of any city in that allocation. And so when that budget was approved on June 30th, we got $40.3 million in CARES Act funding and immediately put together a plan to\nSpeaker 5: bring to you two weeks later to have you approve the general framework. There is an incredibly tight deadline on this money per the state. It's supposed to be obligated by September 1st and spent by October 30th, which honestly is not realistic.\nSpeaker 5: You know, spending $40 million in that short time frame. But we believe we just need to show the state and we'll be asking for exemptions to show that we have a plan and we are spending the money. The federal government requires that all cares act money be done by the end of December, which is a very tall\nSpeaker 5: order. And so what this money will help us with is first, we do have a very large budget shortfall in FY 20 that we've talked about. And a lot of that is due to spending money on our response as a local public health jurisdiction.\nSpeaker 5: We have a huge role in protecting public health, and so this money is going to help with those costs in Fy20 and Fy21 specifically related to the response. I want to be clear that cares ACT money cannot be used just to offset offset our revenue shortfalls.\nSpeaker 5: So this is really about funding COVID tight costs. And so our goals were try to use the most strategic use of these funds to, one, minimize our shortfall caused by caused by the pandemic, to utilize the funds in a way to support these critically needed activities that aren't supported by other funding sources, and then work with all\nSpeaker 5: of our available grants and minimize our net costs and help our community. And so that plan, we went to all the departments and asked them to meet these goals and then we identified a list of activities and functions and we had to match them all to the federal guidance.\nSpeaker 5: So there are rules on what we can spend it under. We also looking at our city costs in response to the pandemic, how to support community and residents and how to support businesses. And we also are letting you know that today you're approving a general framework.\nSpeaker 5: It may be, as we spend this money, that we run into bumps where we may have to move from one allocation to another in order to actually spend this amount of money. So we will be asking you for some flexibility and we'll keep you in the loop if things change.\nSpeaker 5: We also took a lot of informal input. So we've been listening ever since March to what the council says with a lot of the needs are departments have been basically telling us through our emergency structure, what is that they're hearing out on the ground?\nSpeaker 5: We hear a lot of input from community and business and residents during our responses. We've had lots of public comments at the various council meetings and city meetings, including also a reconciliation. And then also the council did ask us to look at all funding related to COVID and the COVID response through an equity lens.\nSpeaker 5: And as we put together these program criteria, we're going to be using that equity lens. So I want to cover the three big buckets. The first one is covering the city's costs. We have about $19.1 million that we've identified out of this bucket that could help offset existing costs or costs through the end of December.\nSpeaker 5: We then have our section called Community Support, which is about $14.4 million. And this is going to be in areas such as homeless, sheltering, housing, condition improvements, basic needs, case managers to help out with the basic needs that we have and the basic needs program that the Council brought to us.\nSpeaker 5: About $3 million for food insecurity and helping our at risk and senior populations. A specific program dedicated to black education and health education at $1,000,000. Looking at supporting our older adults by 500,000. Mental health and domestic violence investments.\nSpeaker 5: Investments in our public health case. Management support in funding early childhood and child care. Nonprofit Relief. We have a lot of struggling nonprofits out there who are doing great work who just need a little bit of help to get through this.\nSpeaker 5: We've got Youth Leadership and Ambassador Program really engaging our youth and helping us with our COVID response, funding for youth programing, digital inclusion. We know with so many things going online, there's a need for funding for that and of course supporting our arts community.\nSpeaker 5: Business support. We would do the balance $6.7 million towards business, and that would fall in a couple of different areas small business and nonprofit, PPE, distribution, where we can actually buy and use our purchasing power to buy and distribute PPE to businesses.\nSpeaker 5: We could create transition and recovery grants to businesses in the amount of $3.6 million. We want to fund our our bids directly and let them do their great work and have them support the businesses and be a force multiplier for us.\nSpeaker 5: And businesses are going to have needs like queuing systems, contactless payment systems. They need call centers. We want to fund an economic inclusion coordinator. We also want to be doing education to our businesses, support them through open streets, and also be looking at economic equity.\nSpeaker 5: We also have other funding. So this is not the only funding dedicated to this effort. We have, for example, $13 million coming from the county to help fund our county response or I'm sorry, a public health response. We have another $13 million coming from the federal government to fund homelessness, as well as $1.8 million also coming from\nSpeaker 5: a different bucket of money to fund homelessness. And we have already $3.6 million coming from CDBG that the council has put towards the tenant assistance program. And we expect some additional moneys from that pot of money that can go towards tenant assistance as well.\nSpeaker 5: And so what you're approving tonight is really a bucket of money in the various categories. And then our job as your city staff will be to develop the program guidelines on how to distribute that very, very quickly to go through the federal procurement process.\nSpeaker 5: And so what we're looking for tonight is approval of those of of the general plan. And then if you have any comments and thoughts on what you're hearing in the community as we tailor those approaches on how best to distribute this money through federal procurement.\nSpeaker 5: And so that's the recommended action. I do want to make one correction, a technical correction. The appropriation needs to read for an economic development instead of 5,250,000. It needs to read 5,500,000 and increase appropriations by that amount. And with that, I turn it back to the Council and ready to answer questions.\nSpeaker 0: I want to just to add, you know, you had mentioned the county, so we should probably add. I want to just also thank Supervisor Hahn on that county money you mentioned. She was really instrumental in getting that work and that support.\nSpeaker 0: So I want to thank her and her team and supervisor Barker as well, who was great. And just a couple other just council support, the state led committee that is made up of course, of Councilmember Richardson, Councilmember Orson and and councilman during.\nSpeaker 0: I just want to thank them and also Councilmember Mongo who I know has made the motion with also helpful on the county side. So it's been a team effort and we continue to go out and try to get more resources and we'll continue to do that.\nSpeaker 0: And so with that, I let me start I have a motion and a second. The motion by Councilmember Mango seconded Councilmember Richardson. Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. Thank you. I'd like to thank all of our elected leaders, especially all those that were mentioned by the mayor. I want to thank the city staff. This is a very comprehensive list, and I think there's a lot of great things in here.\nSpeaker 2: I'd love to expand some of the categories a little bit just to make sure that we're not too narrow in our scope. I guess my question to the city staff is who will be doing the structuring of these programs to ensure that we set aside large quantities of money that it is distributed to several applicants, not just\nSpeaker 2: a few. I mean, we have over 10,000 businesses in Long Beach that are Long Beach business license holders. But then we have another I'm sorry, 20,000 that are large business license holders, 10,000 which are brick and mortar in the city.\nSpeaker 2: And then, according to the IRS, another 20,000 that don't even require Long Beach business licenses. When we talk about some of these funding areas, what is your thought process on? How to determine who qualifies for how much.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. So we have some general thoughts we want to hear from the council as well. We have not put together all the program criteria. I have John Keisler here as well as Kelly, who are going to be kind of be leading the two separate sections.\nSpeaker 5: And Linda is here as well, and she's going to be helping kind of overall. And so we did some quick math on on the buckets you're talking about. If we were to give every business a little bit of money, it'd probably be about $200 per business.\nSpeaker 5: So we want to make it large. So a lot of people can apply, but at some point we're going to run out of money. So we want to make it so that people it's a significant amount, a meaningful amount, but we are recognizing that we don't have unlimited funds.\nSpeaker 5: So we have given some thought about trying to make this something that every business can apply for, but also making sure that we're getting it to some of the businesses that don't have any other resources, businesses that would traditionally not even know about these funds and and try to make sure that we don't have it all taken\nSpeaker 5: by the businesses that really know our systems very, very well. So there'll be some of that for for for some of those. But we're trying to intentionally also reach those who don't normally hear from the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: Right. And there's a couple of methodologies I've talked about with different business owners. Some feel that their gross receipts are indicative of their size. Other the others believe that the employees are indicative of their size. Business licenses in the city of Long Beach do have the number of employees on them, so that might be something that guides\nSpeaker 2: us. I'm really open to listening to more of what my colleagues have to say, and then hopefully I'm rounding it out here at the end. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, councilmember. The second with by Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just that just a few comments here first. This is an incredibly comprehensive list. Congratulations. And thank you to staff for just paying attention to the moment, as well as making sure that the interests of the Council, a lot of the things the Capitals are discussed is as is reflected here.\nSpeaker 3: A few things, a few points. I want to I want to want to highlight. First, I know that we discussed creating a repayment plan on some of the back rent. And I know that that's a separate part of resources.\nSpeaker 3: I can you, Mr. City Manager, can you explain what additional resources we're receiving that can be targeted at helping people make up for the back rent?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. Linda Tatum. We'll handle that.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman Richardson, I think you are aware that when we took the rental assistance program subsequent to that, when there was a consideration for additional funding to make up the gap for those who were going to be a potential risk of eviction, we were looking for a way to supplement or to to make those the federal dollars go\nSpeaker 2: further by providing a match. So in short, the program, the rental assistance program is already funded per the one the 5.3 million. But we've anticipated getting a second a potential second round of CARES Act funding through the CDBG CEV.\nSpeaker 2: So that's a potential funding source. However, that funding source is, if it comes through the city, it will come through the state. So we don't have an idea of the amount or the timing of that funding. But there's also a third round of potential CDBG VA funding, which likewise we don't have an idea of the timing of\nSpeaker 2: that, but we anticipate to get somewhere between two and $4 million on that. So those are the potential additional funding pots we're looking at and that could be used for matching and or other housing assistance efforts or business assistance efforts.\nSpeaker 3: Great. Thank you. So I'd love to just stay updated on where that is. And it's an important program is a lot of concern about what happens when folks are at the end of the moratorium period and the repayment period when folks have a balloon payment.\nSpeaker 3: We want to do what we can to help avoid that. Okay. So just a few more pieces. I love that we've we've specifically called out a number of different products here from lack of equity, basic needs. These are really important resources.\nSpeaker 3: There's there was a letter today from Black Lives Matter, Long Beach that read some raise some good questions. And I and I think I want to go ahead and just highlight one of them. And it talks about our equity lines that we applied to this.\nSpeaker 3: And and what it really calls for is for us to take a place in equity lines on each individual sort of space here to make sure that, as you know, as each one of these funds roll out, we're thinking about equity and we're thinking about how to make sure that they are targeted in a way that addresses\nSpeaker 3: barriers and gets to the communities that are that are impacted by COVID 19. And so I'll give an example. When we did our economic relief package, a part of that was we deployed, I think, $800,000 micro loans to small businesses in about three weeks.\nSpeaker 3: The money was gone and a lot of the hard to reach businesses. They never had a real opportunity to understand the program. And by the time they understood the program, these are communities that I mean, these are businesses that traditionally haven't engaged with the city very well.\nSpeaker 3: And do you know whatever barriers exist? And they were they missed the boat. I want to make sure that as we look at these different funds, that we do have a plan to address barriers and equity so that we get to some of the hardest some of the, you know, the businesses that are impacted the most about\nSpeaker 3: profits that are impacted the most, and the ones that do that do outreach into black communities, Latino communities. I want to make sure that that happens. So is is there a plan to come back with further explanation on how we're going to go ahead and address the equity issues and just how the programs will work on?\nSpeaker 3: Is there a plan to come back with a report on that or two from four?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. So in any normal environment, we would have all that in this council letter. We'd put it all together. We'd spend a month or two understanding all the needs and putting it all out and bring and giving you all that detail, given the speed we needed to go right.\nSpeaker 5: To just are we headed in the right direction and get that direction tonight? And then we would put together the rest of those program criteria. We could do that in a memo and outline the general approach. We do want to hear tonight from council if this is the right direction that we're going in.\nSpeaker 5: We were thinking very similar. We're looking at potentially some of the maps that we have with the data that shows either COVID impacted communities or show impacted, you know, you know, all of our CVG areas and others that have income criteria on them.\nSpeaker 5: So there are a number of different data sources that we are considering to make sure that this money does get utilized citywide, but also with a specific focus on communities that have higher needs.\nSpeaker 3: I think that makes sense. I think when the memo comes back, the more you can point to like specific impacts of COVID and data to justify how we allocate the resources, I think that makes sense. A couple of issues I'm going to I'm going to raise.\nSpeaker 3: So I had a good meeting with some of the local Long Beach restaurants who have some very specific needs. Obviously, we know that the restaurant industry, you know, we're projecting at potentially 50% of these restaurants not making it through this this this challenge, this COVID 19 pandemic and the economic circumstances surrounding it.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that we should certainly, you know, economic development should sit down with them and make sure we fully understand before you roll out the economic development grants, like how to make sure these small mom and pop restaurants are getting what they need.\nSpeaker 3: I've seen when, you know, sometimes grant programs come out and they don't necessarily meet what they actually need. So I want to make sure that that's informed and we do have a conversation with them and lead them and understand how we can target these resources to make a big impact on our local, local, small restaurants.\nSpeaker 3: So. So that's one piece that I want to I want to touch base on. Can we make that happen? Some.\nSpeaker 5: We'd certainly welcome input. Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Next, I know that there's about 19, 19 million bucks going to backfill the Kobe. The city's deficit is released. The Kobe response and I think that's huge. I'm I'm proud say I'm glad to see that the state stepped in to help us with that I want to make sure I want to raise up the issue of\nSpeaker 3: fire. I know that right now with a health care emergency, some of the paramedics and they're doing things they haven't done before in there and there are impacts there. How is how is this 19 million or additional funds?\nSpeaker 3: How are we? How are we making sure that that is addressing some of the needs in the fire department?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. So when we did the COVID response, we basically told departments to spend what they need to spend to save lives. So that was fire department, health department and police department and Parks and Rec, anybody. And so we didn't give them a budget.\nSpeaker 5: We didn't say, here's your COVID budget. We just said spend and track your costs. And so every department did that at the same time. We also asked them to save money in anything non-covid related. So what these funds can do is they basically will help to offset those costs to keep departments from going way over budget.\nSpeaker 5: It becomes a general fund we don't allocated out to, you know, this is your piece and this is your piece. We essentially will use this citywide to fill and backfill the money that we've already spent in the current fiscal year.\nSpeaker 5: And it will help us prevent having to do additional reductions in the current fiscal year. Next fiscal year, of course, we we have to make structural reductions well understood.\nSpeaker 3: So what I'll say what I'll say here, the last thing I'll say is that I think so. There are a number of really important things. And we're going to obviously going to watch it, make sure that these things happen, understand the parameters that you have to get done before the end of the fiscal year, perhaps by the\nSpeaker 3: end of the year. I think as it relates to things like the basic needs, I think there are some low hanging fruit things. I just want to say it's consistent to the council item. We look forward to look at ways to just create a front door food access, and I see that there's case managers and things like\nSpeaker 3: that here, so I'm really excited and eager to see that happen. I think the mayor announced a basic income pilot and you know, I don't know many details of that, but the concept is the same help address the basic needs of people.\nSpeaker 3: And if there's a way to make sure the way we communicate it and align it makes sense, where there's a simple front door, you need assistance with food and shelter. You can call the city. We can help you.\nSpeaker 3: I think I want to make sure that we we know we don't miss that. I think as it relates to, you know, we did an item that was myself and Councilman Mongo and we did the item about the business transition.\nSpeaker 3: And I see there's resources here about that to support the transition as it relates to queuing systems and contact contactless payment systems. I think we have to take that very, very seriously because, you know, our barbershops have had to close again and we're going to have to figure out how to how to manage how business is going\nSpeaker 3: to survive in this open and closed situation until there are treatments or a light at the end of the tunnel on COVID 19. So I really want to see investments into tools like like, you know, queuing systems so you don't have to wait in line at your barbershop or at the nail salon where you those things are\nSpeaker 3: there. So we're modernizing as this happens. And so I like a lot of these investments I'm going to make. I'm proud to see this in alignment with what we need. I also want to just chime in and just also thank the mayor for all of his work and city staff also.\nSpeaker 3: You know, just thank the region made it a top priority to address the 300 to 500000 cities as well, because this impacted Long Beach, a number of cities. So I do want to just say, you know, we're not alone.\nSpeaker 3: We work, we operate as a as a group within a region. And this is a big win, a big win across the region. Thanks a lot. And those are my comments.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Vice Mayor Andrews.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, thank you. You know, first of all, I'd like to thank the manager team for their leadership during these times for ensuring that we receive our fair share of the dollars. You know, we know that we need the need is great in various areas and that funding only goes so far.\nSpeaker 4: You know, for me, some of my priorities are, you know, making sure that these dollars are used in a way that displays equity, racial sensitivity, focusing on communities that need the most assistance. Under the Black Educational Program. I look forward to a sincere attempt to work with the stakeholders and organizations that are doing the work in our\nSpeaker 4: community. I know in the past organizations like Tranquility, Counseling and Hotlines and others have been kind of overlooked. And I also hope that we can bring back Black Lives Matter into the conversation, because I know Don is always looking for a way to steer the group into a positive and productive conversation.\nSpeaker 4: And of course, I am looking forward to engaging with the Minister of Life and see the job as well. And for that, I just want to thank you guys very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to start the discussion by thanking the mayor for his advocacy and leadership on this. I know that we would not be here today, but for discussing this item, but for the mayor's leadership and advocacy.\nSpeaker 2: So I want to thank you for that, Mr. Mayor. I do have a couple of specific points that I want to call out on this item. The first one is that I know that we have a lot of unofficial bids throughout the city.\nSpeaker 2: These are business corridors that are working together collaboratively to advertise the corridor, to bring shoppers and diners to the corridor. But they're not officially a bid yet. Maybe they're working towards a bid, but they're not a bid yet.\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to see some of that 5.5 million that's going to economic development go specifically to business corridors that might apply for some corridor improvements or corridor assistance. Corridor incentives, even though they're not part of an official bid.\nSpeaker 2: Is that something. Mr.. MODICA That could that could happen as a result of tonight's item?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. If the council would like to see that, we would likely suggest rather than coming out of the bids section since that is really for business improvement district that that be looked at as part of the 3.6 million.\nSpeaker 5: Some of those businesses could group as a bundle and and kind of pool some of their resources at for a corridor and we can look at that if there's interest.\nSpeaker 2: Is that something that needs to come in the form of a friendly.\nSpeaker 5: It certainly could.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, Councilwoman Mango, would you accept that friendly? I would be very interested in the friendly. I do have additional questions for Mr. Modica. How many businesses in our city are in bids?\nSpeaker 5: Let John Geisler try to answer that.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, absolutely, Councilmember. So so we have we don't have an exact total. Today it changes with their membership lists. But we we estimate it's approximately 5000 at any given time across nine different bids and ten total in the area.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So that makes sense to me then from a proportion standpoint and I would accept differently. Great. Thank you for that. The other question that I had, Mr. Modica, is can this money be utilized for overtime services? I know that we have, at least from our public safety departments, a lot of overtime and probably many other departments\nSpeaker 2: as well. That has been utilized for COVID response and will continue to need to be utilized for COVID response.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, it can fund COVID directly related response, whether straight time or overtime, I believe.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Because I think this is really an opportunity for us to. This is a this is a use it or lose it type of. Assistance that the city is getting. And so if we're able to really utilize it to the best of our ability and to the max that we can, then I think we can free\nSpeaker 2: up hopefully some of the budget for for other uses and other city needs. So I know that you are looking at that. Mr. MODICA but I just wanted to make sure that I clarified that. I know that Councilwoman Pierce and I have had a lot of discussions with some of our community members regarding a park that has\nSpeaker 2: become increasingly concerning between our two districts, Bixby Park and that one of the things that we've had a lot of concerns about in that area is a lot of gathering, very little social distancing, a lot of oversight at that park has been done traditionally in the past by police department.\nSpeaker 2: And I really do think that there are lower cost ways to monitor that park and make sure that we're getting outreach and services and also complying with some of our COVID concerns regarding lowering the spread. So one of the things I wanted to ask is whether it's possible for us to try a pilot program at this park\nSpeaker 2: , Bixby Park, specifically. There may be other parks that are in need of it where we have a park ranger at the park through the end of when this money can be spent to see whether or not we can help utilize that resource instead of a police officer, which would be a much lower cost to help us with\nSpeaker 2: ensuring that we have social distancing with the various gatherings and the markets and things that take place there, as well as just oversight in general of the activities in that park. Is that something that could be utilized with these funds?\nSpeaker 5: So it would likely be an eligible expense, specifically if it's related to COVID. Of all of our hotspots, Bixby Park is certainly up there as one of our and one of our most challenging in terms of people congregating and not following the rules.\nSpeaker 5: So I'd have to talk to the chief of police about operationally, you know, how he could make that work and whether the park ranger is is the best resource. We have had some of those initial conversations. So I don't think you need to add a line item today that could be part of the city response.\nSpeaker 5: But if the council is supportive of that, we'd be happy to look at it and see what we can do.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just think it's a much lower cost and we've talked a lot about looking at things that our police officers are doing traditionally and thinking about other best uses or best resources for those services. And I think this is one of those categories where it's a lower cost alternative that provides some some oversight.\nSpeaker 2: It also is a hotspot in terms of a lot of our demonstrations and just general gatherings. Even though we're not supposed to have other types of gatherings, they're still happening. And I know we do get a lot of calls there.\nSpeaker 2: And having the police go out and give warnings is quite costly. So if you're if you're willing to do that, I know Councilwoman Pierce would also support that. So with that. Oh, and then the other thing, I just wanted to express my support for the arts of supporting the arts organizations and the arts endeavors.\nSpeaker 2: I know that they're suffering tremendously at this time because of the gathering prohibition on the live performance prohibition. So I think that anything we can do to assist them would be very, very valuable. And I look forward to seeing how these funds are spent to alleviate some of the pains that businesses, residents and communities have suffered.\nSpeaker 2: So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Councilman Pierce.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you. STAFF Really thank you. Mayor And all the mayor. STAFF For all the work you guys did to get us to this point, I think you've done a fantastic job. I work backwards from my notes since Councilmember Pryce just spoke.\nSpeaker 2: I echo the comments about the park ranger at Bixby Park. I think it's much more cost effective or expect it to be more cost effective to have a park ranger there majority of the time versus having, you know, 2 to 8 police come and go throughout the day.\nSpeaker 2: And I know that we've tried to get bike officers there in the past and that never really panned out. And I think in the moment that we're in, recognizing the benefit of a park ranger would be wonderful. So whatever we can do to to get a pilot program going with whatever funds you might be able to find\nSpeaker 2: , I wholeheartedly support that in. Sooner rather than later, I would say. I know our police officers are also stretched right now while also on the on the comment around the small business support and using some funds for the bids.\nSpeaker 2: I totally support that. I do also recognize that we have a lot of businesses that feel like they're operating really on their own or not operating, but trying to get information and resources. And it's been a real challenge, particularly for those on Broadway and those on forth and between Alameda and Cherry.\nSpeaker 2: I definitely want to make sure that we're identifying some funds for that. So support that. And the other area that I want to pick out is the item. Let me pull it back up. Stacey had it up and then I closed my out like, oh, Stacey's gonna give me once again.\nSpeaker 2: It's okay. I got it. So on on the list, there's an item for early childhood education. Care for those impacted it says to assist ECD providers. With this process. I think the way that this was originally written was in a way that would allow for all providers and youth serving organizations to provide services, low cost or funding\nSpeaker 2: to families. And I'm wondering I know I brought it up in our briefing today. Is there a line item in here outside of the youth programing for the 22 summer park sites that allows for low cost child care above five years old?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. I'm going to have Kelly Colby talk a little bit about how you would take care of child care and our youth. I'd also like her to expand on our park ambassador program and youth ambassador program as we are going to be bringing on people who can walk through our public spaces and really help with some of\nSpeaker 5: the challenges we're seeing in parks, which could, in addition to the idea of a park ranger, could could help with some compliance issues. So, Kelly.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, good evening, council members. So we have two line items. One is early childhood focus on early childhood education and the next is youth programing. And so we intend to sit down and look at those two parts of funding to determine how we best provide in-home child care to two youth who may be school age.\nSpeaker 7: So we will be working closely with workforce and others to determine how we best do that. As the early childhood effort was primarily for the 0 to 5 and then the youth programing was supporting some of the older youth.\nSpeaker 7: But there is some opportunity there to to make sure that we're partnering across those systems to ensure that there's greater access for youth of all ages. Um. Do you have any other questions on that one? And then I'll follow up on the ambassador program.\nSpeaker 2: I'm not questions. Your thoughts? I've talked to Senator Gonzales a little bit and a couple other folks. I mean. As a single mom of an eight year old. It is a really trying time. I mean, you guys hear me on all of our Zoom calls and I'm dealing with pickle jars and paint and everything else.\nSpeaker 2: It's just really hard. And if we're going to be in this situation for a long, a longer term length of time, I think that we have to really be creative. And I think what we've done with our Parks program this summer has been fantastic, even though we didn't queue up in time to get into one of them\nSpeaker 2: . I would love to see a partnership and I don't know if this is within this funding, but it's a good time to bring it up. A partnership with our schools, our city staff, all the parks team, but also our colleges.\nSpeaker 2: I know that one of the challenges is is being able to find space during this time. And when we get back into the new school year, I think our park program or it's one adult for ten kids is great and maybe we could use our college spaces to identify classrooms since they're not going to be in session\nSpeaker 2: . But I just really hope that we can be creative about how we do this. And I know that you've done a lot of work with your early childhood report that came out, I think, in 2018. And so I even as an opportunity to help support co-ops, that this might be a good time to kind of begin some\nSpeaker 2: of that work. So I just we need a lot of help in that area and it's really going to impact working families as we move forward. So go ahead with the park ambassador piece.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Just to reflect on what you were saying, so we are in conversation with the school district and and we can also engage in conversations with the universities in terms of allocating additional spaces. So the 22 program, the 22 parks programs that are available this summer, sort of maxed out the locations.\nSpeaker 7: And so we already have been in conversation with the school district to identify the potential of utilizing some of their locations, at least for the rest of the summer. And now that they're not coming back or announced until at least October, that provides some additional opportunities.\nSpeaker 7: So we are looking at that already and a bit in conversation, um, in terms of the, in terms of the ambassador program. So we already have it's somewhere between 18 and 20 youth between the ages of 18 and 24 who have been trained through the, through workforce development to be parks ambassadors and supervised through parks to do\nSpeaker 7: education and outreach in parks, to support people following the orders and ensuring, you know, a safer place as possible. So those are already trained and I think they begin their work within. So I think within the next week or two to begin to utilize that so that that will be in place.\nSpeaker 7: They will also be in Bixby. We are looking at the height, at the parks with the highest utilization and so you will be seeing them out there fairly soon. The ambassador program is also being utilized to support contact tracing and other efforts through different training programs at workforce development.\nSpeaker 7: These are all for youth ages 18 to 24.\nSpeaker 2: And are those stipend or paid positions they.\nSpeaker 7: Are paid, yeah. So the funding that you see under the ambassador line, so workforce development pays for the first 200 hours of their time. And then the remainder of the funding that you see in the ambassador line helps support payment for those ambassadors until the end of the year until the funding runs out.\nSpeaker 2: That's great. I would say that this is one of those areas. Whenever we talk about the potential of our community members getting together to have a black worker center or organization like that, and I know I've had many conversations the last two weeks with.\nSpeaker 2: We would want to try to make sure that they are pulling they're getting their community members from the community that they're going to be working in. And we know that Bixby has a diverse community, and I would want to make sure that we try to line up those ambassadors as much as possible to reflect the communities that\nSpeaker 2: they're in. So that's my $0.02 there. Okay. Thank you on that. So small businesses, youth. I want to also echo the comments made by Councilmember Richardson and Councilmember De Andrews or Vice Mayor de Andrews around the Black Lives Matter concerns.\nSpeaker 2: I also read the letter today and definitely agree that when we talk about equity toolkit, you know, when I agenda item at the beginning of COVID and the BLM work it, I know that we've been super small so we haven't had it come back yet, but it would be really helpful to have more than just a one\nSpeaker 2: line that says this is had an equity lens to it. I know the Health Department has a toolkit and that there's a potentially, you know, one or two page kind of checklist that we could go through that can be tied to some of these items as we move forward.\nSpeaker 2: So I just want to encourage us to be able to do that. I know it requires extra work. This is a moment of trust building as we change our practices. And I think it will go a really long way for us to have confidence that these allocations are being used in a way that the community is asking\nSpeaker 2: for them to be. So with that, I thank you both very much.\nSpeaker 0: You got some of your anger.\nSpeaker 4: Hello? Can you hear me? My computer almost fell. First of all, I want to congratulate and thank the mayor for all the work that he's done in getting these funds. Long Beach has been timely, obviously, with the now the resurgence of the pandemic here in California and and the new stay at home order that we have from\nSpeaker 4: the governor really makes this a crucial time in that period for us to get this released in a very timely. I want to also congratulate our Councilmember Rex Richardson, on his work with SAG and and working with them and and the other jurisdictions that make up the region where we're trying to work together to ensure that we\nSpeaker 4: get to make our communities work together and get this pandemic over with. I also want to address the fact that, you know, we are we aren't alone. We have a lot of people around the region that are that are very much concerned with what's taking place.\nSpeaker 4: And I'm sure that we will be able to get out of this in a very positive way. I want to acknowledge that and their efforts in putting this together so quickly. I mean, I would say we got the money one day in the next week or so.\nSpeaker 4: There is a there's a plan here, which is this we need some tweaking perhaps. And we're talking about that. Now, my councilmembers colleagues have addressed some of those that I certainly agree with many of them. I was especially pleased with Councilmember Pearce bringing up the Pacific Gateway and the work that they do and and how we could\nSpeaker 4: tap into those funds as well. And that core of people who would be able to assist us. Concerns that I have are more along. And it was mentioned about the the youth programing and what we have in mind with that.\nSpeaker 4: And we're also talking about because of the new stay at home order, people are going to be home more often. And when schools are looking at staying closed for the rest of the year through January, that's going to put some stress and stress on families in a lot of different ways as well, not only with terms of\nSpeaker 4: food, but also childcare and and jobs. So I'm also hoping that we can support the Pacific Gateway program in one way or another to be able to provide some assistance in getting some jobs out. We had the contact tracing program up there.\nSpeaker 4: We also have Census 2020 that we can still use a lot of help. The numbers are as formidable as I would like to see them in terms of what's going on out there with people registering and getting their names and all through the census.\nSpeaker 4: So there's a lot of work that we need to do. Looking at this at these funds through an equity lens is certainly a very positive thing to look at, to have and let that work. We're looking at that as part of our discussion that we have here.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm very pleased in general with the direction that we're taking with this. I know it's a short timeframe and turn around and just one question in terms of our discussion today, are we going to be getting a a an update or a report on where we're at with this in the day?\nSpeaker 4: And we're also having the team and I think we're almost done with the framework discussions out there. I think that's going to be coming forward. And I guess we could tie all that in together to create a plan that will take us through the end of the year.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. We will be giving additional information on as the programs get developed and we can give status updates on where we are with funding distribution.\nSpeaker 4: I appreciate that very much more. That's American. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next up is councilman's in Dallas.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you again to staff. Thank you very much for all the work that you've done. And and a big, huge thank you to you, Mayor, as well. I know that that there's been a lot of work put into this and I'm really happy to be supporting this item tonight.\nSpeaker 2: I also would just like to really quickly voice my support for for these funds going towards scaling up our rental assistance program. And so many of my residents are struggling, and I think that providing security for renters is one of the best ways to be able to use these funds.\nSpeaker 2: I would also like to voice my support for assisting assistance for our hospitality hospitality industry. As you know, a lot of our our residents are employed through the hospitality system and are one of the ones that have been affected greatly.\nSpeaker 2: So I think that these funds would be greatly used in those forms. But I also think and which is probably one of the biggest concerns of mine, is to provide these funds for assistance to help people get jobs.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm really happy that my colleagues have brought up Pacific Gateway because I know that they're coming up with really innovative ideas to be able to support our community in finding jobs. And so that's going to be really essential, especially in going forward when a lot of people continue to lose their jobs.\nSpeaker 2: So thank you again for all your hard work on this item, and I'm wholeheartedly supporting this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Council member Austin.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to just, first of all, thank my colleagues for all of their comments. I don't disagree with much of what has been already articulated here. I want to thank you and your team for your excellent advocacy with Sacramento.\nSpeaker 4: Understanding that our city was really facing a a serious fiscal dilemma. This cares act windfall. Well will certainly make a difference to help us recoup our cost for emergency responses, but also will go a long way to help a lot of people in our city.\nSpeaker 4: A lot of needy families, a lot of youth. There's money here for seniors and elderly adults. There's an issue there's a line item here that that I'm especially interested in, and that is mental health and domestic violence. You know, last year, a half a million dollars.\nSpeaker 4: Can somebody explain exactly what the thought is in terms of who will receive those, those those resources and the and whether or not those resources are accountable to the city or to to the state or to the federal government.\nSpeaker 7: That's a number. So the the the funding around the mental health and for and for domestic violence is a focus on increasing access education and access around mental health services within the city. As you know, the Department of Mental Health in the county is the primary funder and provider of mental health services within the city of Long\nSpeaker 7: Beach, and they subcontract out for those services that then support the city. Our goal with those funds is to increase the knowledge and access of those services to people who are experiencing mental health conditions related to COVID or that have been exacerbated by COVID.\nSpeaker 7: So part of that is also helping connect people to different providers and other pieces. So that's one piece of the mental health service. And then the remaining part around the domestic violence would be to fund providers of domestic violence services with additional resources to support people who are experiencing domestic violence.\nSpeaker 7: As there's been a lot of discussion about how people are staying home more that they may be in violent situations but are having a more difficult time being able to request service or to engage. And what are the ways that we can better support access to domestic violence services?\nSpeaker 7: So that's the funding at this time.\nSpeaker 4: So we know, for example, the women's shelter of Long Beach where they fall into that category. Would they fall into the homeless shelter?\nSpeaker 7: They would it would fall under I think they could fall under either of them or both, just depending on what it is that they are seeking. So that would be something that we would have to look at.\nSpeaker 4: All right. Well, we know that they're doing good work and our and our community would love to see them considered. I guess the question also I have for for for you, Kelly or Tom, is how will these these funds actually.\nSpeaker 4: Be. Allocate it, or how will we decide who or what organizations and what agencies receive these funds? It will be a hodgepodge of different for each line item. Or is there a process for for this overall? Yeah.\nSpeaker 5: So I'll start and I'll have Kelly join in. So we do have to follow some federal procurement guidelines. We obviously need to go very, very quickly. And so we're looking for ways that we can make this a very easy process.\nSpeaker 5: You know, in some for businesses will be able to set up kiosks and take applications and do it that way. If we're looking to deliver actual services, we're going to have to create kind of a scope of work and then have people bid on that and submit their application.\nSpeaker 5: So, you know, we we are looking and working with our procurement partners in finance to try to make this as easy as possible so that it's not a prolonged process and get their money out the door quickly. So, Kelly, anything you want to add?\nSpeaker 7: I think also what we wanted to ensure that the council members had an opportunity to review and engage in this conversation prior to final design of any programs just to ensure that we that we were capturing any additional feedback.\nSpeaker 7: So from this space, we will be going back starting tomorrow to do the design. And so what are the criteria and then how are we funding through those programs? So that will be forthcoming and you'll be hearing more about that.\nSpeaker 7: We're also seeking to do a coordinated effort across all the programs, just in terms of the ability to get the money out the door and in order, you know, the most the most efficient way to organizations that really need it across the city and who have been impacted by COVID.\nSpeaker 5: And one thing we know that you're going to get the requests and say, how do I access these dollars? So if you could just help us by collecting those and we want to build an email list. And when we're ready to put this money out, we want to make sure everyone who who has been asking about it\nSpeaker 5: gets included so that they have a chance to to apply it.\nSpeaker 4: Certainly. Thank you for that clarification. And I would just say that I think what we have before us is pretty, pretty broad. It covers a lot and will help a lot of people. I am very, very concerned about childcare for for working families, many of the essential workers who are not necessarily health care providers with some or\nSpeaker 4: all, but there are a lot of folks out there who, who, who without school been in session coming up in September or having some sort of modified school year for children. It's going to be even that's going to be a major hurdle for for a lot of working families.\nSpeaker 4: And so I think we've said, you know, looking at what we approved this evening, we should make sure that we have some flexibility and allow some flexibility to address those type of challenges as we as we and assess our our needs moving forward.\nSpeaker 4: I don't think that this is a this is a guideline. I think that we will be approving tonight. But I'd like to see some flexibility and maybe I should ask those. And will our vote this evening provide that flexibility for this for staff or for the council to want to come back in and and adjust if necessary\nSpeaker 5: ? So that is the recommendation that we are asking for. And the way we would do that is if we saw a category that really needed to be changed, we would ask the ability for us to come up with a different plan.\nSpeaker 5: We would put that out in writing to you and kind of move forward. Unless there was objection and the council wanted to formally come bring it back and vote. So that would be our plan is to keep everyone informed of changing circumstances and have that flexibility to make sure the money gets spent.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Well, I think we should of and I'm. Really interested. I know other council members are queued up and this is a conversation, but that had a line item on that. That area where we want to have early childhood support, we should look at and look at that very closely and possibly consider or consider even increasing that\nSpeaker 4: . I'm curious to know how we came up with these numbers. I know this is this is all you know. Quick response and everything about local government for the last few months has been quick response. I can can you give us some insight on on what was what was the methodology even to come up with the the line\nSpeaker 4: items and assess need for the budget here in front of us?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. So Kelly actually led a group at our emergency operation center, put a group together of kind of subject matter experts in all the departments and talked about what is it that we're going to need over the next six months in terms of supporting people through this COVID response?\nSpeaker 5: So that covered business and residents and and health outcomes and a number of different areas. And then we had the kind of like a budget process. The departments put together their ideas and thoughts and kind of a wish list.\nSpeaker 5: And, and then our team gets together and tries to, to make it all fit. So in some of these it was, this is how much we can afford, and then we'll craft programs that we can create to it.\nSpeaker 5: So again, we also want to make sure that we're meeting your needs. We listened a lot to what the council has to say as you talk about digital divide, as you talk about mental health and substance abuse and and those types of things.\nSpeaker 5: So it's a little bit of art and a little bit of science.\nSpeaker 4: Well, we know we have a very talented team and our health department, our senior management team staff, and these conversations have to be had with the city council. Those are my comments for now. I do like the direction this is going in.\nSpeaker 4: Overall, I have concerns. I would like to see potentially more resources and I see potentially a need for more resources and mental health and domestic violence and potentially early childhood support. Beyond that, I do think most of the needs, as I've been listening to my community and and listening to the public, I think their every just about\nSpeaker 4: everything is considered here. And I really am supportive of. The business improvement districts, the loan and grant programs to those those areas. As you know, we have two business districts in the eighth District. We also have unofficial business districts.\nSpeaker 4: And so I do support the thought behind allocating resources and getting those those areas that aren't necessarily official business districts resources as well. And so those are my comments. Thank you all and appreciate all the great work that has gone into getting us here.\nSpeaker 4: This is this is a unusual situation where we are now tasked with spending our resources in the middle of the year and prior to our our budget process, which will probably give us less encouraging numbers to work with.\nSpeaker 4: We know we're going to be faced with a challenge in the upcoming fiscal year. So let's. Let's let's help our community and allocate resources while we can. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: You let me go to Councilmember Supernanny.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I'd also like to thank the and everyone. I guess what strikes me the most is what our starting point was. It was a lot less than the 40 or 53 million. So to see where we are today is absolutely staggering.\nSpeaker 3: So kudos to those who put in work to get the funding. Also like to thank Councilwoman Pryce and also Mongo for accepting the friendly. Um, it's. We have two bids in the fourth district, but we also have huge areas that are not part of a bid, specifically the greater traffic circle area and also the Los Altos Shopping\nSpeaker 3: Center. So I think we really have to help those folks, too. On the point of the restaurants where it was stated that. Half of the restaurants you go under if they don't receive assistance and the term mom and pop restaurants was used.\nSpeaker 3: I just like to add to that that the major brands, while the franchise owner may be a major corporation, many times the franchisee is a small business person, so they deserve some attention to. And when I think of the restaurants, I just think of, well, I'll just say the service sector in general is a huge job creating\nSpeaker 3: machine in our city and in many cities. And I think we have to look at it in terms of that, that the businesses may be located in a particular area of the city or some council district, but those working in those jobs are all over our city.\nSpeaker 3: And really that's what we're doing and we're helping those folks. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I may go back to Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just three more things. So. So, first, I love the comments on early childhood education, childcare. And that's important. Just having two children that are actively enrolled in it, I can tell you they're having a tough time with learning how to make data.\nSpeaker 3: And so let's not lose track of there are a lot of like we don't have universal pre-K, so we have public and private childcare centers who are struggling to figure out all of our rules. What does it look like?\nSpeaker 3: How do they keep all those things? And so a part of this is making sure that we we figure out how to talk with them and communicate with them and make sure that when you if you go back, you know, go back in the fall or of childcare happens, a lot of these groups, these childcare facilities not\nSpeaker 3: connected to lobbies, unified, they're more connected to our local health department than they are. I was make sure that we we place that lens on that. That's for the sake of the kids. Second thing I would say is I there's been a lot of good discussion on the human factors.\nSpeaker 3: I want to just remind remind the council that last week we talked about leveraging this as well as some of the coronavirus relief funds to target in a way that helps address it helps interrupt the violence that's happening in our communities.\nSpeaker 3: If it hadn't come up on this call. So I just want to make sure that that that staff hears that, that we need to make sure that we are, you know, consistent with the commitment we made last week to violence interruption.\nSpeaker 3: I know that that's going to happen, but I think it's important to the public that they hear us say that today. So target the work that we have to do around some of the coronavirus relief and youth ambassadors to violence interruption work.\nSpeaker 3: I also think it's a good idea to talk about just some flexibility on how those dollars are are spent. I think I think you're right. The bids are a point in time on who's organized. But a lot of activity is, you know, groups who have trying to get organized or maybe they'll be a business district next year\nSpeaker 3: if it were not for the COVID pandemic. But these ears are just as important. So I definitely want make sure we have some flexibility. I also want to say that all bids are not created equal. You know, our our business district in uptown has a quorum and on on a year in their meetings.\nSpeaker 3: So just just make sure we're flexible that, you know, we want the we want the funding to go to those areas. But that means that we need to kind of work with them to get it done because they may not have the capacity to be flexible in that way.\nSpeaker 3: Make sure that we just understand that there are more than one way, more than one way to support the business improvement district. So in those so those are my final comments. In general, I think we should make sure that we're going to have to go back and get additional funding.\nSpeaker 3: That's just the reality. This this issue is not over. We're going to have to go advocate for the Federal Heroes Act. We're going to have to advocate for state and federal stimulus. Those conversations begin now. We're going to have a big state, large bed, large, our mayor, Greg and all the others to get right back to the\nSpeaker 3: table and talk about what's next. Thanks a lot.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Let me go ahead now. I think that concludes the council comment. Let me go ahead and go to public comment and then Councilman Mongo, I think, wants to close this out. Is there a public comment on this?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, we have two speakers. The first speakers, Kelly Lucero.\nSpeaker 3: Your time starts now.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. Yes, thank you, Mr. President of the London Symphony and Mayor Garcia, city council members and city staff. As a 35 year resident of this great city, I just wanted to thank you for your extraordinary leadership during this time.\nSpeaker 2: As you can imagine, the city's arts organizations are devastated by the pandemic. Our artists and musicians have been out of work.\nSpeaker 4: Since.\nSpeaker 2: March, and our staff are enduring severe pay cuts and massive layoffs, knowing we will be the industry to most likely open last. We are in desperate need of your help by including the arts organizations. In the proposed test funding, you are once again demonstrating your ongoing commitment to keeping arts alive.\nSpeaker 4: For the people.\nSpeaker 2: Just wanted to thank you all so much for your vision and your investment.\nSpeaker 4: And for your vote to support this proposal.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Sara. Next Speaker.\nSpeaker 4: Next speakers. Mike Merchants in your time starts now. Good evening, Mayor and Council Members on behalf of over 1000 full service restaurants and thousands of employees in our city, I want to thank you for at least having the conversation about the impact of the pandemic.\nSpeaker 4: COVID and everything else goes along with keeping a restaurant opening or opening a restaurant. And I also want to specifically thank Councilmember Richardson and Councilmember Supernova for their very kind comments. I wanted to ask the council, as the city manager mentioned, that the funding has to be spent at the CARES Act funding before the end of the\nSpeaker 4: calendar year to look at and possibly try to identify other funds within the CARES Act or some of the other programs to help out these restaurants. The restaurants are a true family of owners who have built their restaurants and devoted their lives to the thousands of employees who depend upon those owners keeping the restaurants open.\nSpeaker 4: They depend upon that because that's how they pay their rent and everything else. This is huge. It needs some very hard thinking by all of you to figure out how to offset the costs, the payroll costs, the loss of food and beverages gone bad.\nSpeaker 4: Restaurants need your help. I appreciate your thoughts that you may have as we move forward together. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I appreciate all the council comments and many of my questions have been answered, but I still do have a few remaining questions on the homeless sheltering in $2 million. It states that they're not currently FEMA eligible on some of our shelters or any of our shelters eligible.\nSpeaker 2: And why were these not FEMA eligible?\nSpeaker 5: Theresa Chandler will answer that question.\nSpeaker 2: Hi. So that the FEMA eligible were for the non congregate shelters. So our shelter that we put up at Silverado was considered congregate because everybody was in the same space. So the eligible is under the non congregate shelters.\nSpeaker 2: That's the difference. That qualified. Did we know that we set up the shelter? We were yes, we were aware of that, but we thought that some of the funding was going to cover the congregate sheltering. So.\nSpeaker 5: And we also use some of the state money to fund some of the congregate sheltering as well. We had state of homeless money for that too.\nSpeaker 2: What's the total amount spent on the congregate shelters? I'm sorry. I can get back to you on the number. I think it was about 2.5 million. But I can get back to you on that the full amount. I just felt like the number wasn't as proportionate to our winter shelter numbers.\nSpeaker 2: And so I thought I would kind of dove in and find out why is it so much more expensive? Or is this projecting through several more months ahead?\nSpeaker 7: And the sites at Silverado and others are temporary. And they also were something that were done, particularly utilizing staff, volunteers, others who were able to pull together to ensure that this is in place. The Winter Shelter contract is a contract with LAHSA.\nSpeaker 7: The funding is based. The funding is. The funding comes from them and they are the ones to negotiate that. So I believe that they paid $30 per bed night, including all meals and and others, I think is the appropriate is how much they pay per person per bed night.\nSpeaker 2: And when we started the project Roomkey and started to have significant reductions in sheltering needs, did we close these up as soon as possible or are we still operating at lower capacities because the.\nSpeaker 7: The congregate shelters? Mm hmm. Yeah. So we those were not operating at full capacity. So we had we had opened two we had opened the one at Silverado first. We then opened the one at King Park because those were not full.\nSpeaker 7: We reduced. And the King Park, they were then aligned partly into Project ROOMKEY, as well as into the Silverado shelter and the Winter Shelter. Given the current status of that and they were Project Roomkey continues. Also, additional shelters across the city have opened and so there has.\nSpeaker 7: When COVID hit, most of those shelters start taking new, new people. And so we needed those additional shelters to support. Those are now starting to open with new abilities to, you know, they've taken on all the practices required to be able to open safe shelters under these COVID times, which has allowed us to close the Silverado shelter\nSpeaker 7: and to operate the winter shelter through the contract with Lahsa Project Roomkey. And then also the the other local shelters.\nSpeaker 2: I'm understanding from community feedback that there are two encampments that are not being addressed by other neighboring agencies. Are we able to, under any of this funding, do outreach into those encampments and ensure that people are being housed and or encouraged to safe distance?\nSpeaker 7: Councilmember. We have continued to do outreach throughout the city, reaching out to, you know, coach people on safe distances as well as, you know, providing kits and things to help us with sanitization and others. We continue to offer services and to work with people to to access shelter when the winter when the year round shelter comes online\nSpeaker 7: , you know, toward the end of August and September, then we'll be able to have, you know, additional 125 bed capacity to support across the different system. But we do continue to outreach and work with our partners to engage in those encampments, to assist them into housing when they're interested.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Mental health and domestic violence. It says it includes an education campaign. What percentage of the 500,000 is an education campaign? What do we believe that would look like?\nSpeaker 7: And believe that it's I think it's approximately $100,000 run education campaign, which be working a lot around social media, around different billboards and busses and everything we can to be able to to be able to educate folks as well as working within community community partners who are connected across the different community members, different neighborhoods and others, to\nSpeaker 7: be able to really reach out and get the word out through through sort of nontraditional partners to ensure that everyone is aware of and has access to the services that they need.\nSpeaker 2: Great. The cooling systems and contactless payment systems, I'm really supportive of this. But I'm curious, do we have any idea in the selecting of how much money we're putting towards this, what a system like that costs?\nSpeaker 6: Council member. So so we have some ideas about different types of subscription based software that is either available online via the cloud and also many POS systems now will actually provide the hardware in exchange for service fees and other things.\nSpeaker 6: So there's a there's a number of different business models out there. We're going to be working with probably some some digital navigators out there who are implementing these systems to find out what the options are. And then, of course, working with the different sections or sectors of, of, of business types that use different types of platforms for\nSpeaker 6: their specific needs. So as an example, also in that council recommendation that was passed as part of the responsible reopening package, there were questions about queuing systems, reservation and registration systems, point of sale. So there's a there's a large range of different types of solutions that we'll be looking at.\nSpeaker 6: And we believe that a lot of the recommendations about solutions will actually come out of the businesses themselves that apply for these grants. So in our estimation, there's going to be a range of about 500 to $1000 is going to be the sweet spot for many of these systems.\nSpeaker 6: But I'm sure we're going to find some that are that cost less and some that cost more depending on what what support they need.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, a lot of them come with ongoing costs that the business would be burdening. And so I guess my recommendation overall would be that when the businesses apply for any of the grant funds from. Line 16 through the end, I would like to see a single application, a single application that has a very short section on the\nSpeaker 2: top that kind of gives us perspective on their business and then really goes into check marks and the amount by each grant category because as a small business you might have PPE distribution, you might have the queuing system.\nSpeaker 2: I mean, all of these. Individually. They can't be looked at one at a time. They really need to be looked at globally and then really appraised as a whole on prioritization of the businesses based on both an equity lens.\nSpeaker 2: And as I met with the restaurant owners yesterday and I've met with them several times over the last six weeks, and we kind of talk about, as Councilmember Richardson said and they said this to me yesterday, it's expected that 50% of these businesses aren't going to survive.\nSpeaker 2: And so we want to make sure that we are making the investments in the organizations that will survive and then working to ensure that the businesses that are most closely helping us recover by jobs. So an example is that the city, I think I heard estimates between 21 and 22,000 jobs in foodservice.\nSpeaker 2: If 50% of our food service business at, well, restaurants went under, which would be less than 50% of the food service businesses, because there's categories within that. We were talking about significant jobs. And so you want to make sure that.\nSpeaker 2: We also are taking into consideration if you have a business that employs 75 people and a business that employs five people, that there's some proportionality in our allocations in there bringing back our workforce because what we really need to recover is jobs.\nSpeaker 2: And then in any case, a lot of this can be reimbursement. A lot of these businesses have already outlaid the cash. And so I would hope that when the application comes out, they say, okay, I'm asking for $1,000.\nSpeaker 2: So far I've spent $4,000 and here's why and what that looks like. And so that they those that have already made those investments are the ones really able to access that funding first, because they're also the ones that have been reopening and getting closed.\nSpeaker 2: And I want to address the discussion around childcare. I've done a lot of work with workforce Workforce. The Work Source Center on Workforce Development and one of the areas that's been hit hard was our childcare workers. So childcare workers that used to work at congregate childcare facilities are now available to the community to be hired, keep good\nSpeaker 2: standards in their personal life, and then be available to go into your home and others. I've really done a lot of promotion and a lot of the mommy groups that I'm in, and the price point is just not acceptable for the current financial status of the families.\nSpeaker 2: And so what I would like to see is on the item that Councilmember Austin and Pearce were discussing. Which is early childhood support. I'd like to expand that to say early childhood support and child care. Work force. Program subsidy.\nSpeaker 2: So that it's closer to the price point that is really market rate. So I don't know what it is right now. I can make up some number. If the market rate is currently a and work source is charging B, then maybe we find out what that variances and add another 10% and then offer that program through that\nSpeaker 2: rate for individuals who are trying to go back to work or have been reentering the workforce or whatever we do. But I would really like to see that. Councilmember Richardson, do you think that that's something that you'd agree to?\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Sounds good to me.\nSpeaker 2: Right. And then within the categories and business support, I'd like to see some flexibility. I'd like to add some verbiage, quite honestly, to any of the categories, but I'll add it in the 3.6 million to also say that some of our businesses have very, very different needs.\nSpeaker 2: They had a workforce, a work environment that really had social distancing and other things and or they've really been able to meet some of the other categories. They might already have a queuing system. They might already have some of these other things.\nSpeaker 2: And where they're really struggling is that they will never be able to get past that rent payment. So I'd also like to see, similar to my agenda item last week, I recognize that you probably had already finished this list on a rent, a back rent.\nSpeaker 2: So march through, let's say June 30th. Rent. It payback matching. So if your rent was deferred for three months, months, and you are able to start a payback program that we would provide matching funds, and I'm not necessarily saying 1 to 1, I'm going to leave that to the staff to come up with what makes sense.\nSpeaker 2: I also recognize that some of these places have rent that's two 3000 a month and others have rent that's 25,000 a month. And we're not going to be able to get very far if we're giving money in those bigger categories.\nSpeaker 2: However, those categories might be easier for businesses to fill out, and with all the day to day things that they're really encountering, to be able to just say, I'm behind on my rent $75,000, but I'm not going under.\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to take this on and I'm asking for three, five, nine. Whatever we decide as a city, the city staff decide is the appropriate amount of a maximum amount for recovery and resilience based on their employee numbers.\nSpeaker 2: Then I would like to see that we would come up with some kind of aid in that category and as we draw down additional care funds, as assistant city manager Tatum stated, I'd like to see this expanded because I feel like the number one thing I'm hearing from businesses is they'll never be able to get over that\nSpeaker 2: balloon payment. And so I want to find a way that we can get there so that we can maintain those jobs in our city. Because without them small businesses, which the national number, they say 80% of jobs are really housed in small businesses, we won't be able to recover without those jobs.\nSpeaker 2: So that would be my comments. Councilmember Richardson, are you open to that amendment?\nSpeaker 3: I think I don't think it is requires an amendment. What we just gave direction for on those resources is for staff to have the flexibility to design it the way we designed. I think I feel like if some of these small business loans or grants want to use it for rent, I problem with that.\nSpeaker 3: But what I don't see.\nSpeaker 2: In my staff briefing I'm sorry, and myself and my staff briefing rent was not specifically mentioned on here.\nSpeaker 3: So yeah, no, I think it could be included as a broader set of things. I just love to see what's that.\nSpeaker 5: And councilmember, if I can jump in here. So I think Councilmember Mongeau is just trying to make sure if somebody has, you know, if rent is their biggest need and there's a there's they apply for one of these grants that they can use it for that.\nSpeaker 5: So we're supportive of making it just a larger bucket of COVID related costs and we don't need to get into specifics. Will pay for this, but not for that. We'll try to be as flexible. And if they've lost income and they're behind on their rent and they want to use it for that, where another business might want\nSpeaker 5: to use it for barricades to set up in their parking lot. We want to be very flexible. If that's not the intent. If you want to create a different rent program, then we would need to to move things around from the buckets of money that we have here or address that when the CDBG money comes in.\nSpeaker 0: Let me just say, this is the mayor. I'm going to go back to the council. But guys, it's one I'm sure we're moving along. We have a very long agenda we've been in for a very long time. So let me go back to Councilman Mongo and then those.\nSpeaker 2: Are my only comments, sir. That was the end. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I just wanted to. There was one item that I left off of my list. I support everything that's been said, and I think it would be great to have a lot of money that businesses could decide to use for back rent.\nSpeaker 2: So I support that as well. On the rental assistance, we we didn't bring it up because staff had told us that this was it would come back with a C to BG funds. I just wanted to lift it up and the issues that some of the tenants have had with the application process, I know that there's a\nSpeaker 2: letter that staff has around some of these issues, and I hope that as these items come back to us, that those issues can be addressed. And I think some of them were like being able to make changes to the application, making sure that people could get the application in.\nSpeaker 2: I know we have some seniors that have had some challenges, so I will save us the time and not go through the whole list. But I hope that we can address those when these items come back.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. With that was a roll call vote.\nSpeaker 1: District one. District two.\nSpeaker 2: I. Three. I.\nSpeaker 1: District four.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 1: District five.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: District six.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 1: District seven.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 1: District eight.\nSpeaker 4: All right. District nine. All right.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: Thank you. I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and make some opening comments and then I'm going to turn this over to our staff to devote go through. By the way, I still see it on here. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Think we're good? Let's read the item one more time. Because it didn't clear.\nSpeaker 2: Report from City Manager Recommendation to receive and File Report on the feasibility and recommendations for establishing a percent for the Arts Program City.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. I'm going to make some comments and then turn this over then to staff for a presentation. There's a lot of information to go through. And then once we go through that presentation, I'm going to do I'm going to go back to the council, turn it over to the maker of the motion, Councilwoman Price, do\nSpeaker 0: councilwoman do council questions and then open it up for public comment. And then we'll go back to the to the city council. So let me let me just begin by saying that I'm really I'm really proud that we're at this moment as a city.\nSpeaker 0: Successful cities like I think all of us know, have strong and thriving arts and culture across the city, whether it's the performing arts and it's the theater or it's music or it's public art or it's small galleries across across the city or performances or murals strong communities have and support the arts.\nSpeaker 0: I'm also proud that Long Beach has had a history, I think, of supporting the arts, but there's always more that we can do. And the key question that government I think should always ask itself in the work we do is are we doing the public good?\nSpeaker 0: And at the end of the day, government's in the business of doing the public good and that's what the arts is all about. I think the arts is all about doing and supporting the public good and expanding minds, making people think critically and really also being a huge economic indicator, an impact for a community as well.\nSpeaker 0: The arts have an enormous economic impact across the city of Long Beach. They bring in millions and millions of dollars in revenue through ticket sales, through people eating at restaurants, through folks visiting the city. And they also do an incredible amount to actually bring people to want to live and interact here in the city as well and\nSpeaker 0: are a provider of jobs. This proposal today started with a few years back, and I want to walk us through what actually happened. A few years ago, there was actually a blue ribbon commission on the arts. This was actually started back when Mayor Foster was the mayor.\nSpeaker 0: That Commission on the Arts had a variety of proposals and some people that are actually here, a few actually sat on that commission, and that commission provided a variety of proposals. Some of those proposals have already been implemented into policy documents and into the city the way the city operates and functions.\nSpeaker 0: But the key piece of that commission and the key recommendation was this proposal to begin a 1% for the arts program. At the time it wasn't adopted and it just was not something that had, I think maybe at the time, complete support or buy in from all the folks involved.\nSpeaker 0: And so that piece of it got shelved. But it's always been part of the conversation when you talk to artists and folks that support the arts is bringing this percent discussion back. We we used to have a percent for the arts program in the city when we had redevelopment agencies and we had that program in place.\nSpeaker 0: And that, of course, went away when redevelopment was eliminated. And so the city again was left without any sort of dedicated public arts funding outside of the funding that we provide, of course, to our municipal band and to, of course, our Long Beach Museum of Art.\nSpeaker 0: And so last year at the state of the city, I was pretty clear, I think in in during a part of the speech that we had to bring back the percent for the arts. I encourage the Council to address it and to look into it.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm incredibly proud that I think within a week or two, Councilwoman Suzy Pryce, who was the lead author on the motion, and she was joined by Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez and Councilman Dee Andrews and at the time also Vice Mayor Susan Lowenthal to ask the city to begin the process of implementing a 1% for the arts program\nSpeaker 0: for the city staff who spent many months doing research. They have studied and done research on a variety of percent for the arts programs across the country. They've talked to members and the arts folks in the in the community and have come up with a proposal.\nSpeaker 0: That's a that's an incredible, I think, first start and first step in this process. And there's a few things I just want to mention about about the proposal. The first is, of course, the key component of this proposal is the 1% proposal for all public or city projects that happen across the city that add 1% of the\nSpeaker 0: cost of those projects would be put into a new 1% for the arts fund, essentially a bucket where all those dollars would go as projects happen across the city. That's part one of the proposal. In addition to that, and while it's not explicit in the staff report, I would I'm also going to ask the council as part\nSpeaker 0: of this adoption that we ask as part of the motion, the port and the water department to also provide the same 1% proposal through their funding of their projects that they do as well. This would add significant dollars to the 1% bucket, and they have their own, of course, process and they have their own system in place\nSpeaker 0: . But this begins a conversation that those two bodies that we can move forward on. Also, while not explicit in the motion, it's certainly mentioned in the staff report. I would also ask council to direct staff today as part of the 1% proposal to ensure that we begin the next study on the private development piece.\nSpeaker 0: As you probably know, today's proposal is clearly and purely on the public percent for the arts long term. There are cities that do 1% on private development. That is, of course, is a much broader discussion that has to include the development community and our business community.\nSpeaker 0: And the only way we can begin that discussion is legally is to have a Nexus study that the city would have to perform to see what are actually all of our impact fees. What are developments currently paying? Would it be fair or not fair to ask for this type of additional support out of private development?\nSpeaker 0: Because the truth is, is we need to assess what our actual fees currently are, and we have to do it in a way that's fair to to these development projects. And so, again, as part of this proposal, I think the Council should direct staff to begin the Nexus study so that this 1% for the arts program would\nSpeaker 0: be would begin today, can really grow over the years into something very special, very substantial, and provide long term and ongoing support for our our performing arts groups that we love and that bring incredible ticket revenue to the city for our museum and cultural institutions, for local artists, for gallery spaces, and all the things in murals that\nSpeaker 0: are important to us across across the city. So that is the proposal that we have in front of us. I'm going to let staff get into the details of of where of how we got here. But I want to thank all of you for being out here tonight.\nSpeaker 0: I think it's a big a big step and day four for the city of Long Beach. So, Mr. West.\nSpeaker 6: Mayor, councilmembers, I'm going to turn this over to Tom, motorcar assistant city manager, who's done most of the work authoring the report. Thank you, Mr. Manager, and thank you, Mr. Mayor and Council. I think the Mayor did a very good job of introducing this item and in talking about the history.\nSpeaker 6: This has been talked about in the community for a long time. We were given direction as staff early in January by the mayor and council to do a lot of research, develop a program and come back. And that's what we're doing here tonight.\nSpeaker 6: So I've got a presentation. We'll will go over some of the research we've looked into. We'll talk about the analysis, the case studies that we've seen. We've been asked some questions about admissions fees and whether or not that can be part of a funding source.\nSpeaker 6: The mayor talked about the the Nexus study and the private development impact fee, and we'll cover that and we'll talk a little bit about the recommendations before getting to questions. So currently we do a tremendous amount of support for the arts.\nSpeaker 6: The mayor mentioned this and I want to put a point on that. We have a very rich history of supporting arts and culture. Just a couple of things to point out. Our Long Beach Arts Council has a $404,000 current contract with the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: We have $319,000 of support for the Museum of Art, $360,000 of support for the municipal band. And then we also did an inventory of all of our programs and projects that we do throughout the city. Some are directly arts related, some are more cultural related.\nSpeaker 6: But we came to a grand total of about $6.2 million of either direct programs or programs where arts and culture is a significant portion of what we do. So a large investment by the City Council in Arts and Culture is currently.\nSpeaker 6: So we did some research and looked at some of the other cities that are out there and how they do a percent for the arts program. We surveyed the 30 largest cities in the U.S. and then we also looked locally in California at the 73 California cities that responded to a survey.\nSpeaker 6: So the results were that, by and large, the 30 largest cities in the country do do a percent for the arts program. About 86 of those that we looked at had an arts program, and 14% did not have a percent for the arts.\nSpeaker 0: 87%. Right.\nSpeaker 6: I'm sorry, 86%. Yes, sir. When we extended that to California cities, though, we actually saw a different trend. Of the 73 cities that responded to us, about 41% had a percent for the arts program and 59% did not have a percent for the arts program.\nSpeaker 6: One of the questions we asked of the 30 largest cities is where do they get the majority of their funding from? Is it assessed on private development or is it on public projects? And of the 30 largest cities, the vast majority did a percent for public art, with only about 11% doing both public and private, and 4%\nSpeaker 6: only doing private. So we did a number of analysis on the city's funding sources. Obviously, this will be something that is designed to generate revenue. The city has a very large budget, but a lot of those funds are restricted for certain purposes.\nSpeaker 6: So in our analysis, we looked at a number of different things, including the general fund and how a percent for the arts could be applied there. We looked at what are called our enterprise funds, where essentially they're funds that operate like like a business entity.\nSpeaker 6: We looked at our internal service funds that help support other city operations. We looked at some of our special funds, and we also looked at a big one where we do a lot of capital projects, which is our tidelands funds.\nSpeaker 6: We also did some specific case studies on cities in our area that do percent for the arts. There are some cities that implement this very effectively and we want to learn for some best practices. This is in your staff report.\nSpeaker 6: But I'll highlight just three very briefly. Pasadena, Sacramento and Santa monica. Pasadena does 1% of hard construction costs on projects larger than 250,000. They keep it at a public arts fund and they exclude all of the funds that can't legally be charged.\nSpeaker 6: And Sacramento has about a 2% of the CIP budgets are set aside for artwork, and they currently have a collection of about 400 permanently installed works of art, and they do a lot of that to local and regional artists.\nSpeaker 6: And then Santa monica has a percent for the art program, funding art and public places and temporary art installations. It's 1% of the budget, and they exclude their enterprise funds unless they can specifically find a nexus to that fund.\nSpeaker 6: So one of the questions we got asked was whether or not the city could do an admissions fee or an admissions tax that is sometimes used around the country where you place a fee or a tax on admissions to anytime you buy a ticket to a public or private event, and that could go to the arts.\nSpeaker 6: And so some states and cities have done that. We are in a little bit of a unique environment in California where we have laws that that govern how and when we can assess those taxes and fees. Essentially in California, in order to do this, we would need to have a vote of the people, and it would be\nSpeaker 6: a two thirds vote of the people because it would be dedicated specifically to the arts. So that's somewhat of a of a high hurdle. Alternatively, and we'll get to this in the recommendations we looked at, how can we further support the arts by going to our partners at the Convention Center.\nSpeaker 6: They currently have a $1 fund that they assess on tickets. It's not with the exclusion of art programs, and that money is used to help support the arts through support and marketing and other types of support at the Convention Center for the Convention Center for Arts.\nSpeaker 6: So we actually are talking to them and we'll have a recommendation about how to increase that to provide more funding. We got asked about the development impact fee and the mayor mentioned that earlier on is can we do a percent for the yards on private development and not just public development?\nSpeaker 6: There is a process for that as a requirement of development. The city currently does charge in park fees that is governed by state law called the Mitigation Fee Act, and it requires a nexus or a linkage between the fee that we would charge and the benefit to the facilities and mitigating new development.\nSpeaker 6: So an important question is how we currently compare. Development is sensitive to some development costs, and so how do we compare to other cities? We're currently in the 50% of the highest impact fees, but we're going to be doing a study of further analysis to determine exactly where we are.\nSpeaker 6: What are some of the other cities that are charging, whether they're doing percent for the arts and how we how and when we would have capacity to increase the fee through the Mitigation Fee Act. And so one of those important steps is the next study.\nSpeaker 6: Next, the studies cost about 100000 to $200000 to complete. And the first step we're already taking in this process is we're engaging in a study of the development conditions in Long Beach. That is fully funded already and out to bid.\nSpeaker 6: And that is going to get us a lot of good information on where we are in the marketplace to enable us to be able to take that next step towards the next study. And so that research is underway.\nSpeaker 6: So recommendations. Getting to the recommendations that staff have for the council to consider. We are proposing as staff a 1% for the arts on all general fund capital construction projects and then any other eligible fund. As I mentioned earlier, we have a number of funds in the city.\nSpeaker 6: General Fund is the one that is the most flexible where that money can be used for just about any arts types purposes for the 1%. The other funds would all have to benefit specifically that particular fund. So I'll give an example of that.\nSpeaker 6: The airport, when the airport does a construction project, we could assess a 1% fee for the arts. However, that money and that project and that benefit would all have to stay at the airport. So, for example, we could do a art project at the airport on airport property.\nSpeaker 6: You could not take that 1% for the arts, for the airport, and put it into a fund to support the arts citywide. You could certainly do that with the general fund and we'll talk about that on the next slide.\nSpeaker 6: So those we would essentially assess this on construction cost exceeding $100,000. We will have all of our other funds participate to the extent allowed by law. So those funds would be dedicated to public art to benefit those funds and users.\nSpeaker 6: We have a wonderful relationship with the Arts Council. It's a long standing relationship where they currently give out a lot of grants on behalf of the city from that 400,000 that we currently provide them. And we would look to them to try to keep the city's administrative costs low.\nSpeaker 6: For the Arts Council to expand their role and to be that conduit for the percent for the arts program and funding our goal. It's difficult to project because this is based on construction costs and and what our three year plan is going to be for construction.\nSpeaker 6: We're hoping to reach about $750,000 over the next three years combined to support the arts. So where would the funds go for the 1% of the general fund that is unrestricted? We would recommend doing 40% of that of the money that comes in in any given year for the creation of public art.\nSpeaker 6: This would be tangible art out in the community, in our medians and along streetscapes or things that the public can interact with for public art. We would propose 20% for small grants to local arts and arts institutions. The Arts Council currently has a program that does small small grants arts for capacity building and supporting our local artist\nSpeaker 6: and for direct arts support. And then 40% where it would be for supporting the major art institutions that do such fabulous work in Long Beach today. Again, the Arts Council has already identified those in their current contract. They currently give grant funding to those and we would supplement that program and have the Arts Council fund those major\nSpeaker 6: operating, major operating groups that currently are performing in the city today or in the future. So further recommendations. We've worked with the convention center, Steve Goodling and Charlie Burton, and they've basically come up with a proposal where they are increasing the fund or that the fund that they have at the convention center, they currently charge $1 for\nSpeaker 6: every ticket that is non arts related and use that to support the arts. They have increased it to $3 the ticket. They believe that that's in line with the marketplace and that's going to generate an additional $170,000 for a total of 225,000 a year for to support arts at the Convention Center and help actually grow arts groups\nSpeaker 6: at the Convention Center as well, and do a lot of marketing citywide private development. We will continue to study private development first through the development or the development services study that we're performing right now and also looking for Nexus study and identifying resources for the next study as a feasible second phase for arts funding.\nSpeaker 6: And we would return that information with the Council to the Council. If approved tonight, the actual program would be developed through administrative regulations. We would create a formal program and then we would expect that formal program to be done approximately spring of 2017.\nSpeaker 6: And we would work with our partner of the Arts Council to develop and implement that program. So with that, that concludes the staff report and we are available for any questions.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'm going to go through the counsel here and the the makers of the motion, and then we'll get to the public after that. Let me start with Councilwoman Pryce.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to Mr. Modica for that excellent presentation. I know that the city manager's office has been working very closely on this item, and I know that they've done quite a bit of outreach with the arts community, and I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 4: I want to thank the members of the arts community who are here tonight to support this item. I think this is a huge step for us to get us back on track in terms of the priority that art has or should have in a city of our size, especially with all of the other great things that we're\nSpeaker 4: doing in the city to enhance what we offer to residents and visitors alike. I think our support of the arts has been dismal in in recent years, and I'm happy that we are taking a turn for the better.\nSpeaker 4: I want to thank Ron Nelson, who's here in case anyone didn't notice. I aspire to dress like him, and he literally gave me the shirt off his back and he told me it came with matching pants, too. I said, No, thanks.\nSpeaker 4: I'm okay with the jacket and the tie. And so this is kind of in solidarity for the arts. And I want to echo what the mayor said, that although some groups aren't specifically called out or enumerated in the staff recommendation or proposal, I think prioritizing art and supporting the arts financially, including the museum and all the other\nSpeaker 4: arts organizations and efforts that we have going on around the city is very important and I will always be a major advocate for that. It was interesting to see the presentation tonight and to see that 73 cities in the state of California have a 1% for the arts program.\nSpeaker 4: And I'm glad that we are going to be joining those ranks. Hopefully, I'm encouraging my colleagues to vote in favor of this. One of the things that I think is a very.\nSpeaker 1: Important part of the.\nSpeaker 4: Arts that we always talk about in our council meetings and everywhere we go is this idea of inclusion. And you don't really see inclusion demonstrated as profoundly as you do with the arts. Art is all about inclusion. It's about having a place to see things from different perspectives.\nSpeaker 4: And there is no right or wrong when it comes to art. It's about accepting and it's about allowing. It's about freedom. Art is a very beautiful thing. And so I think as a city, our commitment to the arts and allowing the arts to connect our communities is is hugely important.\nSpeaker 4: You know, we see today a lot of focus is placed on STEM programs and and technology and engineering and math and and these areas where we we can aspire to have better medicines and faster transportation, more efficient communication and lots of other ways that science helps move our society forward.\nSpeaker 4: But I think art really gives us a reason to live. I know I feel that way when I attend an arts performance or see the work of an artists. It really causes me to sit back and see things from a different perspective, and I look to my right and I look to my left and I always see\nSpeaker 4: someone who looks different than me, who has a different background or lifestyle than me. But we're all united in our appreciation for what we're observing, what we're seeing. And I think that's a beautiful thing. I also have seen the value that art has had in our local communities.\nSpeaker 4: It really allows people to feel a sense of connection to their community. It makes people feel very vested in their community, especially when we see art at the local levels. I, I want to talk for a moment about the breakdown of the allocation that staff recommended in their in their memorandum.\nSpeaker 4: And I think that. The aspect of it that I like is that this will be our first year administering this program under this new model. And so this allows us to make sure that we have enumerated an allocation of funds to specific organizations that I think are defined.\nSpeaker 4: You know, I had a few calls with people that said, well, what does this mean, establish arts organizations. That sounds very, you know, elitist. It's excluding a lot of organizations. It's not intended to do that. That's actually a designation that I believe as a grant criteria, which is where the from the Arts Council, which is where I\nSpeaker 4: believe the staff actually got that wording and those organizations. But I think that what that does is, is many of those organizations happen to be organizations that provide the biggest source of ticket revenue for the city. They fill theaters.\nSpeaker 4: They bring in people from outside the area. There are different categories of art. And I know I've talked with Griselda Suarez in the past about this. When we talk about our you know, there's there's the support of our our larger art efforts that actually bring people in from outside of the city and also people from within the\nSpeaker 4: city to go and support. And then we have community art and projects and grants that are really designed to spur art within the individual communities. And then we have education. You know, we want to be educating our future leaders to pursue a passion and education in art so that they can be the future museum directors, the future\nSpeaker 4: symphony directors. We want young children to be aspiring not just in and STEM or math and science or technology. That's great. But if they have a passion for the arts, we want to be doing programing and giving them that avenue to pursue.\nSpeaker 4: So when we think about arts funding, we really have multiple entities that we have to target and support. Our larger organizations are smaller community based organizations and then the concept of arts education. So I like the way that this allocation is set up, and I'm hoping that as we watch this process get administered and implemented over the\nSpeaker 4: next year or so, I would like to request, as part of my motion that I'm going to make in a moment that we come back in a year and or even sooner. I'm open to hearing from my colleagues on that and hear report from staff in terms of what's working, what's not working, how can we tweak it\nSpeaker 4: so that we can move forward, maybe change the allocations if we need to? The one thing that I am a little bit concerned about, and I communicated just briefly with one of my colleagues via email, and that is what administrative costs and things may go up as a result of administering these funds.\nSpeaker 4: So I know that that's a little bit in the weeds. It's not part of the item for tonight. But one thing I want to make clear as part of this motion is I would like a member of the city team to work closely with the Arts Council over the next year to help keep the administrative costs low\nSpeaker 4: and to help them establish protocols and procedures for the administration of these funds, such that they're on a path of success in terms of future years. I think the city owes them that level of support, and I don't want them to be in a position where their administrative costs are skyrocketing because they don't have the support to\nSpeaker 4: deal with basically creating a new model. It's not a model that we've had, at least under the leadership of our current council, and I want them to have that support. So my recommendation is to approve the recommendation. But I also want to add that we in a year, we hear back from staff regarding how this program has\nSpeaker 4: worked and and tweak it if we need to at that time. And that the city worked closely with the Arts Council. And I see that Vice Mayor Richardson has seconded that and I know he has some valid concerns and I'm going to let him talk to and I support support those.\nSpeaker 4: Bless you. Support those entirely. So thank you, everybody, for coming out. Thank you for the great, amazing work that you do. And one thing I just want to say, we are very, very fortunate and I don't know how many other cities do this, but our arts community works hand-in-hand with Long Beach Unified to educate and expose every\nSpeaker 4: child in this school district to the arts. And that to me is the biggest gift. And I tell my kids about it all the time. There is not a child who gets out of Long Beach Unified without being exposed to the museum, without seeing the symphony, the symphony, without hearing about the programs that they have at CSU\nSpeaker 4: . I'll be with their arts museum. I think that is fantastic. And to the extent that you want to continue to score points with the policymakers in this city, please continue those partnerships. Those kids may not ever get exposed to art without you seeking out those partnerships.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you. And I. I mean, my kids come home and tell me about it. And that's how I learned about musical theater. West was from my kids. My kids taught me about musical theater. West and I went to college here, and my kids taught me about musical theater west.\nSpeaker 4: So I think that education and that partnership with the school district is huge. And I want to thank you for helping make our city what we always say we want it to be, which is a diverse city where everybody has a space and everybody fits.\nSpeaker 4: And regardless of what district they live in, regardless of what their economic or financial background is, thank you for making it affordable and accessible for families to experience the arts. One of the things that Musica Angelica does, and I don't know who else does it, but we take advantage of it in our family is they have the\nSpeaker 4: family pack, which is incredibly affordable. You can take six people. And I think if we could encourage that across the board, some sort of a family option like that, that would be fantastic. So thank you, everyone, for being here and I will turn it over to the vice mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilman Price and Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you so much to staff for the presentation. The mayor for his comments, Councilwoman Price for their comments. I would say that, you know, I'm really excited to support this. It's it's you know, I'm comfortable with the 1%.\nSpeaker 8: You know, I'd love to see, you know, even more through other other sources. But I want to I want to talk about and it's really core to me. In fact, you know, people may not know, but, you know, I did plays in college.\nSpeaker 8: I consider myself a thespian. And and I did. You know, I won't say how great I was, but I did it. I went through the process. So I think arts is core to our city. It's core to the uptown renaissance is core to a lot of the urban revitalization efforts happening across town.\nSpeaker 8: And I expressed my support when this initially came the council and I'm expressing my support again today. And I just want to talk a little bit about the recommendation, the finer details, just to make sure that within these details, the values that we represent as a council are reflected here.\nSpeaker 8: And know I've had a conversation and we've had conversations. Me and the mayor, me and Suzy, about this. And and and it's all been positive. So in Category one that I'm going to talk about is the 40% to establish arts groups in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 8: Now, I initially had some trouble with that. It seemed like a significant group amount of funds to a small group of organizations. But when explained to me that these, you know, these organizations specific criteria and they drive a lot of the economic activity in our city, I support that completely.\nSpeaker 8: It places a focus on those folks who have a direct economic return. Our city. An example is the Long Beach Opera. I'm a big supporter of Long Beach Opera and they just moved their headquarters in District nine. And one of the first things they did was sit down with us to figure out how they can have a\nSpeaker 8: local connection. What I do think needs to be considered and we need to, you know, look at as we move forward is, you know, the you know, we have the economic activity that drives tourism. But art is a focal point in a lot of the local revitalization efforts in local districts.\nSpeaker 8: So there's thriving and buddy budding budding business and art districts that are happening in town. And I would consider those established programs already. They're actually accountable to city council in a lot of different ways. So I would want to make sure that, you know, staff looks at including some of these, you know, art based economic development programs\nSpeaker 8: because it makes sense, it makes a difference, it makes communities safer. It's placemaking when you can activate a vacant plaza or coffee shop or business district with art performing or whatever it is, it's a local tool. So I support that.\nSpeaker 8: And at the end of last, ask the mayor, you know, respond to some of this stuff. Secondly, the public art. The public art in the public domain, 40%, that's huge. Public art is tremendously important. But I think local context is everything.\nSpeaker 8: We've tested public art in a number of different ways through, you know, redevelopment, other, other areas. So we have a little bit of experience now on what works and what works is engaging that local community. An example is last year we did a project called the Creative Corridor Challenge, where we partner with the Arts Council, did a\nSpeaker 8: , you know, a call for artists, played it, placed an emphasis on local artists, work with committees of local residents, looked at data and identified some of the most graffiti targeted sites in our city and the most targeted well in our district.\nSpeaker 8: The most targeted graffiti site had 103 tags last year, and since putting a 200 foot mural on there has only been tagged two times in the last two months. So it makes a tremendous difference in placemaking. So I would ask my recommendation here would be, you know, staff should put some some sort of on this public art\nSpeaker 8: public domain. Art, you know, this public intimate installation. We should put some requirements, engage local communities into this element. I don't want to give off the perception that here at City Hall we're dictating what art takes place in other areas of town.\nSpeaker 8: That should be driven by by, you know, local residents and local artists. And then finally, of the 20% for small arts, I think it's great that it, you know, gives the small person, you know, not the small person, but the up and coming local artists, an opportunity to participate.\nSpeaker 8: I just want to make sure that we place in an arts equity lens on that and we make sure that we're not just investing in the same old folks, but we're encouraging new artists, new futures, and encouraging people to see art as a as sort of a pathway into engaging in their community.\nSpeaker 8: So I would I would just ask again for staff to play some sort of a, you know, how this is disseminated as staff to create some sort of equity lamp. Lynn So those small grants are distributed, distributed equitably.\nSpeaker 8: And so I would just ask, you know, mayor, mayor or council member if anybody wants to chime in on your thoughts on these recommendations.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Well, first, I think I know you and I had a chance to discuss these things earlier. And so I think I totally agree with everything you've said. And I think when you set these programs up, of course, it's you're you're trying your best to set a program up and then we'll make adjustments as we go\nSpeaker 0: and ensure that that everyone is included. So I think obviously, I think there's an interest that as particularly public on the public art piece, vice mayor gets done, that we're engaging the communities across the city, particularly those communities that don't have as much public art as other parts of the city, and ensuring that we're working with the\nSpeaker 0: local business districts, the local arts community, so that those projects are done through a community lens. So I think that's something that absolutely we support. And then absolutely, we want to make sure that as this program moves forward, whether it's on the public art side or on the or on the grant side, that we are looking at\nSpeaker 0: it through an arts equity lens. And I'd like, you know, that turn I think is as important. There's a lot of smaller groups out there that do a lot of great work. I see Evolve Theater and some other folks out there and those that kind of work needs to be supported as well.\nSpeaker 0: And so I appreciate that. And I think that as staff develops this, I think we move forward. And I also really like what Councilman Price said as far as the the one year review, because I think that gives an opportunity between now and a year for everyone to kind of gather, review, see how we're doing, get the\nSpeaker 0: port on board, get the water department on board, and then move forward with some, you know, some different recommendations if we need to. So I do appreciate that. Thank you. Councilmember Pierce.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you and thank you, Councilmember Price and Vice Mayor. Put your name down there in Richardson for your comments. I think it's a great place to pick up. I agree with everything that you guys have said, and I really want to first applaud all the leaders and activists in Long Beach that support the arts.\nSpeaker 2: Whether or not you're an artist or you're someone that just enjoys art or you have your kid, that you're using art as a tool to teach. I think everything that that Susie said is pertinent and important for us to remember.\nSpeaker 2: We have an organization called City Heart that uses arts to engage with youth and the homeless population. It really is the tool of equity. It's something that you can do art in your home with macaroni and rice, you know, or you can go to a fine theater like we have in downtown and experience art.\nSpeaker 2: And in the big question about supporting the arts is, is everybody I think is on board with supporting the arts. It's how we make sure that we're doing that in an equitable fashion. I know through lots of conversations with Griselda and other folks that this is definitely a lens that I want to also support.\nSpeaker 2: And I know that there's a an equity toolbox that's out there that's being used with cities on how to govern. And it really is just a list of questions that we ask ourselves before we apply grants. And it's not saying that you apply them only to one group, a minority group, or a group that doesn't have funds\nSpeaker 2: . It's about how those funds get gets used. And so as part of this one year review, I think coming back with a tracking system about where the where the dollars are going so that we can take a look at it and really ensure that it is not only citywide, but that we are encouraging new people to be\nSpeaker 2: involved. Just last was it last week we had the Arts Park open up and we had several different artists come in that I had never met before that really livened up our district. And so I want to make sure that we continue to support groups like that.\nSpeaker 2: The second thing that I will say is just that I think this is a fantastic job. I know it's long coming and fully support it. Want to make sure that there's transparency and that there's support again for those administering this and that we're really looking to make sure that if they need additional resources, that we're being thoughtful\nSpeaker 2: about how we apply those. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to thank our staff for a great presentation. I think it was this this this item and this issue has been very well thought out. I'm happy to see us moving forward with this commitment to arts in our city.\nSpeaker 10: I believe that the arts are part of our DNA as a city, and it adds to our unique character here in Long Beach. I want to commend the Arts Council of Long Beach for their their work over the last couple of years.\nSpeaker 10: You guys are strong, you're diverse as a board, the leadership. And I believe you've inspired me and other council members to have confidence that you guys are going to work to do the right thing. And I think you'll get majority support on this motion.\nSpeaker 10: At least you'll get support from this this council member. Something was mentioned about, you know, tweaking it and going in. And, you know, I think we have to be very careful as city council members not to micromanage projects and programs.\nSpeaker 10: I like to comment about an equity lens, but I think that equity lens comes from the board, right? If you look at the construction of the Arts Council board and the leadership there has changed just in the last couple of years.\nSpeaker 10: That's what I mean about inspiring confidence from this piece of this body. I think the one year review will tell us a lot. Is it working? Where did it where does it need to be fixed? And at that point, we can come in and make recommendations to staff and to the the Arts Council on how to administer\nSpeaker 10: those funds moving forward. So I think this is a great, great leap forward. This is an awesome step in the right direction. I'm looking forward to continuing to work together with the arts community in the continued partnership for District eight and throughout the city.\nSpeaker 10: I think this 1% program is our best foot forward to support and sustain arts and artists in our city. And although I do think, as it has been said also, it just scratches the surface, but it's a real commitment and a great step forward.\nSpeaker 10: And so I'll be supporting the site.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: I want to start by thanking the staff for a very comprehensive report. I know doing that much outreach and research from our neighboring cities and across the country is intensive. And I think that it's also important to remember that not all of those who invest in the 1% for the arts are cities.\nSpeaker 1: And we also have someone here from Supervisor Hahn's office. The County of Los Angeles. Thank you for being here. Hey, Linda. The county of Los Angeles supports a 1% for the arts. And I think that it's important to recognize that they also have a model that's very successful locally and overlaps us to that point.\nSpeaker 1: I'd also like to say that in the one year report, I'd love to see that we include all of the arts funding, including the Museum of the Art in the Municipal Band and the leveraged funds that are combined to get that.\nSpeaker 1: So an example is Griselda and I spoke before budget hearings this year and we talked about how their grant is a matching grant and she committed to working hard to ensure that it matched new dollars. So for example, if they had raised in the prior year $100,000, the 50,000 or whatever it was that matched to draw down\nSpeaker 1: the funding in the prior year would be a different set then the next year because then it really helps leverage the grant for them to grow their donor base. And that's really important. And so I'd like to see when the one year report does come back and not only shows if we hit the 750 Target, but also\nSpeaker 1: shows all the other streams of funding and the matching. That was a part of that. Because one thing that I've learned very through reading so many studies over the last two years is how arts are such an economic driver.\nSpeaker 1: And we are talking about economic development. We're talking about bringing people into the community. We're talking about how they spend their money and the jobs that are related. And arts is a big part of that economic development. I might not be the thespian as Vice Mayor Richardson, but I too participated in those kinds of things but could\nSpeaker 1: not make a career out of it like some of you of have the talent to do. And that's important because that's a huge part of moving forward. And then just knowing and understanding that this is a step in the right direction and that it's an investment more than a gift.\nSpeaker 1: It's an investment in our future and our children and the richness that is the arts community. So thank you for that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And we're going to now go to public comment. I know that we have some of our arts organizations and folks that are here that want to say a few words. So please come forward. We're gonna do public comment and we'll go back to the Council for a vote and please obviously introduce yourself and who you\nSpeaker 0: represent.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. Thank you. I'm Karen Deci, the artistic director and producer of International City Theater. And I am so thrilled that you guys are addressing this issue 1% for the arts because we've been talking about it for years.\nSpeaker 1: And so my hat's off to you guys.\nSpeaker 4: And just listening to you, I have to say quickly, I have such a great appreciation.\nSpeaker 1: For more appreciation for you in your ability to articulate your.\nSpeaker 4: Ideas and thoughts about the arts. And and obviously we value them. But to hear that, you.\nSpeaker 1: Do as well. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 4: I just want to.\nSpeaker 1: Express my.\nSpeaker 4: Support and gratitude to the mayor and council for.\nSpeaker 1: The possibility of making this a new beginning. And I know it's a beginning step, but it's a beginning.\nSpeaker 4: And and it has the possibility of igniting growth.\nSpeaker 1: For the arts and for our city. And I.\nSpeaker 4: Appreciate that you understand how that works as.\nSpeaker 1: An economic engine.\nSpeaker 4: And with so much development going on in our city, residential and commercial, I think that third leg is cultural. And they all work together and they all feed off each other. And if we're going to attract more urban dwellers, they really need something more to do than just shop and eat.\nSpeaker 1: So. It. It all works.\nSpeaker 4: Together. And any sophisticated city has a vibrant art scene.\nSpeaker 1: And I know you address.\nSpeaker 4: That, Mayor, and we are heading in that direction, bringing major arts groups to.\nSpeaker 1: The performing arts center.\nSpeaker 4: And with greater city support and major marketing.\nSpeaker 1: Efforts.\nSpeaker 4: For the arts, Long Beach has the potential to compete with other major cities and Long Beach benefits from its geographic position. And between L.A. and Orange County. And this can attract greater numbers of visitors supporting other.\nSpeaker 1: Businesses, restaurants.\nSpeaker 4: And other cultural activities. And all this will add to the economic engine for the entire city. International City Theater is Long Beach's resident professional theater company, and it was chosen. Long Beach was the chosen home for ICG.\nSpeaker 1: This is where Sacheen Dhesi decided to start International City Theater, because he also.\nSpeaker 4: Appreciated the geographic position. And we've been serving this community in all nine districts with the award winning mainstage and education programs in all nine districts.\nSpeaker 1: And we've been.\nSpeaker 4: Participating in these discussions about the 1% and strategic planning for many years, and the future looks bright with the possibility for support not only for.\nSpeaker 1: ICT and the arts but for our city.\nSpeaker 4: And I believe this opens the door to ignite growth for all. And I urge you to support this.\nSpeaker 1: And I thank you so much for valuing what we all do.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Karen. Thank you very much. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 6: Please. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Honorable members of the City Council.\nSpeaker 3: Elected officials, city staff.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak this evening. I'm Jim Pruitt and I'm the president of International City Theater. I want to affirm Karen's comments. I don't want to repeat them, but I do want to particularly point out I see t's effort and energy in support of children.\nSpeaker 6: I particularly appreciate Councilmember Price's comment about her children appreciating art. I recently saw some art that her own kids developed and found that very interesting. Exciting. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Let me also affirm and comment.\nSpeaker 6: On the related ticket support measure. That aspect of this proposal, I think that is vital to fund and promote art in Long Beach. It does certain things in terms of providing the money to further promote.\nSpeaker 3: The use of hotels, of restaurants, of tourism in Long Beach. And it is a measure.\nSpeaker 6: That will be returned in terms of its investment multiple times through what it will bring to the city. People who will use.\nSpeaker 3: Art, who will enjoy art, who will help encourage those up and coming artists, as well.\nSpeaker 6: As those who are part of established art organizations within the city.\nSpeaker 3: So with that, let me just conclude by saying this is a great start.\nSpeaker 6: It is wise to be cautious, to be thoughtful about controlling expenses. We do need to do that. We also need to do more going forward. Thanks so much for your time and attention. Thanks for your affirmation this evening.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. I am Kelly Lucero, the executive director of the Long.\nSpeaker 1: Beach Symphony, which is celebrating its 83rd season. I usually have a speech that I pull out and talk about how to convince people that arts matters. And I would just like to say thank you that I don't have to do that speech tonight.\nSpeaker 1: It is such a relief to work.\nSpeaker 2: In.\nSpeaker 1: And live in a city that truly espouses the importance that arts and cultural offerings brings to a community. And I'm deeply humbled by your support and thrilled with your.\nSpeaker 2: Investment in into our.\nSpeaker 1: And my city. On behalf of the the board of directors, I just want to say we know that the City Council has aspired to provide more support.\nSpeaker 2: Over the years, but this is an important first.\nSpeaker 1: Step in a much larger conversation that I enjoy having with you all as we move forward. I've worked in L.A. County.\nSpeaker 2: And in Orange County my whole life.\nSpeaker 1: And I have rarely worked with such outstanding colleagues as we have in this city. We I am so proud to work with the major executive directors and these colleagues here. And I know that the additional funding that we all get will go towards reinvesting into our community.\nSpeaker 1: This is.\nSpeaker 2: This is something I'm sure we're.\nSpeaker 1: All excited. And now we get to dream about not just breaking even and trying to stay out of the red every year, which most of us are doing. Trying to stay out of the red. Some of us with more success than others.\nSpeaker 1: But it's it's an opportunity for us to get together and actually talk about those extra dollars and how can we meet the needs of more children, be better educators, help invest in our town in terms of more education programs, more free community offerings, ensuring that we have equity and access with our arts in all areas of this\nSpeaker 1: diverse city. And I'm just incredibly enthusiastic and optimistic and incredibly humbled and grateful to you all. So thank you so much for what I hope will be your support of this measure tonight.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker with the great suit.\nSpeaker 3: Talk about staying out of the red. Yeah, I'm in it tonight. So, mayor, council members and staff, I so appreciate the fact that this is happening. I'm not going to repeat everything everybody else said, but to have this discussion in this room with this esteemed body feels like a very long process to get here.\nSpeaker 3: And it's really exciting. And I think for me, as the executive director of the Long Beach Museum of Art, I continually hear from outside of Long Beach what what is going on in Long Beach? Because there's this real resurgence and a real authentic and a really ground based on upswell of the arts.\nSpeaker 3: And I think the message that this is sending beyond the city, that we've all been attached to many funders across this Southern California, across the country. But I think that this really sends a message to those funders to, yeah, we can invest with them.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, we can give the symphony money. Yeah, let's give that on the art museum, I grant it's going to be so it it really does send that message and it really empowers us as arts institutions to go out from here and to use this going forward.\nSpeaker 3: And I really appreciate everything you've all done and I particularly appreciate it. But, you know, third district. Yeah, exactly. So anyway, so thank you, everyone. And thank you very much. Sincerely.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 1: I thank you council and mayor and city staff.\nSpeaker 4: I'm very excited about this.\nSpeaker 1: Measure on the table. My name is Madison Mooney. I'm the new executive director for the Long Beach Playhouse.\nSpeaker 4: And I echo a lot of what everyone has said already. But I wanted to just.\nSpeaker 1: Put a little give a little information about the Long Beach Playhouse. This will affect us greatly. The Playhouse, we're true community theater. It's very small staff and a lot of volunteers. And the majority of our volunteers are board of directors.\nSpeaker 1: And our audience are Long Beach community members. So this is going to affect a lot of who we work with. And we're all very excited and we hope that we have your support tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Hello? Yeah. Sorry.\nSpeaker 4: Hi. Dr. Elaine being Weber, Burnell and I live in the fourth district. Hi there.\nSpeaker 1: So, for those of you that know me, I. My family and I were pretty sciencey.\nSpeaker 4: I teach organic chemistry at Cal State, Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: And my background is in material science.\nSpeaker 4: And chemistry. But I don't get to talk about how art.\nSpeaker 1: Has impacted my.\nSpeaker 4: Life.\nSpeaker 1: So growing up in Carson.\nSpeaker 4: I was able to.\nSpeaker 1: Go to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, go to performances, and also for the.\nSpeaker 2: First time.\nSpeaker 1: In middle school when I was 14.\nSpeaker 4: I got to go to Moola and I was hooked ever since they had the Diego Rivera exhibit there.\nSpeaker 1: And if anything, the big thing I want to.\nSpeaker 4: Say about this initiative is that, you know, we do promote, just to.\nSpeaker 1: Echo Councilman Price's comments, that we do tend to promote.\nSpeaker 4: Them a lot. And as someone who is a trained.\nSpeaker 1: Scientist and engineer, the one thing I want to.\nSpeaker 4: Say is that it's in the arts that really drives that.\nSpeaker 1: Innovative and creative thinking. For me, the arts.\nSpeaker 4: Growing up in elementary school, you know, middle school, high school, it's what gave me access.\nSpeaker 1: To talk about access and equity.\nSpeaker 4: It's the arts that really gave me that access to be able to think scientifically and creatively.\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, I'm proud to say that.\nSpeaker 4: You know, my.\nSpeaker 2: My son over there.\nSpeaker 4: He's in sixth grade. He's, you know, you know, he's in chorus and orchestra as well. He has his performance tomorrow night. So the district does a wonderful.\nSpeaker 1: Job exposing our.\nSpeaker 4: Students to music. So so thank you for this initiative.\nSpeaker 1: And I do hope your you support it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Thanks, Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, Honorable Mayor Garcia, members of the city council and city staff. My name is Kenny Allen, and I'm here tonight as a representative of the Advocacy Committee of the Arts Council for Long Beach and as a member of the arts community here in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: I'm here tonight to celebrate with you. I think this is a huge step forward in the development of Long Beach as a culturally strong and healthy city. And the investment being proposed in the percent four report being put forth tonight will benefit our city in ways far beyond just strengthening our cultural institutions.\nSpeaker 6: And investment in the arts improves education outcomes. It strengthens our local economy. As we've talked about tonight, it drives tourism, and it helps create a healthier Long Beach in so many ways. A couple of key numbers to pair with the stories that you've heard tonight.\nSpeaker 6: The arts improving education outcomes. Students with an education rich in the arts have higher GPAs and standardized test scores and lower dropout rates, which is a benefit that's reaped by students regardless of socioeconomic status. Students with four years of arts or music and high school average 100 points higher on their SATs than students with just one year\nSpeaker 6: or one half year of arts or music. We've already talked about how the arts are an economic driver, but I thought it might be worth mentioning that the arts are 4.2% of the nation's GDP, which is a larger share of the economy than transportation and agriculture.\nSpeaker 6: Attendees at nonprofit arts events spend 2460 per person per event on average, and it's twice as much if they're coming from out of town, which is a lot, means a lot to our local merchants. We all know that arts drive tourism.\nSpeaker 6: But you may not have considered how arts also improve health care. Nearly one half of the nation's health care institutions provide arts programing for patients, families and even staff. 78% deliver these programs because of their healing benefits to the patients.\nSpeaker 3: Shorter hospital stays.\nSpeaker 6: Better pain management and less medication. This program will impact our community immensely, and I really appreciate how this is aimed at being a longer term solution and not just a Band-Aid to support the arts here in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you for all of the work you've done. I know some people have fought really hard to get this to happen tonight, and I look forward to working with you to implement the program. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Next speaker.\nSpeaker 3: Please.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening council members and Mr. Roberto Duran. Good live in the seven. He knows me. It's nice to see you. My name is Emily Quest. I would just like to tell you a little bit about my experience at the arts in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: I went to see movies for 20 years and it's true. I have a master's degree and a bachelor's degree from Cal State Long Beach. One thing that I would really like to point out that I haven't heard here tonight, we at the college, we get these visiting professors that come in for one or two years or we\nSpeaker 1: get young people from Vermont or Wisconsin or from other places that are visiting for a year. And those people are looking to build their resume. They're looking when they come to Long Beach to apply for something through the Arts Council.\nSpeaker 1: So what I saw was those those young people that are just very intelligent, you know, people that really have it on the bar while they're here applying through grants to the Arts Council. And they come here and they do something and they make our life great, or they just make a program at the museum rock and then\nSpeaker 1: they leave. And being an artist, I've lived here 45 years. I was born at Memorial, that kind of thing. We have to realize this long be it. Investing in the arts is not like another city investing in the arts.\nSpeaker 1: Because when Long Beach invests in the arts, we get to take advantage of an international college program. So. That's also a point that you're getting. Like if you want to get something on sale or double your dollar or get more bang for your buck, you will get that from the international and national arts community in little bit\nSpeaker 1: . Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And I think you alluded to the arts. I mean, the arts college at Cal State, Long Beach is one of the largest in the country and graduates, more artists and almost anywhere else. And so it's we're very, very proud of Cal State, Long Beach and the work they do there.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Our next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Hello, everyone. My name is June.\nSpeaker 2: I am in District two. Hi, Janine. I am a.\nSpeaker 4: Local artist, community organizer and educator and I'm really excited about the 1% of the arts passing tonight. And I was even more excited to know that it'll be the Long Beach Arts Council that'll be managing this money because I trust the new team very, very much.\nSpeaker 4: And something I heard a lot being said was about how the arts is going to be a huge.\nSpeaker 2: Economic driving.\nSpeaker 4: Factor for our city.\nSpeaker 2: And one of the.\nSpeaker 4: Things I wanted to also remind all of you and Rich. Rex Richardson, thank you so much for bringing up. What's happening in District nine is that arts is such a huge means of violence prevention in our community. I'm really excited to.\nSpeaker 2: Hear what's.\nSpeaker 4: Happened with the graffiti and being able to place murals in certain areas. And for myself personally, I work a lot with young people. As an educator, I do spoken word workshops and being able to give young people the opportunity to reclaim their stories is so crucial, and I may not be inspiring them to be actors or working\nSpeaker 4: artists when they grow up, but we're instilling in them the confidence to be who they are and also claim their culture and identity. So moving forward, I just really hope that all of the arts that we invest in is not just about producing something for people from outside of our city to consume or even people within our\nSpeaker 4: city to consume. But the process of it within itself that cannot be seen is so important and is crucial to building community, which I feel is key to preventing so much of the violence that's happening. So as a community member, I hope that we that you are able to collaborate more with folks like us and that we\nSpeaker 4: can also let others who don't come to spaces like this know that this exists for them.\nSpeaker 1: So thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. And then I know I have our last speaker. They're going to close the speakers list and then so everyone that's in line will speak. Please go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, everybody. Good evening, Dr. Eric Garcia, mayor and all the members of the city council. I'm sorry for my voice, but I share my energy, my passion and love for the arts, provide good energy to my books to express my worth tonight.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Lorna Moran and I live in the sixth District. I am the director of Data Analysis from Data Science 20,008. It is a group of day laborers and domestic workers that work together to produce a contemporary era and very old and traditional Christmas.\nSpeaker 1: Tell those stories adapted to the situation in our community. Thank you for considering considering the Person for Arts Program. My company is a guarantee of their asking feel and because of them are impressing my network and creating more opportunities.\nSpeaker 1: This year we were selected to participate in current L.A. Public Arts Biennale. I want to let you know, major and council members. That the Arts Council give us visibility as a company. We are gratefully grateful. I'm sorry. And immigrants and laborers, we have a place to go to and belong.\nSpeaker 1: Our work is important now and for the future generations and funding from this city make our children's culture is stronger. I am commitment to my community and with help from our council. I am now working an opening and one is small and artistic.\nSpeaker 1: A space on Pacific 20/23, the first of its kind. In my neighborhood, the precision of Arts program will help more residents like me who are artists and business owners. Thank you so.\nSpeaker 5: Much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I love everything you said. So. I want to learn more about what you're doing. I loved everything you said. So we're going to be in touch. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 1: Surely you saw. When I entered, gosh, high school. I was an artist. I went on to be a trained vocalist. I received the Liberal Arts Award for Bank of America on the night when I received my scholarship to attend university.\nSpeaker 1: I was awarded from an extemporaneous speaking. Those of you who have traveled, you know what Olympics with the mouth is. It's an award. A competition like any other competition. While completing a bachelor's degree. I taught culinary arts on the local college level.\nSpeaker 1: Of course, we all know that our two important. In order to connect the dots. I believe that's where we feel. We feel each other and we feel our communities. Do you know how many homeless artists there are right now on the street?\nSpeaker 1: Homeless artists are attending our universities. So while we were proposing a percentage of fees wherever they come from for the arts. And while we don't impose and require. Those who are recipients of these funds. To themselves. Reach out to those who are homeless.\nSpeaker 1: Artists. Singers. The movie soloist was co-produced here. And we received funds. But how many of those funds went to the arts? How many of those funds helped the homeless? Who are artists? Many of whom who do not want to be recognized as being homeless because being homeless is such an embarrassing plight.\nSpeaker 1: I did read his theater on the university level. I went on to sing. If somebody needed was performing a wedding on yachts, I got some calls to sing for them. But I have found. When the rubber meets the road at the end.\nSpeaker 1: It's not the arts. That we need your cooperation. If you sit if I sit somebody over the corner for an hour, I can draw you. I can draw a sketch pen and ink or pencil. Charcoal sketch of you.\nSpeaker 1: But I have found the greatest passion is to get people off the street. These artists are on the street tonight. It's 45 degree weather tonight. And some of these artists who were proposing funding for. Well beyond the street.\nSpeaker 1: And the percentages that we are proposing won't help them unless we stress more.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Bouchard. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, everyone. My name is Brian Trimble and I am here representing the University Art Museum at Cal State Long Beach, which is in the third district. So we're very happy about that, to have such support from our council district.\nSpeaker 3: As Dr. Garcia said, the university has one of the largest public art programs in the nation. And one of the things that we see is that while we train them here, we have difficulty keeping them here. And we want those artists and we want those people to stay in our community and contribute to our community.\nSpeaker 3: And I think this program is a step toward that. And I think many of us also agree that artists should be paid for the work that they do. And a program like this will allow organizations to pay artists for the work that they do.\nSpeaker 3: You know, they're working, they are training, they are contributing to our culture. So I think that's a very important thing for us. And I just want to thank you again for considering this tonight, and we hope you all support it.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next Speaker. Thank you very much. I've closed the speakers. I'm sure I can hear you in line. Okay. Thank you. The last speaker. Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Everybody went as much as. Thank you so much for bringing this to the council. And thank you to the council members, to the mayor and to the staff that we've been working with to bring and inform you about this other options and other what other cities are doing.\nSpeaker 1: I really want to take a moment to talk about arts equity, an issue that Vice Mayor Richardson brought up. We are definitely working hard on that. And I want to tell you a quick little story. At the end of June, right before holiday weekend.\nSpeaker 1: We worked with the county to talk about arts equity. And to date the county had nine sessions and they were so proud of themselves because Pasadena had 60 attendees at their meeting. And when it came to Long Beach, we had over 120 attendees for a discussion on arts equity.\nSpeaker 1: And so I know it's important and I know I've been listening and we are now participating in the county program with the L.A., with L.A. County Commission for the Arts to make sure that we have strategies and ways to increase arts equity here in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: And we're starting to implement those in our city through the Arts Council, and I will gladly share the information of how it's already how it's already changed. We've seen an increase in applications and in the diversity of applications for the monthly micro grants.\nSpeaker 1: So I will share that with your offices. Lastly, again, I just want to say thank you for considering this and making Long Beach a thriving arts and culture city. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Nick Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Councilmembers and our city staff. My name is Tasha Hunter. And I just want to say, just all this conversation about the arts. Arts is one of my major passions. Before I even moved to Long Beach, found a filmmaker that would intentionally film here just because the access, accessibility and the importance that the\nSpeaker 1: value that Long Beach gave its art. So I want to say also that public art is very important, and that's the one topic that I'm going to focus on right now. We have so much public art, like vice mayor spoke about our our murals in the Creative Corridor Challenge and our Veterans Day Moore mural up in North\nSpeaker 1: Long Beach by how in part it's become a destination for our community and a landmark. And it's a special place for our veterans and their families. And public art such as this is very important and it brings value to the community.\nSpeaker 1: You know, the different arts art includes it's not limited to our visual and our performing, our design, our auditory theatrical and our literary arts and public art and artwork can encompass any of these genres, and it's freely accessible to our residents, and it can be permanent and portable and accessible and integrated into our structures of our communities\nSpeaker 1: . And it must be equitable. And as the current president of the Arts Council of Long Beach, we look forward to working with the city manager and council to help create a healthy arts ecology. And a sign of a robust program in the city includes local artists engaging with the public arts program.\nSpeaker 1: Long Beach is growing with so many talented, creative people, so many of which people ahead of me have spoken about, that we are here, these artists are here, and they're part of every day and every part of the city.\nSpeaker 1: And we want to make sure that they're woven into this magnificent fabric. And we are doing the public good. We're doing our our public service with the arts. And then on a side note, art and education is very important.\nSpeaker 1: I was an educator. I still consider myself an educator, K-12 and also college. And I see the difference that it makes. And letting letting students that may not think the same way that they're taught allows them or may not think or learn the way all the other students learn.\nSpeaker 1: Art helps open up a different streamline of education. I've seen that in students. I see that my children at home and I welcome it. And it's very important here in the city. And I want to say we thank you for this item and we welcome your support.\nSpeaker 1: And thank you, everyone, for for your words.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next picture, please.\nSpeaker 6: Hi. My name is Nestor Moto Jr. Sorry for the sunglasses. I have an eye infection. Um, I don't entirely agree with the whole 1% for arts thing. I think it's a little too high in my opinion. I feel like one of the speakers pretty much summed it up perfectly.\nSpeaker 3: What? Think good to have.\nSpeaker 6: An arts program. What's a good to have an aquarium with penguins that are all nice and dancy and fancy to take pictures with?\nSpeaker 3: When people in this city don't have jobs, when people in the city like can't even find a parking spot. When people in the city, like, can't even afford a night out. I mean, I get I get what this.\nSpeaker 6: Body is doing. I completely get it. It wants to diversify the community.\nSpeaker 3: But what's it good if these people can't afford it?\nSpeaker 6: What's a good if we have to walk three or four or five, six blocks to our house in the middle.\nSpeaker 3: Of the night? What's it good for us to get tickets on a constant, daily basis if we can't find parking.\nSpeaker 6: In our own communities? And this is a problem both in the first District and I want to say the ninth District was North Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: It's a problem in a lot of places in this city.\nSpeaker 6: And this board, this body has not done its job.\nSpeaker 3: Because.\nSpeaker 6: A lot of you, if not most of.\nSpeaker 3: You or maybe some of you and people in the past have looked at this body as nothing more than a stepping stone for elected for a higher elected office. And.\nSpeaker 6: We are tired of that. The citizens of this city are absolutely tired of seeing every single one of you run for assembly, run for Congress, run for state Senate. After you're done, you're not here trying to do a job.\nSpeaker 3: You're here just trying to fill the seats. Look at your computer text on your phone. But in reality, in the back of your mind, you're literally shooting for that next.\nSpeaker 6: Office up there. And we all know that. We all see that because this community, this city is not what it can be. Like I said, a lot of residents in the first District where I live.\nSpeaker 3: Walk.\nSpeaker 6: Blocks just to get to their car in the middle of the night. You know, there are tons and tons of like there was one this morning. There was shooting marks where I parked my car. There was a shooting a couple of months ago where.\nSpeaker 3: A girl got killed. But hey, none of this matters, right? Because we care more about penguins. We care about. We care more about the arts. We care more about people. What the what they draw. What's it good if these people can't afford it?\nSpeaker 3: What's the what's a good if these people are getting shot down? What's it good if these people are dead? It makes no sense. Makes absolutely no sense. And the value of this community is not in the value of animals.\nSpeaker 3: It's not in the value of arts. Don't get me wrong, I love those two things. It's in the value.\nSpeaker 6: Of human.\nSpeaker 3: Beings, because without human beings, you cannot have any of those things you guys are trying to do. And that motion previously just passed. Anyway, I can't we can't do anything on that.\nSpeaker 6: But I would highly recommend that this board reevaluate its priorities because it has a completely upside down.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Mr. Good. The final speaker.\nSpeaker 3: Previous speaker have been very articulate, have made some very good points. This should not be 1%. It should at the very least be 2%. It's absurd to have it at 1%. I'm a full supporter of arts, period. In fact, if it were if we did not have such a recalcitrant mayor, we would have opera.\nSpeaker 3: As I suggested a year ago when this came up, playing in this chamber from 430 to 5 every Tuesday night when they were. We're not when they're in our meeting before that. At some point, however, I think we should take a look at be very careful when you're dipping into the Tidelands funds and or the port because\nSpeaker 3: you may set a precedent, understand where Tidelands funds come from. You may then have other cities up and down the coast since you're tapping into tidelands funds. Want to tap into those monies? So I do examine that very carefully.\nSpeaker 3: I would also to put your. Put your career on the line, not your career. But another way you can do this. And to show your integrity. Reduce your travel budget by 50% so you're not zigzagging across the country.\nSpeaker 3: And in fact, by the mayor, I would have the mayor reduce his by 75% and develop the art and put forward arts period. In this day of, as I said before, escaping, there is no need except as the other gentleman spoke, reference trying to build your political career.\nSpeaker 3: Those days are over. I don't know if you really studied the financial situation which the city faces. Another way you can also do it is. Reduce the absurd 20% elimination of the or cutting the tax occupancy tax that you're planning to do on the new otherwise commendable project.\nSpeaker 3: Cut it down 50% from whatever that is. There's ample money if it's properly managed. The problem is it's not properly managed. And again, I would commend the former speaker for hitting the nose on the head where you've got to put your interest at the city and not at your political career.\nSpeaker 3: I know the mayor, as we can address that his political career is we know what that's going to be within within two years, he will be in prison. So he doesn't have to worry about his political career with the rest.\nSpeaker 3: The rest of you should heed whether the previous speaker spoke. Spoke about. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Goodhew. Thank you. That concludes the the public comment. You forgot to mention how our attorney general is going to be in prison, too. I was waiting for that part. So I want I want to, first of all, thank all the speakers that came tonight.\nSpeaker 0: We're going to go and take a vote. Particularly want to give a special thanks to the Arts Council, the entire board. Griselda just everyone that that worked very hard. There. As you could see, there is a lot of work that went into today happening and a lot of conversations.\nSpeaker 0: And it's an incredibly, I think, proud moment for this body and for the city to support this and look forward to more funding for the arts after after tonight. So thank you with that. Members, please go ahead and cast votes.\nSpeaker 2: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Congratulations, everybody. We do have we have one of our friends here to do a pet adoption. The timing was a little bit off. We're going to bring her down so we can get her adopted. And then we're going to go into the public comment and the Styrofoam issue will come up will come up first.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 5: I want to talk about him. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, everyone. My name is Brittany, and I work for SPCA, L.A.. And today we have Calvin with us.\nSpeaker 2: He's five months old. He's already neutered and microchipped.\nSpeaker 1: He's available.\nSpeaker 2: For adoption.\nSpeaker 1: He came in as a small kitten with his siblings.\nSpeaker 2: And he actually was adopted. But unfortunately, his family could not keep him because they were allergic.\nSpeaker 1: So he is back in a waiting for a forever home for the holidays.\nSpeaker 3: So cute.\nSpeaker 1: Five months.\nSpeaker 0: He he's very, very happy to be here, too. So someone find Calvin a good home, okay?\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. That is.\nSpeaker 3: Very cute. Gabriel, you want to know?\nSpeaker 5: I got to talk to. You don't need that.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Status report on site eight development in Alameda Point, including presentation of update to development plan, approach to transportation disposition and development agreement.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, mayor councilmembers. My name is Jennifer Ott, Chief Operating Officer for AMI to point. I'm going to be brief because we actually have some really exciting presentations on some new topics tonight from the developer team. So I just want to do a little bit of housekeeping up front is that we are as we mentioned before, this\nSpeaker 2: is an ongoing iterative process that we're going to the council first to the planning board, council planning board as other boards and commissions. And so I wanted to just make the council aware of some things that are on the horizon.\nSpeaker 2: Before our next meeting. We will be coming back to the Council on May 19th with an update on status, say with a focus on the fiscal impact analysis for Alameda Point in general and city in particular and how we're approaching that.\nSpeaker 2: But between now and then, we'll be going to the Planning Board on April 27th with the development plan, um, the draft of the not the disposition agreement, but the development agreement because the Planning Board has to review that before the Council can take action on that to make sure it's conforms with the general plan.\nSpeaker 2: So we'll be looking at kind of a final draft, final package on April 27th with the intent to come back. We believe that packet that's before the planning board on April 27th is essentially done. We want to get kind of give everyone a final call at the planning board hearing and the planning board, a chance to kind\nSpeaker 2: of make any final tweaks or edits that we would come back with a recommendation on May 11th for the planning board to approve the development plan or site A as well as a. Prove a consistency finding with the general plan for the development agreement.\nSpeaker 2: And then we back to the Council on May 19th for update and then in June, June 16, it is our right now our scheduled target for coming to the City Council with a final disposition, disposition development agreement, development agreement and all the other kind of transaction documents that make up the package for site.\nSpeaker 2: But I did want to say that the development plan is approved. The final approval actually is by the planning board that, as we said earlier, that's scheduled for May 11th at this point. We are. Thank you. If the.\nSpeaker 2: We'd love to get the city council's kind of some comments tonight. We have time. Until April 30th or, you know, April 27th if there are written comments. The city council would like to make. You're welcome to do that.\nSpeaker 2: We can incorporate those comments. Also, if what the planning board approves on May 11th, a city council would like to call that a full review for city council. Fine. You know, to to take a look at our approve.\nSpeaker 2: You could call that for review on May 19th when we're here back here for our status update. But technically, the way the city's process works is that the planning board makes the final approval on the development plan unless it's called for review by the city council.\nSpeaker 2: So we just want to make sure we just don't want any surprises. So about that process so everyone understands we've obviously you've seen this developing plan many times. We've been updating it. We've made the one that's before you on the dais tonight is there's been more edits and changes to it to respond really to your comments and\nSpeaker 2: the community's comments. You're going to hear from those about those briefly from the architect to put this together. Then you're going to hear from the transportation consultant on the Transportation Demand Management Compliance Strategy for site A. And then lastly, there was a request for shooting with a really good one about the commercial strategy, both commercial in terms\nSpeaker 2: of, you know, not retail and other non-retail commercial uses and what the strategy is for attracting those to the base. So it's a great, very exciting presentation tonight. So I'm going to stop talking and turn it over to David Israel with our architects to just give you a quick update, show you some pictures of the development plan\nSpeaker 2: , the latest, and then we'll keep going through that agenda. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the city council. Nice to see you again. And as Jennifer mentioned, we have a lot to go through. So I'm going to keep my comments very brief. I wanted to just bring you up to date on some of the refinements and additions to the development plan package that we've been putting\nSpeaker 3: together in direct response to the comments we've received from this party and members of the Planning Board and the community at large. So as you may recall, just as a refresher, this was the initial development plan that we had presented up on the screen that has now been refined and tightened up to be much more accurate and\nSpeaker 3: much more specific in all of the various components that were mentioned, things like the historic boundary and so forth have been defined. All of the items, as I mentioned, that have been discussed at this at this body have been reflected in this plan.\nSpeaker 3: One of the comments that was also requested or one of the items that was also requested, was that we show the proximity of the ferry, the ferry terminal to site A, and so that has that exhibit has been added as requested.\nSpeaker 3: And then we have gone through and done further refinements, added both plan refinements, plan detail and additional imagery to help convey the feel and character of some of the public realm elements, including the open spaces adjacent to the waterfront park.\nSpeaker 3: Again, just as a reminder, all of these will be coming back for detailed review, detailed design, review process. So this is purely for the the overall plan discussion, the discussion about the entry portal and characteristics associated with the nature of that entry.\nSpeaker 3: Those have been reflected in the new plan as well as some of the character images associated with that. And then in direct response again to comments by this body, the aerial perspective to show the general buildup of massing from the existing residential as we move towards the nodal center of Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 3: So one looking for from the residential, the other looking from the water to start to give you a sense of how this really sort of feeds into the context of the region, which I think is a really telling slide and I'm glad it was requested by this body.\nSpeaker 3: I think it's helpful for people to see. Again, just issues of the waterfront park and open space. The primary issue here that I wanted to bring your attention to is the refinements to the neighborhood park. As you might recall in the earlier development, we had a road encircling that entire neighborhood park.\nSpeaker 3: And that that that one of those roads adjacent to the existing commercial buildings has been eliminated to create a broader green space than we had before. Again, in direct response, both to comments from this board and the planning board as well.\nSpeaker 3: And then we started to really just take our first few snapshots of what we think this might start to feel like as a space. This diagram shows those three view perspectives. This set at Building 77 with the adjacent kind of community activity spaces on either side and the the the broad public green in front of the old\nSpeaker 3: Pan-Am building 77 and what the scale and character of that is intended to be. Again, just as a reminder, we did reduce the height of those buildings from the original precise plans designation of 55 feet down to 35 feet, a perspective of existing building 113 and you can see the existing building in the image to the to\nSpeaker 3: the lower left. So that's the scene today. The idea is that building is is right on the waterfront. So to use it both as a opportunity for people to have active use dining and so forth adjacent to the water and then potential for the sailing center and new other commercial and retail uses.\nSpeaker 3: And then lastly, building 67, the existing building shown in the image to the lower left and what the context of that component of the urban park that we've discussed on many occasions with this body, what the character of that space is starting to feel like and what the nature of those existing buildings can really become, which is\nSpeaker 3: very exciting. So that is where we are. And as I say, we will you will be receiving the, you know, the overall entire development package, but wanted to just highlight those things which have been further refined and changed.\nSpeaker 3: So I am available to answer questions, but I can do that now, or you can wait until you've seen the remainder of the presentation.\nSpeaker 5: Council.\nSpeaker 0: Any comments at this point?\nSpeaker 6: Amber Ashcraft This is just a compliment to the the development team of a couple of Saturdays ago. They held a walking tour and you were one of the presenters, right? And I've some 300 Alameda INS came out to take the tour and there were different groups.\nSpeaker 6: I was in one of them. And it was very inspiring to actually be able to walk on these streets and to see the view corridors, what they look like now, that building that you just showed that is is actually the one that's that's going to be adaptively reuse building that 150 is it 6767.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. And I mean and there's a number of them that are going to be actively reused but adaptively reuse. But anyway, it was really a nice opportunity to be able to be out there and get the scale and the pedestrian scale.\nSpeaker 6: It was a walking tour. So thank you all for putting that together.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, we did have all of these images present at that tour, so people really had an opportunity to stand right in the location where these images were generated from. So it was a really successful and exciting tour. There was a lot of a lot of energy and excitement at Amir.\nSpeaker 0: Remember Day.\nSpeaker 7: I had a chance to take part in that. That was a very good, good Saturday morning there. And there were in the group that I was with, there was a lot of questions by the people with regard to Building 67 because the Pan Am building is nearby.\nSpeaker 7: I think I think one of the aerial renderings really is very helpful in that regard and helping people. And I get a sense visually how the new buildings complement or not complement what's there. I also like the aerial in the sense of how it kind of shows the proximity of Building 13 and the and the space dedicated\nSpeaker 7: to a water use there. Because that was a question that I had raised. And I think this is very helpful. I mean, there's another slide to that that's also very helpful in that regard. So I appreciate this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: And there has been quite a bit of study in direct response to your comments about the scale of that that space between building 113 and the waterfront and also very sensitive addressing of sea level rise and how we can do that and still make it fully accessible.\nSpeaker 3: So those things have all been considered in a much more detailed way.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: The other council comments that we can proceed with your presentation.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Good evening, Mayor. Members of the council, members of the public. My name is Phil Olmstead from Nelson Ayer Consulting Associates. We're working on the transportation strategy, the team compliance strategy for Site A. I'm going to provide you an overview of the draft compliance strategy this evening.\nSpeaker 10: I want to emphasize that this is not a this is not final. We're still working with city staff to refine the program and certainly implementation of many of the specific programs. The details of that are still being worked out.\nSpeaker 10: And obviously we're seeking your feedback here tonight and we'll be incorporating that as we move forward. As you're all aware, the ER for Alameda Point requires that transportation demand management be a mitigation measure and the 2014 team plan provides guidelines for how that will be implemented.\nSpeaker 10: This is site compliance strategy. The primary goal, of course, is to reduce peak hour vehicle trips per city policy. Alameda Point Partners, the developer and its successors have an obligation to do that, and we'll be doing so as part of as part of their project.\nSpeaker 10: And we believe we have designed a team program that will allow them to meet those obligations. I want to make four quick additional points about our overall approach to transportation demand management. One is that the TMA is really, really going to play a crucial role in making sure that implementation and management of these programs is as effective\nSpeaker 10: as possible. I encourage you all not to fixate on one specific any specific strategy in isolation, but really think of how all these strategies work together as a package and how they support one another to achieve the goals.\nSpeaker 10: This is a living document. We will be refining it as the project is developed, as tenants move in. As we learn more about the travel patterns of the residents and employees and how people are getting to and from the site.\nSpeaker 10: And finally, this is part of a coordinated one piece of a coordinated citywide effort to address traffic and transportation issues. And Alameda Point Partners is really committed to being a part of that discussion. We see this project as being a catalyst for that, for further discussion around that issue.\nSpeaker 10: So what exactly is Alameda Point Partners proposing? This is a summary diagram. I don't expect you to strain your eyes too hard, but I want to. What I really want to illustrate here is that it is meeting the required elements of the 2014 TDM guidelines as well as going above and beyond those guidelines.\nSpeaker 10: So Alameda Point Partners is really making a firm commitment to meet its obligation, and we're still going to be working out and finalizing the implementation of all these programs moving forward. I want to step back in and talk about the infrastructure piece because it's not just about the TDM programs in the policies, but how infrastructure, how important\nSpeaker 10: infrastructure is to supporting and providing a framework to make sure that those policies and programs work. Almeida Point Partners is making a significant investment in multi-modal infrastructure. The ferry terminal. It's proximity to site a really make this a really convenient and accessible transit option.\nSpeaker 10: The new bus infrastructure, both the dedicated lanes stop amenities will provide enhanced connections throughout the island and to the region as a whole, making transit much more attractive at Alameda Point than it is today. If you want to get people biking and walking, you have to provide them the facilities to do so.\nSpeaker 10: They want safe. They want they want safe facilities. They want convenient facilities. They want accessible facilities in the street network. And the infrastructure that's being proposed really will allow people to walk and bike safely in this in this new community.\nSpeaker 10: Management and marketing is crucial to the success of the program. If people don't know what programs are out there, they're not going to take advantage of them. The ultimate goal is to make it easy to take it, to make it easy to sign up and administer the program as well, so that once again, the TMA is crucial\nSpeaker 10: to that effort. It's going be responsible for team implementation. Alameda Point Partners will be a key member, but the board and the stakeholders will grow over time as Alameda Point develops. And those Stakers stakeholders should really be invested in the day to day management of the TMA program or the TMA and the team program.\nSpeaker 10: In addition to a site a coordinator on site coordinator that's going to liaise with the TMA staff in the city of Alameda. We're proposing that there be onsite representation at both all of the residential units as well as with the Commercial Tenant Association.\nSpeaker 10: This direct interface with residents and employees will be really crucial to making sure people are aware of the programs and can sign up and participate easily. Marketing will be diverse. Getting the word out there as best as we can, as much as we can in as many different formats and venues as we can.\nSpeaker 10: So a dedicated website for the for the TMA and for the for Alameda point. And utilizing social media and new technologies as well to get to get the information out there is crucial. So what are some of the specific strategies?\nSpeaker 10: One of the key ones is a as a direct, fast and convenient connection to BART allowing residents, employees, visitors to and from Alameda point to access that regional transit service. We're still figuring out the service plan of how this is going to work, where exactly we're going to go, where the stops are going to be.\nSpeaker 10: But in general, I want to emphasize that we're we're the initial plan will we'll start small, but we'll design it so that it can grow as ridership as the site develops. I would also note that the proposal, what we're proposing is 15 minutes service in the peak period.\nSpeaker 10: We really think that's important to make it a convenient choice and a convenient mode for people to connect to BART. And I would note that that it goes above and beyond what is outlined in the 2014 TDM plan.\nSpeaker 10: If you want to get people riding transit, one of the best ways to do that is to provide financial incentives. We're not talking about getting everyone to ride transit for all of their trips. We're talking about getting a portion of people to take a portion of their trips on transit.\nSpeaker 10: So we'll be providing transit subsidies. One of those subsidies will be the easy pass program that's offered by AC transit. This essentially eliminates the cost barrier, the convenience barrier that a lot of people encounter when they want to continue to ride transit or try taking transit for the first time.\nSpeaker 10: And once again, we're working out the details of this program, and it's going to require some negotiations with AC transit. But we ultimately want to maximize the coordination with the TMA, the city and AC transit. One of the things that the developer is proposing is an additional subsidy that goes beyond what is required in the plan to\nSpeaker 10: provide an additional per month subsidy to employees, essentially clipper cash that would allow employees to use any transit service that they want. So the ferry, BART, whatever it may be, and this is once again really trying to incentivize transit use to and from the island.\nSpeaker 10: Additional investments are key. Car sharing. Bike sharing are all part of supportive strategies that will really.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Remember Audi.\nSpeaker 2: High tech.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, sure.\nSpeaker 8: So quick, go back to the subsidies and then the screen before. Also when you were talking about the.\nSpeaker 10: This one or.\nSpeaker 8: The other, the last mile. So the cost of that is the public. And to be able to see the numbers and how how much this costs, how much the developer is paying, how much the public is expected to pay, and you know how financially stable that is in the long run.\nSpeaker 8: For example, like when it assuming site is finished at some point in time, you know, what are the obligations going forward long term? I mean, is that something we're going to be responsible for? Is that developer going to be paying in perpetuity?\nSpeaker 8: Are the rest? I'm just curious about some of those things.\nSpeaker 10: Those are all great questions. And I think the answer is we're we're still figuring out all those details right now. You know, the cost of the service is largely dependent on on how much service you want to provide.\nSpeaker 10: How frequent do you want to be? How many service hours are you providing? Right now, we're we're we're trying to design a program that is as cost effective as possible that that, you know, ultimately fits within the within the financial constraints of the developer, that the funding strategy will be diverse.\nSpeaker 10: And, you know, I don't know if city staff when I want to talk about that as well I can.\nSpeaker 7: Joe Ernst, allow me to point partners. So yes, we will be more than happy to share our costs, our, you know, sources of revenue.\nSpeaker 8: Which will be a combination of.\nSpeaker 7: Assessments on the properties, parking revenues, grants, all those things. You know, as we fine tune this program and, and dial it in, we will be more than happy to share it, be completely.\nSpeaker 8: Transparent and less worried about when when you're here, then more worried about when, when you're finished.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. No, it'll. It'll all be documented and tied to the property. Run with the land.\nSpeaker 0: Remember they Daisuke.\nSpeaker 7: What excites me about this slide, I think you can kind of guess, is the third bullet point every 15 minutes in peak periods. I mean, for those who don't know Alameda landing I think runs I think it's every 30 minutes or could be every 20 minutes I get mixed up marina village runs every 30 minutes or every\nSpeaker 7: 20 minutes one of the two. And I think. We would all love to have a ten minute headways that that that the merry go round has. But if we can get 15 minutes every 15 minutes. A and B, if if if our hypothesis is right that the availability of this free shuttle is going to spur even more\nSpeaker 7: people to take it, then, you know, the demand to go from 15 minutes to 10 minutes might be there. Yeah. So 15 minutes is a great start and it's light years ahead of 30 minutes headways for sure. So and I think this is important because, you know, we're going to be hashing out the business deal, the terms\nSpeaker 7: of the agreement and air here is something that is there that will be within the DDA, though, if for whatever reason, you know, there's some backsliding to 25 minute, hey, why is this going 25 minutes? Why is it going 30 minutes?\nSpeaker 7: You know, we here's the contract basically or one deal point. So I'm really happy to see that.\nSpeaker 10: You know, I would I mean, I would note that the what we were talking about with I guess it's the fifth bullet point performance based contract that would that would whatever would essentially happen would be the HTML or the city would issue an RFP to operate this service.\nSpeaker 10: We would hope that AC transit would would be you know, they would be the natural provider for the service or really coordinate with their future plans for for service on the island. But there would be provisions within that contract that whoever operates it would have to meet.\nSpeaker 0: Remember Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 6: I think this is as good a time as any to raise this. This was a question slash suggestion that came from one of the members of my walking group on that Saturday tour of the site. They wanted to know what the possibility would be of having light rail, a light rail system that connected Alameda point to the\nSpeaker 6: rest of the island and before the developer falls over in a dead fade. And I suggest now that we add that, but it's something, I think, for the council to just consider in for city staff that some day it might be nice to have that kind of connectivity.\nSpeaker 6: I'm really excited about the the proposals that are are in the the team plan. But I'm just you know, we have a whole island that we'd like to to get connected out here too. So, you know, it's the kind of business you do, not specifically your task on this one.\nSpeaker 10: But would you would you like me to respond?\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Yeah.\nSpeaker 10: I mean, a light rail service is is you know, it's it's a matter of scale, right. And it's it's extremely expensive to build light rail. So you're going to be evaluating that in a series of trade offs. And, you know, the AC Transit has plans for BRT service, which really provides a cost effective solution to improving transit\nSpeaker 10: service on the island. You know, BRT systems have always have, have have scaled to LRT in other contexts before. But certainly what we're talking about now, I would not support light rail service. I think we're a long way from there, but it's it's certainly something to keep in mind as as the city talks about its overall approach\nSpeaker 10: to transportation. Thank you. Yes. Okay. So additional investments are really key. These are supportive strategies that that allow folks to really begin to transit, take transit, bike and walk. So car, car sharing, bike sharing are really designed to support those those trips, those mid-day trips, those those errands that that folks might have.\nSpeaker 10: There's a whole host of employee programs that we will be instituting. I'm not going to go through these in a tremendous amount of detail. But the ultimate goal here is to provide a lot of options for employees, whether it's financial subsidies, whether it's programs like Guaranteed Right Home, which eliminates some of the convenience factor, convenience barriers that\nSpeaker 10: that employee that people taking transit or biking or walking might have. And these would be required through leasing agreements to the greatest extent possible. Parking is crucial to meeting the trip goals and how much parking you supply and how you manage it.\nSpeaker 10: The zoning code and the team plan really set the the city policy around parking and we're just trying to meet those policies already adopted by the city. So the parking will be provided, there will be parking provided. That's in the development plan.\nSpeaker 10: It's going to be provided to support the target market. And I think that's something that Joe's team is really taking a closer look at, but it's going to be provided in compliance with the code and will not exceed the maximum ratios as defined in the zoning code.\nSpeaker 10: It's going to be a combination of facilities and it's really going to emphasize shared parking to the greatest degree possible. Unbundled parking?\nSpeaker 0: Yes, Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 6: I'm sorry to keep your train of thought, but I. So I was reading exhibit five, the Alameda Point Transportation Demand Management Plan. And on page 36, there is there's a paragraph that says, bottom of page 36, the amount of public parking the city provides will be dependent on the choices development makes regarding onsite parking.\nSpeaker 6: For example, if it one extreme development leans toward as little private parking as possible, the city will need to make up the difference and provide more public parking than anticipated, increasing the amount of land required for public parking, as well as increasing the cost to construct public parking.\nSpeaker 6: My question is, is is the city responsible in some way at some point for constructing public parking structures?\nSpeaker 10: I would defer to the staff on the exact intent. You know, we didn't write the DA.\nSpeaker 6: I never. So the so and I will hasten to say that there's a table on page 48 of this document that says that it would be funded by parking. That parking structure, if I'm reading this right, would be funded by parking revenues.\nSpeaker 6: But the cost to construct those parking structures was in excess of $19 million, which I said is a lot of parking revenues. So, Miss, I'd enlighten us, please.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sure. So the way there we have it structure now and the team plan is that the transportation management Assoc because parking I mean I think this is Phil is talking about is there's the carrot and the stick carrot is really that fast convenient transit service the stick being the parking management.\nSpeaker 2: You have to have both to make sure that you're meeting your trip goals that people are using transit. And so the way that we structured the TDM and the zoning code was to make sure that because the more parking you put into private the controlled and owned land, the less control you have over it in terms of\nSpeaker 2: pricing or supply. And so we wanted to have these shared parking areas that were essentially just start with a parking lot. There's no real cost effective standpoint to build a parking structure when you don't know that the demand.\nSpeaker 2: Right.\nSpeaker 6: In the early phases, we're just talking.\nSpeaker 2: About surface.\nSpeaker 6: Parking lots and.\nSpeaker 2: What really happens when if there's sufficient demand. The assumption is that if there's sufficient demand and you're at you're you're you're raising the prices for those public lots because there's so much demand in there full 85 to 90 or 100% of the time, you're going to get revenue from that that you're going to be able to use\nSpeaker 2: to help essentially create a bond or to finance a parking structure. And so that's the thought behind that. And that that those that would come later when that demand was there and when it was appropriate. But you wouldn't make that investment until that time to get it.\nSpeaker 2: Your question, the Transportation Management Association would essentially be making recommendations, working with the city to determine when's the best time to be raising the rates in those shared parking lots. When is the best time to be making recommendations regarding a parking structure because they're so important that parking piece is so important to the overall achievement of these\nSpeaker 2: goals, to have the TMA meeting making recommendations to the city on how to manage that, how to deal with it. And so that's the thought was that answer your question.\nSpeaker 6: It does. Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: So as I'll talk about unbundling, so unbundled parking is a requirement for the site. It's required for multi-unit residential. This does not include the townhomes. We strongly recommend that the unbundling be done on a month to month leasing basis.\nSpeaker 10: Leasing in this way provides the maximum flexibility to effectively manage the program, both from the property owner perspective and from the leases perspective. Affordable units would would have the equal opportunity to lease lease these spaces. That's that's part of the specific plan.\nSpeaker 10: It's like very likely that some of the affordable units will be exempt from this requirement. And that's that's related to how they're financed and some restrictions around financing mechanisms for affordable units.\nSpeaker 0: So can you clarify when they're exempt? Does that mean that they would have bundled parking?\nSpeaker 10: Yes. They would not be required to meet to unbundle their parking.\nSpeaker 0: And the required for the multi-unit residential. Can you clarify what that is about? The apartments? What is a.\nSpeaker 10: That is, I believe. Yes. No, that's.\nSpeaker 0: Not townhomes.\nSpeaker 10: Right? It does not include the townhomes then.\nSpeaker 0: It's not apartments.\nSpeaker 10: Apartments and condos and condos.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you, Mayor Brody.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Madam Mayor. So the affordable units having equal opportunity to lease to the low and very low likely to be exempt. Will other below market rate have the same parking charge or would that be.\nSpeaker 10: It's it's typically done it would be done at a proportional price based on their unit. Okay.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And how many spaces would there be offered per unit? If it's multi-unit.\nSpeaker 10: You know, I believe the the final the final numbers are still being worked out. But it would. You guys want to clarify exactly this. The ratio per unit, it's getting just 1.5.\nSpeaker 0: So I'd like to speak to just my understanding there's one. The tall building will be all rentals. That's apartments, right? Correct. That's right. So for that in the phase one. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 7: What? In the phase one. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. In the phase one, it's it's illustrated as a tall white building scribe. Is that fairly? And how many units, how many rentals would be in that building there?\nSpeaker 7: In the parcel 11, the one closest to the plaza area, there's about 220 units based on the initial plan.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then how many parking spaces do you anticipate for that? For those 220 rentals.\nSpeaker 7: Probably, you know, 220 units. You know what, we looking at the apartments on roughly a one per unit ratio.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: So it's not just about the supply, as Jennifer was alluding to. It's it's really important about how you manage that parking and really want to think about a comprehensive management system for the district as a whole. So these are some of the there's a lot of tools at the city's disposal exactly what that management plan is.\nSpeaker 10: I don't I can't say it yet. It's really going to depend on on how the site develops, what we see in terms of occupancies, it's really going to get down to the details, but it could include any and all of these or a combination of all these strategies.\nSpeaker 10: And so it's there's a lot of tools and ways in which we're managing parking in that. And the key goal is to manage parking to make it as convenient as possible for visitors, for residents and employees. Of course, the final piece is the monitoring program.\nSpeaker 10: This is essential to program success. If you don't know how things are going, it's impossible to say. It's a it's a it's a success or whether you're meeting your targets. So once again, the team plan is a living document.\nSpeaker 10: And if you're not adjusting, it's not going to work. So there's, you know, kind of five, five steps to the monitoring program. It's it's going to be based on data. We're going to every year, they'll go out and collect do traffic counts, do parking counts, do surveys of employees and residents to gauge the participation in the programs\nSpeaker 10: and also see qualitatively how programs are being perceived and how they're working or not working. And then you're going to be reporting and refining the strategies based on based on that data, whether you're meeting the targets, whether you're exceeding the targets, you know, how you're doing in terms of the overall metrics of the site.\nSpeaker 10: It's hard to say exactly what those mitigations might be. It's really going to depend on what we're seeing from the data and how those how the the site as a whole is developing and how meetup point as a whole is developing.\nSpeaker 10: But it could include any number of strategies and those are outlined in the in the compliance strategy. And I'm going to stop there.\nSpeaker 5: And Vice Mayor on that.\nSpeaker 9: On that analysis, on this this grid here of work, who does this work? Is it employees of the TMA or employees of the city?\nSpeaker 10: It it's to be determined. I mean, it could be it.\nSpeaker 9: Pays for who pays.\nSpeaker 10: For this work. This would be as part of this would be funded as part of the team overall team program. So it would be funded via the the assessments on the units. It would be funded via potentially the parking revenue, via via all the different financing strategies that would fund the overall TDM strategy.\nSpeaker 9: Will there be general fund money that. Those who paid for this.\nSpeaker 10: That's my understanding.\nSpeaker 8: And then one more question. So this time and this is going to be a day one phase zero type. It can be implemented then or is we're going to have to wait till there's more more units out there or how's that going to work?\nSpeaker 2: So we just answered no. The answer.\nSpeaker 8: To the.\nSpeaker 2: Vice mayor matter is that no, the general fund will not be responsible for paying for this. We have budgets. We have we have detailed budgets. And I'm a point team plan that showed how much we estimated parking revenues, we estimated the cost of all these things and compared them.\nSpeaker 2: And then now we're doing the same thing with sight to look at all the costs of the services that they're going to be provided, some of them from day one. And Phil can answer that question more specifically. And then we're actually comparing special tax revenue or fee revenue from the development versus what we think those costs are\nSpeaker 2: going to be over time to make sure and it may be in certain years. And I think it's assumed that the developer may have to supplement that until you get enough development to support those day one strategies. And so that we will have more detail as as Mr. Owens said about the funding, the costs and the funding\nSpeaker 2: . But there will at no point will the General Fund be responsible for paying for anything.\nSpeaker 9: And just kind of flipping back and forth from the 16th. Our budget meeting and the 29th, our next budget meeting, will these be city employees who are doing this? So will these revenues keep pace with the PERS burden that those employees carry?\nSpeaker 9: Is that being worked?\nSpeaker 2: And so what we what the team plan says and some of this and right now what we have is a grant with $150,000 grant that we got from MTC to actually hire experts. The woman who set up the Mary Emery go round and Emeryville is actually acting as an expert along with another transportation firm, Fair Peers, and\nSpeaker 2: they're actually helping us set up the team to get all these things figured out in place, not just for this project, but for all. Allow me to point make sure we have our policies are procedures ultimately so but so for right now though staff is working with that money and we're kind of working with them because it\nSpeaker 2: may not make sense right from day one to create a TMA without any development and have bylaws of some organization. Ultimately, there will be an organization, will be an independent organization and have bylaws and and it will have its own staff that will be the transportation coordinator, presumably would.\nSpeaker 8: Would be would work.\nSpeaker 2: For would be part of that TMA and so it would be a separate organization. In the beginning we've got to be a little flexible again as because we're trying we have this grant right now to pay for it, but over those next three years, we'll see it.\nSpeaker 2: Will city staff be playing some role for a period of time? Yes, but over time it's going to transition to an independent organization to run that. We don't anticipate hiring any new staff to help us with this effort.\nSpeaker 2: We're trying to use this MTC grant now and then. We're hoping when there's enough revenue to support the budget and the developments going forward that you'll have the transportation coordinator that they're funding through their fees that then takes over that role and those issues so that we'll have a plan for kind of phasing out of this grant\nSpeaker 2: to to staff funded through the TMA. We're going to have to be a little flexible about that because the timing may not be perfect, and we're going to have to work that out to see how fast this goes, how it all works out.\nSpeaker 2: And so we're just trying to be nimble. So I'm going to let Phil answer your question about the day. I mean, the day one.\nSpeaker 3: Sorry. Could you repeat.\nSpeaker 10: It?\nSpeaker 8: First time apologize for vice mayor was I was not sure that your question answered. So I didn't mean to step on your toes and interrupt. Apologize. It was. Is this team going to be in place in day one, phase zero, or is this something you're going to roll out as we get more units?\nSpeaker 10: I think the expectation that a large that that a large portion of this program would be in place on day one. So certainly the shuttle service would be there on day one. You know, the scale of each of the programs and exactly how it's implemented, depending on the tenant mix and number of employees you have, you know\nSpeaker 10: , there's a lot of variation within each of the within each of these different strategies. So to say what exactly of the of of any number of the strategies is, is there on day one? It's a little hard to pinpoint, but certainly the infrastructure, the framework for the program and the ability for the TMA and the different staff\nSpeaker 10: to immediately liaise with the residents and with the employees is going to be there on day one.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: Now. That was all I had. Unless I'm open for unavailable for questions as much as you like.\nSpeaker 0: Are there other speakers? Here. Does that complete the presentation? All right. So, Counsel, did you want to ask questions on the speaker before we move on? All right. We'll continue with our next speaker, Mr. Ernst.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening. So, Mayor Spencer, members of the council, I'm Joe Ernst with Alameda Point Partners. Glad to have the opportunity to. That's it. Yep. Glad to have the opportunity tonight to talk to you about our commercial and retail strategy.\nSpeaker 7: You'll hear from both me on the commercial side and Pam White with Madison Marquette. You know, as we developed our strategy for this project, again, we focused heavily on the mixed use, both, you know, from the precise plan.\nSpeaker 7: And, you know, as a result of our own experience, we focused heavily on what's there, you know, and what would be a logical next step. You know, what's happening in Alameda Point today, both the scale and compatibility with the side project, the market, what's happening outside of Alameda in our East Bay and San Francisco markets, you know\nSpeaker 7: , we're very active in our local markets. So we have a good take on on what's happening there. But we really believe that the retail and the commercial is going to go a long way, if not, you know, be the lead here role take the lead role in defining the place, defining the culture at site A and the\nSpeaker 7: strategy here in you know, our opinion is it's as important about jobs and services and amenities, etc. as it is about creating those same services and amenities that will support business growth elsewhere at the base. You know, at this early stage, I'm going to spend a little more time talking about kind of the the foundation for the\nSpeaker 7: strategy, the what's behind it, as opposed to, you know, specific companies and uses. You know, the core of the strategy across these many different uses is really going to be, you know, what we've talked about in the past, the, you know, the creativity, the maker, you know, specialty manufacturing, you know, even, you know, think about entrepreneurship, you\nSpeaker 7: know, and entrepreneurship really as a job creation strategy. There'll be art, design, engineering, the retail is going to be destination. It's going to be neighborhood. It's it's not formula. On this slide, this here shows the locations of the various commercial uses.\nSpeaker 7: The red the pink that you see are primarily our retail uses focused around kind of the critical mass, the central core of the project. You can see that in phase two. We we have plans for a hotel. We've already seen a lot of interest.\nSpeaker 7: And we think as the project grows and develops, that that interest will continue to increase. We've certainly heard from a lot of businesses at the point that they would like to see a hotel. And then, of course, up on Tower Avenue in the existing buildings, 117 118 this will be our creator maker hub, the production area.\nSpeaker 7: You know, these, you know, again, as we talked, you know, these are going to be, you know, I think a very high value add. You know, we're going to have our retail and our commercial strategies are going to be very closely aligned.\nSpeaker 7: You know, there'll be jobs and sales, you know, occurring in the same facilities. These will be local, but also Internet sales here located in this. And the focus here will be a broader job base. You know, we think it's going to be better at creating a sustainable, durable jobs base by focusing on companies that say ten companies\nSpeaker 7: with ten employees versus the one company with 100 employees. You know, again, what's really motivating changes in the market and how we think about workforce, workplace business, places of business is, you know, this new generation workplace district and this has really become the basis of what we've seen in many precise plans.\nSpeaker 7: Our neighbor, San Leandro commissioned a large study on this and has really focused a lot of their recruitment strategy around this. But the nature of it is a very tight mixed use where, you know, each of these three functions you see on the screen are really dependent on one another.\nSpeaker 7: And we saw this in Oakland, too, and how the downtown in the uptown area is really taking hold. You know, the housing came in and brought people that led to amenities, services and transit. And now as a result of that, you know, jobs are really coming into the area and good jobs, good quality jobs.\nSpeaker 7: So, again, you know, the workforce that the workplace district today is really and what facilities decision makers are looking for are very mixed use communities. And so that really is fine. You know, a part of the basis of our strategy, you know, this it's a little dark this here really, you know, I don't think any of this\nSpeaker 7: is necessarily earth shattering, but I think it's all things we have to think of as a whole and how. Things have changed, you know, from the late 20th century to now as we think about, you know, the economic development strategy for both city and for Alameda Point, you know, in the late, you know, in the in the\nSpeaker 7: eighties nineties, you know, we were still focused on mass production, low cost, and that is clearly moved to more to specialty production. Economic development strategies were really focused on attracting big, vertically integrated companies. But I think what's really important and what we're seeing clearly a lot of today, particular in the Bay Area, is the building of business\nSpeaker 7: ecosystems, you know, supply chains, spaces that truly promote collaboration, networked clusters. And, you know, one of my experiences when we did the Pixar campus way back when, you know, Steve Jobs was very visionary on this and he was really about collaboration and for end creating spaces that forced collaboration.\nSpeaker 7: And that place was set up to force people to get out of their offices, force people to get together and run together. And and that's really what we're seeing, you know, now in the workplace, suburban commuting, you know, this goes to the heart of some of our traffic issues with CBD, central business district, you know, outside of\nSpeaker 7: the central business district, you know, downtowns, you know, we've seen, you know, traditionally, you know, the big separation of workplaces and living spaces. And now we're seeing much more of that come together. Mixed uses, complete communities. And traditionally, you know, buildings and real estate, you know, places for machines about infrastructure.\nSpeaker 7: And now places are really being designed. The communities, again, the amenities, you know, for engagement, for emphasis on traction of people. Just a few notes here. You know, again, you know, the makers, you know, this can be across many different companies, you know, metals, food and beverage.\nSpeaker 7: Clearly, I think a strong opportunity for us at the point energy, you know, with some of the companies. Again, we have at the point in Alameda Municipal Power Apparel, Wood Craft, 3D printing design, engineering companies. But, you know, these all are not necessarily technology companies, but technology has made this work environment what it is.\nSpeaker 7: These will be smaller companies, you know, with a variety of shared spaces, shared resources, tenant spaces ranging from 500 to up, you know, on up to 10,000 square feet. You know, and then, you know, some of our local inspiration for this, you know, these are things right in our own market.\nSpeaker 7: Very, you know, strong job generators, cradle to scale, you know, the American Industrial Center in Dogpatch in San Francisco. It's just a wide variety of small companies and spinning off a lot of great jobs. The active space program where, you know, can at least makerspace San Leandro has created the gate, you know, again, for a wide variety\nSpeaker 7: of uses, you know, Oakland makers, tech shop, which spawned, you know, a national focus on R&D. And again, this is a big part of the movement. And I think just lastly, you know, I think you're going to hear this, too, from Pam and Madison.\nSpeaker 7: Marquette, you know, how to execute this strategy, I think, is really, you know, having a clear vision. This is about environment. This is not just offering real estate. This is creating an environment. It's it's offering services. It's marketing the program and not just the space.\nSpeaker 7: It's and it's not, you know, just hiring a broker and putting up a sign. It's very active ownership. It's local relationships, which this team clearly has. And it's, again, discipline and execution for this plan to be successful. But I think this will, again, create a good foundation for job creation at Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 7: And so with that, I'd like to hand it over to Pam White to talk about our retail strategy.\nSpeaker 2: First time here. So you have to excuse me if I'm. Which one's.\nSpeaker 5: Oh. There you go.\nSpeaker 2: Madam Mayor, members of the city council, thank you for taking this late hour to hear this. I'll try to be brief, but Joe asked me to take out a few slides. But it was so it was so important to me to make sure I got everything in here.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to use a few words, but I'd like you to really pay attention to the images here, because I think that there's a story that I'm trying to tell here as I sat and thought about what are the words that come to my mind with Alameda Point, I came up with these five that are really\nSpeaker 2: important to me first as often to a city. It's a very authentic space. It feels very real to a lot of folks who have been there for many, many years. It's got great fabric. There is a tremendous sense of pride.\nSpeaker 2: That's both at Alameda Point and within the city itself. There's a tremendous history and yet there's great opportunity that that we can all hope to have happen here. The first few slides are some of the images of the buildings that we've already seen.\nSpeaker 2: You know, it's I came across the same bit of the same images of building 67 that that David you so it's kind of interesting how we're telling the same theme here but these are all existing images of the buildings that we intend to use in phase one.\nSpeaker 2: Tremendous interiors. They've got, you know, a lot of interest. And this is building 113. That's, of course, on the A Lagoon. They don't want. Take a little step back and talk a little bit about history of a couple of other projects in the Bay Area.\nSpeaker 2: I don't know. I'm sure you're all familiar with Fourth Street in Berkeley. It was fallow land and a bunch of empty buildings back in 1976 when the city of Berkeley started working on this area. And in 1976, Dennis Abrams and his partners began to work here in a craftsman homebuilding industry.\nSpeaker 2: With. With. Businesses that supported the home building. But one of the things that they built was the Four Street Grill. I remember that when I moved here was established. I moved here in 81 and I was one of the first places that we went to.\nSpeaker 2: So you look at these old images that were from that time period and look at where it came to where it is today with a tremendous range of national and local businesses that's continued to thrive over the years.\nSpeaker 2: So again, this is probably about 200,000 square feet of retail now, but it's just continued to organically evolve. And I think it starts with the vision that didn't Denny Abrams started years ago. And these are just images from a project that's continuing to evolve in Sebastopol called the Barolo.\nSpeaker 2: But I think the images are important because it's got this industrial sort of organic feel to it, I think. Again, these are things that we want to establish at Alameda Point. But I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about a project that we're have completed in Los Angeles.\nSpeaker 2: It's called a La Brea. Yes, I know. Is Los Angeles less? I know it's not Alameda. But I think, you know, the story here is there's a consistent story here to tell. We these are all existing images of the buildings that we bought, which is, again, about 100,000 square feet.\nSpeaker 2: We bought these in 2008, which is not the most opportune time to start a, you know, a retail development. But here here we go. And I want you to pay particular attention to the image in the lower left hand corner, because I'll point that out to you in a minute.\nSpeaker 2: So this was what we bought in 2008. These are some of the existing images of the buildings that we bought at that time. So now I want to talk about our approach, which I think is really key. The first thing that we do with any project is we have to come up with a vision.\nSpeaker 2: And this was actually the vision statement that was crafted 2009 or 2010, but it was established very early on, I think, and this is something that we've adhered to throughout the process. You'll see the rate of collection, the evolution cohere at destination.\nSpeaker 2: But this in this does not take one month to come up with this. This can take six months. This can take a year. But there's a lot of research and emotion that sort of goes into this. Next we establish the branding.\nSpeaker 2: And in this case, the words that we used were contemporary, understated, bespoke, which is craftsman built on heritage, eclectic and oblique. Next. There has to be a commitment and to properly attract the businesses, they have to understand and believe that you are going to follow through with your vision and your brand.\nSpeaker 2: If you don't do that, they won't believe it and they will not listen to you, you know, not commit to you at the same time. So, again, you see what we started with in 2008, and these are actual images of what's of what's occurred over time.\nSpeaker 2: The next piece is activation. Obviously in 2008 and nine, we didn't have a lot of you know, there was not a lease, a lot of leasing to be done. So we had to think about activation. We staged events.\nSpeaker 2: We engaged the arts, we engaged low local artists to paint a simple thing as a barricade. So the barricade became interesting for all the years that the buildings were under construction or renovation. In this case, we you know, Shepard Fairey was engaged to work on the corner mural.\nSpeaker 2: And that mural is still there today because we liked it so much. We started with pop ups. You know, there are some tenants who are still in the in the spaces right now that have been there since the early days.\nSpeaker 2: We'd like to move them to more permanent tenants, but pop ups were very important at that time. We engaged social media because we wanted to create a buzz and get people going to this new district. Public relations, we engage part of relations to, again, make this an attractive space.\nSpeaker 2: Lastly, we come to leasing. And so everyone always says to me, Who are you going to lease to? But leasing is it's really the last step of the process, as hard as that is for some folks, you know, for some people to understand.\nSpeaker 2: So these are images of Libya as that exist today. And the picture up in the upper left corner. That is the image that I said. Do you pay attention to that little courtyard that has become the Sycamore Kitchen, which is, you know, extremely, very vibrant restaurant.\nSpeaker 2: And these are all images from La Brea. I didn't pull in things from other projects. We also have creative office space here on the upper level. So vision, branding, commitment, activation and leasing. You know, you if we have found that if we follow these steps and generally we like to follow them in this order, though sometimes we\nSpeaker 2: get. I'm working on a project now that the branding is a little ahead of the vision, but, you know, we'll get it back in line again. And lastly, I love these images because this talks about opportunity. Now, this is this is not Alameda, but that these are this is actually in Seattle.\nSpeaker 2: But I think it will show to you what this what this area can be. And I just love these images. So I wanted to make sure I shared them. And that's so I think you can sort of see how this process falls.\nSpeaker 2: So many questions, but. Great. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. But we do have this at the end of the presentation.\nSpeaker 2: At the end of the presentation. All right.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmembers, do you have any questions? You have six.\nSpeaker 5: Figures.\nSpeaker 0: All right. I'm going to proceed with calling the speakers Leslie Cameron, Catherine Pauling and then Carey Thompson. And if you'd like to speak on this, please turn in your slips.\nSpeaker 5: Hello, Mayor, Vice Mayor, council members and staff. My name is Leslie Cameron and I'm co-owner of Bay Shipping Yacht Company. This month we're celebrating 21 years in Alameda. Our business is a full service shipyard. Repairs built and refurbishes commercial military vessels, superyachts and historical watercraft.\nSpeaker 5: I'm also on the board of directors for the Alameda Chamber of Commerce and the working waterfront cohort. When we first arrived in Alameda, Vice Mayor Matarese was a champion for holding town hall meetings to educate folks about the Tidelands lease issues.\nSpeaker 5: Since then, we did negotiate a lease that will allow us to operate here for 66 years. And as you may know, we also recently purchased the Alameda Gateway property where Rosenbloom used to be. We are landlords now, too.\nSpeaker 5: We employ about 350 to 400 employees here in Alameda, but yet only about 10% of them actually live here on the island. It's hard for them to find affordable housing. Actually, I think they all would wish to live and work here if they could.\nSpeaker 5: We are also a green employer. Our employees are issued bikes and many bike to work. We invest in the state of the art systems for our shipyard and we've been the recipient of many government grants. With more in the works.\nSpeaker 5: I personally reviewed the plan for the redevelopment site A and I think this plan is very cool and needed since it's been eight years since the Navy left. I don't live at an island on the island, so I don't always get involved in some of these topics.\nSpeaker 5: But this issue actually really moves me and I do spend a lot of time here in Alameda. And objectively speaking, I believe this is a great plan and I'll tell you why. BAY Shipping needs affordable housing for all the folks we put here to work.\nSpeaker 5: They need to be able to walk and bike to work. It's good exercise. It's good city planning, and it makes sense. And it's what this generation is doing. Site is designed for this generation. My son Max is pushing 20 and he actually thinks that driving a car is not cool.\nSpeaker 5: The plan is designed to cut down on traffic by offering transit alternatives like shuttles and bus passes, carpooling, car sharing. And this developer will put in a new ferry terminal, which we really need. And also, maybe most importantly, this for the safety and sustainability of Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 5: The developer will put in a water main. And frankly, the status quo is is a little bit scary for us. They will also improve all the other infrastructures like utilities, communications, sewer, etc.. And I'll just end here by saying we have hundreds of people that come to visit as customers.\nSpeaker 5: And if we made it easy for them, I'm sure they would love to spend their money here in Alameda, the amenities, the retail shops, the dining and the hotel. We all use our customers and our hundreds of employees.\nSpeaker 5: Let's have them spend our their money in Alameda. I believe that this project is the time is now. And as the largest employer at Alameda Point, I want to improve the safety of the site and explore its untapped potential.\nSpeaker 5: I urge this Council to do the right thing. Some of US citizens and staff that have been building this for a very, very long time and we did a tremendous amount of community input already. I urge you to adopt, develop, to develop this this plan with this developer and let's refine it together.\nSpeaker 5: Allow Alameda to set the stage for the 21st century green city planning as a model for the whole Bay Area. We have an opportunity to do something really great here. Please let us help it to be safe and to move forward.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Kathryn Pauling and then Kari Thompson.\nSpeaker 2: Though not a mayor council staff. I'm I'm nervous. I'm Catherine Pawling. I'm a renter here in Alameda. Eight years ago, I became legal guardian of my grandchildren. I was in the Richmond Marina with a wonderful waterfront view and a much, much cheaper rent.\nSpeaker 2: But I came here for the community, for the schools, for everything that's wonderful. And the children recognize Alameda as home. It's developments like this with a very large share of affordable housing. That gives me a bit of hope, because right now, even though as renters, we are half the city, we live in constant fear.\nSpeaker 2: Rents have gone up 50% in just the last two years, although my landlord has been reasonable. Just last week, when I asked for reimbursement for a plumbing expense, she pointed out she could charge a thousand more for a three bedroom apartment.\nSpeaker 2: And she's right. But a 30 day notice for that kind of rent increase would basically be an eviction. There is simply no way I could do that. Also, I'm Mr. Daza. I would like to personally thank you for being a numbers wonk.\nSpeaker 0: And.\nSpeaker 2: Actually going and mining the census data on the city of Alameda. The fact that.\nSpeaker 1: Property owners.\nSpeaker 2: Had their incomes increase, but renters and Alameda have lost income. I retired this year, so that has been definitely an adjustment is a reality that this is something which impacts half of your half of your people. And we look to you for these kinds of developments in this kind of consciousness of having affordable housing continue to be\nSpeaker 2: a piece of it. There are opportunities with converting industrial sites and the base to be able to have these pieces and solve the transportation and the all the attendant issues. But we rely on it as a renter here.\nSpeaker 2: It's like living in the Wild West. Not only are there dramatic rent increases, but they're tagging on new. A friend is having a water charge, added. She's going to be billed $60 a month, even though she has no garden to water, no washing machine or personal dryer.\nSpeaker 2: It's really going unchecked. And I know you're doing data collection on these issues. I want to support this project. I want you to look closely and wherever you can, please, please add affordable housing components for low income and low medium the various the various levels.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Carrie Thompson and then Christopher Seewald.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening.\nSpeaker 2: Everyone. Thank you so much. My name is Kerry Thompson. I am also with the Chamber of Commerce. I'm also a lifelong resident here in Alameda and work here. And I'm fortunate that I do have to commute. I'm sorry I have to go across a bridge.\nSpeaker 2: I have to go across the Bay Farm Bridge.\nSpeaker 5: But I do kind of have to commute.\nSpeaker 2: But if I could, I really would bike. But first of all, I want to thank the city council and the staff for your efforts to make sure that this project is a really great project. Because, you know, every time you guys make a comment, I notice that this team takes it to heart and they really try very\nSpeaker 2: hard to incorporate whatever comments come. Whether or not I might think it may be not reasonable. They really do listen and try to their best to work with everyone and I really appreciate that about them. This project is laying a really good foundation for further development.\nSpeaker 2: Alameda Point Site A is to me a cornerstone of the future actually of Alameda as far as economic development, affordable housing and jobs. I mean, this project is bringing jobs to Alameda. And as we know, commercial developers are not willing to provide the infrastructure needed for other projects without city funding.\nSpeaker 2: So this project is laying that infrastructure at their own cost without touching the city funds, which is just amazing to me. And I think it also provides a boost to future site development at Alameda Point, which we all know is necessary.\nSpeaker 2: It's going to happen. It needs to happen. And I really again, I appreciate the willingness of the Alameda Point Partners team to listen and incorporate the con the comments into the the project. And it shows their commitment to Alameda and their willingness to make this an outstanding project.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Christopher. And then Michael McDonagh. And then Helen's off.\nSpeaker 8: Mayor Council staff. My name is Christopher Seewald. I'm a Alameddine of 26 years. Barely long enough to savor sales either. I'm also a business owner.\nSpeaker 9: Here in Alameda. I employ people here. I'm a developer and a somewhat hapless restaurateur. I'm here to.\nSpeaker 8: Review a petition of Alameda business leaders.\nSpeaker 9: Hopefully somewhat dramatically. And we'll get past this.\nSpeaker 8: Dear Mayor and city council. We represent some of the larger employers currently operating in Alameda. One of the many attributes that attracted us to locate on the island is the promise of desirable housing and recreation for our employees.\nSpeaker 8: An attractive environment for jobs. We call upon you to fulfill this promise. Collectively, we employ thousands of people, many of whom commute, commute on and off the island each day. Our employees work hard and play hard and prefer to rent or own in Alameda.\nSpeaker 8: However, the persistent housing shortage, lack of mid-size apartment rentals and rising costs create obstacles.\nSpeaker 9: And present a recruiting and retention.\nSpeaker 8: Challenge for local businesses. The city is presented with a real opportunity to attract quality commercial tenants with plans to redevelop the former naval base. Most employers are no longer looking to fill large office parks and force employee and force employees into long commutes.\nSpeaker 8: Corporate campuses. The site plan will attract commercial businesses in the technology and new economy sectors. But to start up or relocate.\nSpeaker 9: Here and to recruit and retain a durable.\nSpeaker 8: Workforce, they need a community to support them. This includes infrastructure, capital facilities, a collaborative culture and places to live. Plans for two thirds rental housing, workforce housing.\nSpeaker 9: Including a quarter.\nSpeaker 8: Of affordable units, are part of this business ecosystem. Housing employees near their workplaces will also alleviate rush hour traffic in the tube and on our bridges. A new ferry terminal bus, rapid transit and bike path are also part of this network.\nSpeaker 8: Artisan dining and retail parks and recreation complete the community. Without an interconnected system, we cannot grow or sustain jobs. Sight as a catalyst for jobs.\nSpeaker 9: Generation at Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 8: There is a reason Alameda is considered one of the most sought after places to live in the country. It is also one of the best places to work by joining in this public private partnership. Alameda can model the success of other cities have had planned for a thoughtful mix of housing near workspaces, creating a sense of place\nSpeaker 8: for employees seeking to improve their lifestyle by living closer to where they work. This is signed by over 140 people in the last two weeks.\nSpeaker 9: Including Brad Shook of the.\nSpeaker 8: Palladium, Leslie Cameron of Bay, Ship and Yacht, Rob Dowd, Mike Hester and Brooke.\nSpeaker 9: Brockman, Grant of McGuire and Hester. Kate Pryor of Tucker's.\nSpeaker 8: Dennis Pagonis and Rich Creeks of Harbor Bay Realty. Patty Pierce of V.F. Outdoors. Mark Sorensen of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. Doug Biggs of the Alameda Point Collective.\nSpeaker 9: And myself. I'm going to go a little off script here.\nSpeaker 8: And say that just because 140 odd people say something doesn't necessarily make it true. But I would point out that many of these people, most of them both live and work in Alameda.\nSpeaker 9: So they are pretty much walking the walk.\nSpeaker 7: Of.\nSpeaker 8: The talk. They talk and and for my part, the reason that I employ people in Alameda and do redevelopment on Park Street and run somewhat haphazardly, a cafe is not because just because when I was 25, I found a job in Alameda, but because when I was 27, I was able to move here.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Michael McDonagh, then Helen Source.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, madam mayor and the council and staff Michael McDonough from i'm president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. And you know, what I have to say really repeats a lot about what what some of the other people have said.\nSpeaker 10: What I what I also want to say is today I did a speech at Argosy University, which we're proud to call the San Francisco campus of Argosy University.\nSpeaker 3: Is home right here in Alameda. And I told them at that time that Alameda. Is on the verge. Speaking mostly of Alameda Point is on the verge of becoming a a thriving hub of.\nSpeaker 10: Business.\nSpeaker 3: To high tech, to green tech and many other sectors that are looking to relocate to.\nSpeaker 9: Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 3: And we have the opportunity here to develop a thriving business ecosystem.\nSpeaker 10: I loved it that.\nSpeaker 3: Joe had that in his presentation. It's something I've been saying. This ecosystem can attract capital, and we've talked about the creation of jobs, but really raised the standard of living for all Alamitos by accepting this proposal from facility.\nSpeaker 3: But, you know, this is what the city project or this Alameda point really is one of the most desirable pieces of property in the entire Bay Area. But really, we cannot let it fulfill its its potential unless we get the infrastructure required to do so in this site.\nSpeaker 3: A plan will bring that infrastructure to not only attract those businesses and that capital and create those jobs, but to keep the existing companies that are out there and businesses that are out there, for instance, out there at the very end of the point at Monarch Street, they don't have any streetlights.\nSpeaker 3: They really want streetlights out there. But there's no money for that that to happen unless we have a better infrastructure. And this site, a plan is what can provide the infrastructure for, again, not only attracting new businesses, but providing the existing businesses out there with their badly needed facilities as well.\nSpeaker 3: And I went on to talk to the Alameda to the Argosy University people about the fact that this this project, as we'll all benefit from it, we'll all enjoy it. But really, it's being built for another generation. It's being built for the millennials.\nSpeaker 3: And these millennials have grown up with different values than we have. We heard them talk about how the young people don't want to drive cars. They want to ride bikes.\nSpeaker 10: It's so true.\nSpeaker 3: They want to live near where they work. They want to ride their bike to work. They want to ride their bike to school. They want to be able to have activities like the water activities that we'll have at the point right in their own neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 3: They want to make an impact in their own community. They're very technology savvy. They're very environmental savvy. They really want to be around hubs of innovation and and and green energy hubs. You know, Alameda is known for that.\nSpeaker 3: And I just want to urge you to to really take a look at all the benefits we'll get from this project. And in the end, when it comes time for approval to think about the good, because as the president of the Chamber of Commerce.\nSpeaker 10: I can say that this project is not only good for business.\nSpeaker 3: But it's good for Alameda and.\nSpeaker 10: It should be passed.\nSpeaker 0: Here along source and then William Smith.\nSpeaker 2: I really appreciate the comprehensive report we've had tonight. It's been well thought out in all aspects and will certainly jump start Alameda Points Development. This really begins fulfilling the plans and hopes of Olympians that have gone on for over 20 years, which culminated in the Base for use plan adopted in the mid-nineties.\nSpeaker 2: That plan was formed by the community and reflecting goals that came out of dozens of community meetings. We also worked with a talented consultant. So it was based on factual, practical ideas, all of which have evolved in the last 20 years to a new generation that have traded in their car keys for clipper cards.\nSpeaker 2: And that's a good thing. But the plan was envisioned to be a new neighborhood with a mixture of uses reflecting planning, excellence and provided development of homes for all incomes. And to provide jobs, good transit and public amenities.\nSpeaker 2: This plan has it all. It would be also a good economic engine, beneficial from the development itself. And now, after the recent recession, even more important is the rest of the story. This development is a major gift to the social and economic development benefits for decades to come and will benefit Alameda so much.\nSpeaker 2: Over time. I know that night the focus was on the physical, the trance, all of which are critical. But it also necessitates really looking at what a benefit it's going to provide in the years to come. It would be interesting to see how those economical aspects are quantified over time.\nSpeaker 2: All of the jobs, all of the taxes people pay, all the money they spend in shops, all of those things. It would be interesting to quantify that. So again, thanks to the developer and the Council for presenting this excellent educational opportunity for the communion community.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: You. William Smith appears to have left. All right. So next is Laura Thomas and then Ron Silverstein. And that's the last clip I have. If there's any other speakers, please turn on your slips.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. Laura Thomas Renewed Hope. Housing advocates and the other speakers have spoken so, so well about all the reasons why this city plan keeps getting more and more exciting. So I'm probably just going to go into my usual reminder about how important housing is.\nSpeaker 2: It really is an ecosystem. Has Mike McDonough said. And I'm really very excited about the way Joe Lawrence described it as a new generation workplace district, because I think the key thing here is it's something we've never seen before.\nSpeaker 2: And I've always felt like Alameda Point was going to be almeida's chance to show the Bay Area how how innovative we can be. And Joe Lawrence is giving us that chance to do that. I really think it would.\nSpeaker 2: You know, it's it is very contingent on the housing. You know, we've seen commercial industrial research, research, development, parks all over the Bay Area without housing around them. And they're just really pretty gloomy places. They're places where people are cocooned during the day and at night and over the weekend, they become deathly still environments that nobody ever\nSpeaker 2: wants to be near. And I would hate to see I mean, I hate to see Alameda Point turn into that. And so the the 20, you know, it really is a 21st century concept. The 20th century concept, which we've lived in all along, is very dependent on cars and suburbs and separation of uses.\nSpeaker 2: And we're in the 21st century and our children are going to grow up in this century. And they're they're the people we're really doing this for. I think we have to remember getting back to housing. You know. It's going to make the point successful.\nSpeaker 2: We're getting a pretty big chunk of affordable housing and we're getting it because Renewed Hope sued the city back in 2000. That's why it's 25% and not the normal 15%. And developer has not complained. They've stepped right up and said they're going to do it.\nSpeaker 2: All of us, advocates and citizens, have been waiting over a decade for our city leaders to step up and get it done with a reputable developer. The affordable housing will come out of the profit from the market rate housing just like all the other benefits that are going to.\nSpeaker 2: Come out of this development. There's going to be a large number of affordable units, both family and seniors, which will simply not come out of any other sources. I think that's I have to remind you all of that, that the idea that we can build affordable housing out of other other sources is a little imaginary because it's\nSpeaker 2: basically vanquished redevelopment, extremely competitive tax credits, and just maybe a little glimmer of hope of new funding at the state level. So if we truly want this affordable housing, this is this is the moment. So we either get it with Joe EARNEST and this development or I think we kiss it goodbye for a while, at least on\nSpeaker 2: Alameda point. And I'll I'll stop with that. Thank you very much, Ron.\nSpeaker 0: And he's our last speaker, unless anyone else has the slip.\nSpeaker 8: The mayor and city council members and staff. I'm Ron Silberstein. I have the enviable position of being the last one to speak. I won't put anyone to sleep. I just I just want to reiterate my support for the the plan for the city development, as has put forth to you today.\nSpeaker 8: I'm an Alameda resident.\nSpeaker 9: My children go to school here.\nSpeaker 8: I would be I think that Alameda has a really unique opportunity in this particular development. It has all the components as everyone's expressed. I'm not adding anything new, but it's got the critical and very needed housing needs. The transportation is extremely well thought out.\nSpeaker 8: That's a very important element, especially its links to public transportation. I'll be using all the bike lanes, no doubt. The commercial component is super exciting. I have a lot of friends and colleagues who are.\nSpeaker 7: Already out at Alameda.\nSpeaker 8: Point. Some of the businesses there in particular on Spirit Alley. And I know just everyone's super excited about this coming out there. So the the less critical element is the kind of infrastructure this is going to bring out there.\nSpeaker 8: It's just going to allow even more creative and.\nSpeaker 7: Innovative businesses to to be.\nSpeaker 8: Out there. And also a place where I very much would love to open my next business.\nSpeaker 7: So I just encourage everyone to. To support this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All right. No more. No other speaker. Okay. So before 1030, we have two more items after this one, six H and 9 a.m. to consider those, we would need a motion with four affirmative votes. I'll second all those in favor.\nSpeaker 5: I.\nSpeaker 8: No.\nSpeaker 0: I will also vote no then.\nSpeaker 3: Hmm.\nSpeaker 0: So three, two.\nSpeaker 2: Four seats for both states.\nSpeaker 0: But then it fails for lack of a votes.\nSpeaker 6: What if we have?\nSpeaker 8: By 11:00.\nSpeaker 2: So that.\nSpeaker 0: Motion failed. Okay. Let's continue now with Council of Comments.\nSpeaker 6: I'll make a comment. So thank you to all the speakers and presenters. Pam White of Madison Market. I think you get my prize for the evening for. Really? I'm glad you didn't let Jo correct any of your slides, because that was that was really very exciting and innovative, especially the library presentation and also to Phil Olmsted of\nSpeaker 6: Nelson Nygaard. I spent a lot of time reading about the transportation demand management program, the Transportation Management Association. And if I get all those acronyms right and something that struck me in reading through and this was again in exhibit five is so there is a.\nSpeaker 6: A really nice description if anybody wants to go back and read it. Exhibit five on page 29. It talks about what Nike we all know. Nike, you know, just do it the swoosh. And so they're located in Oregon and they have put together a very impressive team plan for their employees in in Oregon and among other things\nSpeaker 6: , and I won't go through all the bullets, but they have introduced an incentive based program giving away prizes and Nike bike vouchers. Get it? The Nike cafeteria, Nike's stores, they had an onsite employer transportation coordinator. Nike helps subsidize the cost of annual bus rail passes, promoted carpooling through the use of an in-house rideshare.\nSpeaker 6: All Passholders were eligible for the Guaranteed Ride Home program that we'd be looking at here too. Administered by local transit authority, allowed employees flex time so they could come to work at different times, not necessarily clog the transportation infrastructure only at rush hour.\nSpeaker 6: Bicycle commuters had lots of amenities, access to Nike's to fitness centers, use of showers and the locker room. I could go on, but the thing that you really should know about this is they did this in 1996 in response to the state of Oregon.\nSpeaker 6: Department of Environmental Quality is establishment of a commute trip reduction mandate aimed at employers. So we're not exactly on the cutting edge. But that said, this is and I think it was brought out earlier, this is the the first major comprehensive team plan to be implemented in Alameda.\nSpeaker 6: If obviously, if we go forward with with the plans for site A and that just goes to the point brought out on page 53 that the plan does need to be flexible because again, this is a case of first impression for you lawyers in the room that in the initial phases of development at Alameda Point, it says\nSpeaker 6: on page 53, the characteristics of the employers, the employees and residents attracted to Alameda Point are not yet fully understood yet and not fully understood yet. So the TMA services and programs may not precisely match the needs of new employees and residents, and therefore there will need to be this and this flexibility.\nSpeaker 6: And and I think, you know, those are all things that we can really aspire to. And just lastly, I also liked the fact that on the last page it page 82 of 82 pages of this particular exhibit was a great list of examples of residential specific transportation demand strategies.\nSpeaker 6: So we think a lot about getting employees out of their cars and getting to getting to their work using public transit. But there's also ways that can be built into a new development like Friday, where you can actually get residents out of their cars for those mid-day trips, in weekend trips and getting the kids to school.\nSpeaker 6: And there's a whole list of strategies here. And I just come in command everyone's city staff. Jennifer, you've done an awesome job and we've been able we've been very fortunate to have some good grant money to help us get the plans in place.\nSpeaker 6: And so thank you for keeping us so well informed along the way and look forward to doing more together. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Speaker.\nSpeaker 0: Member. I remember the.\nSpeaker 7: Raid. Well, thank you very much. Let me just start off with a comment that I pieced together in light of the comments raised tonight by the residents and by the present presenters. If they are if the breathtaking views of San Francisco, the fact of Spirit's Alley and Antiques by the Bay suggest anything.\nSpeaker 7: It's that there is a budding funky coldness to Alameda point. And everything that Joe Ernst and Pam White and the Alameda Partners team members said tonight. With their emphasis on craft artisanal economy. Everything that they said tonight burnishes that funky coolness even more.\nSpeaker 7: As a chamber president. Mike McDougal said, this project is being built for the millennials and I might add, the male, the millennial minded as well. But even more, the ideas discussed tonight by all of Alameda partner team members need to be understood against the backdrop of the Great Recession.\nSpeaker 7: Which revealed in tragic ways the economically and socially unsustainable, sustainable ways of Wall Street, with its emphasis on suburban style communities, oversupply of national chain, real retail, as well as oversupply of office parks going long vacant. So with pass delay, with the ideas that you saw tonight.\nSpeaker 7: I believe we're designing a site a primarily is a human scale and not necessarily though obviously we'll need we'll need them not necessarily to Wall Street investors in mind. I think the great thing about what we saw, not just tonight, but over the course of the past several weeks and months, was this incredible progression.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, starting many, many years ago when you looked at plans put forward by. AP ZB in the early 2000, subsequently by Roma Design in 2005, and then subsequently by son Karl. You really saw kind of your typical suburban type of product with this emphasis on single family homes, with this emphasis on.\nSpeaker 7: Demolishing sites as opposed to reusing sites with an emphasis on kind of a business park. And I think, you know, where things started to turn. I think let's not forget, was that the city of Alameda staff began kind of the next steps forward.\nSpeaker 7: I remember back in 2010 or so when they began kind of had this discussion about. And a more sustainable ways of looking at Alameda Point. And then pushing that even further. We had the swim plan, which the hallmark to me, the hallmark of the SOCOM plan was kind of providing the broad contours vision for Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 7: Again, kind of emphasizing on reusing, emphasizing on finding ways to create a sole for the place. And I think with the work of Alameda Partners tonight, I think they really fleshed out the details that was revealed and they saw when plan and in ways that I think a lot of us will be proud.\nSpeaker 7: With this emphasis on, you know, the type of housing that that is aligned with the needs of businesses here. And more importantly, aligned with potentially the needs not just of the workers, but with the community struggling with our housing supply issues.\nSpeaker 7: And I think for me, the biggest takeaway maybe I don't want to overemphasize this, but, you know, to see that bullet point that says that we're going to have a 15 minute headway. Now, I know many maybe think not many people are thinking, who cares?\nSpeaker 7: 15 minute shuttle headway. Well, to me, that says that's a lot, because, you know, the other projects that we've seen, you know, they're coming in with a shuttle coming by once every 30 minutes. It might work if you're there when that once every 30 minute shuttle comes.\nSpeaker 7: But now, if we within our agreement, if we have a shuttle agreement that says once every 15 minutes. To the extent that it proves itself. I think that the possibility of going to once every 10 minutes is strong without overstating the case.\nSpeaker 7: But at least we're starting with something that's more that that's possible. So so I really appreciate seeing that because to me. We've taken a concept channel and now we've put in an implementation aspect to it a shuttle that goes once every 15 minutes.\nSpeaker 7: So I think that I know we were warned not to focus on one thing. I just did. There will be other things that we still need to discuss, though, within the context of the shuttle. I mean, for example, one of the things that's indicated is that in the supplemental report, Exhibit five supplemental, there's reference to that the\nSpeaker 7: shuttle would only operate within Alameda Point. We need to talk about that and. No. But I think you know what we have. There's a lot to work with. And really taking us in the right direction. And I do want to second what former chamber president Harry Thompson said, that this was a process, this was kind of an\nSpeaker 7: iterative process where we raised concerns and then the developers then came back and said, okay, well, let's try to meet these concerns. Now, I think what we next steps really is to flesh out the business detail and part of this.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, there will be a substantial part investment on the part of Alameda. But I think when you look at the project itself and its impacts, I think we've got a lot to believe that the returns from the project itself warrant, you know, at least a first hurdle saying, okay, this, this, this, this looks good.\nSpeaker 7: But then the other types of returns that we might think about in terms of like whatever community facilities where we were interested in in those, too. I mean, there's some positive things out that that that might come out.\nSpeaker 7: You know, the details will come out in that when we start discussing the DDA for sure. But. And I like what I heard tonight. You know, I think, you know, the concerns that I raised about, well, proximity to the water, you know, the building 13.\nSpeaker 7: Well, they flush that out so we can physically see. Okay, I get it. I understand there are still other points that that we will need to work out. Like I said, like the the shuttle, how much how often does it stop outside of Alameda point?\nSpeaker 7: I mean, maybe there are good reasons for it not to. I understand that there and there was one or two or three other things, but I'll have to send that via email. I just can't find it in my notes right now.\nSpeaker 7: Well, thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Madam Mayor. I just want to thank the folks who came out from the public to speak on this. I think this is is the third meeting we've had. And I still think I haven't heard a speaker from the public speak against this.\nSpeaker 8: So. If you're waiting to the last minute, it'd probably be better to kind of ring your concerns now at these meetings because has you seen the developer is very amenable to listening to the concerns of the community and adapting and adjusting.\nSpeaker 8: And I do want to just say to Tim, is that the work you do on this is amazing. I mean, to get to where we are today, every day the pictures look prettier. So I'll talk about that in a second.\nSpeaker 8: But just to see, you know, the community engagement, the level of the commissions and as the community as this percolates through the community and through the planning process, it's great to see in the collaboration between the staff and the developer and the community.\nSpeaker 8: And I know you are probably now that we're losing, Jon, the most valuable player here in Alameda. So I just want to continue that sports metaphor. So as we go forward, you know, there's four things I'll be looking for updates on in the next meeting.\nSpeaker 8: You know, like I said, the pictures are pretty, but, you know, it's crunch time now. So as a council member doesn't mention it's time to, you know, see the economics of the business deal. So I'll be looking forward to hearing more about that in our next meeting.\nSpeaker 8: The Economics of the TDM, you know, it sounds like, you know, it's an amazing plan, but you know, is it sustainable over the long term? I mean, we had the picture of the Amerigo Amerigo around, you know, and that's facing trouble.\nSpeaker 8: So I want to see if we're going to put in a TDM plan, you know that 20, 25, 30 years, you know, if people are still on busses or whatever, you know that it's sustainable on that. We're not building something that that's, you know, that's set up to fail.\nSpeaker 8: And then I also think, you know, we need to you know, we talked earlier about, you know, wage inequality and, you know, fighting to keep the wages up in our community. And, you know, we have this housing issue.\nSpeaker 8: And one of the reasons why I'm so excited about this plan is because it deals with our housing shortage. And if we can, we've seen our employers, they want housing for their employees. You know, they've made that unfortunately clear today.\nSpeaker 8: You know, we've heard from from tenants in the last few months about the pressure on rents. And if, you know, this development could act as a steam valve and then release some of that pressure, you know, then some of our tenants may not feel the heat that they've been feeling, you know, from increasing rents.\nSpeaker 8: So I think we have to be cognizant of that. And, you know, one thing I'll be looking for two things. Looking for an update on, you know, one is the project labor agreement. I hope that we have some positive updates on that at the next meeting.\nSpeaker 8: And I was excited about the innovation, you know, and the green tech and the hubs and, you know, the ten businesses of ten. But, you know, there are still some protections that need to be made, in my mind, for the legacy businesses.\nSpeaker 8: So if we're putting a hotel out there that's not ten of ten, you know, that's one of 100 or one employer, you know, employing, you know, hundreds of people. And the same thing with, you know, large grocers, I'm you know, I'm excited about The Hub.\nSpeaker 8: But, you know, as the vice mayor mentioned earlier, you know, I'm worried about, you know, Walmart putting getting a foothold in Alameda. And I don't want to see them go to, you know, one of these spaces ultimately. So, you know, I've talked to, you know, folks about this.\nSpeaker 8: I see Ty in the audience and I've talked to, you know, a couple of the developers. And the this issue of labor, peace and card check neutrality, you know, is important to me. And for those that don't know, I mean, it basically says, you know, for these large hotels and if there's a large, you know, 15,000 type\nSpeaker 8: square foot grocer that we talked about early that decides to come in there, that, you know, they agree to what's called labor peace. You know, if somebody wants that, the employees want to organize, they don't stand in the way.\nSpeaker 8: And in exchange, the employees decide not to, you know, cause a work stoppage during during the organization. So I've talked about this and it's the developer and I hope to see some progress reported back and those four issues at the next meeting.\nSpeaker 0: Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 9: My major concern on this, the concept of this is still this project in the context of the entire West and the northern waterfront and the burden of residential units that are in the pipeline already and that are currently zoned.\nSpeaker 9: And we heard about another one tonight to keep an eye on, and that's the annexation of the two parcels at Alameda Landing. So I think that that is still a concern of mine. And real job creation is the other concern.\nSpeaker 9: And I a second councilmember Otis reference to labor peace which is really a fairness issue, particularly for workers at the lowest end of the spectrum when you talk about hotel workers and there's a hotel that is prominent in this plan.\nSpeaker 9: And I think at some point there's going to be a hotel at our middle point, regardless of what happens with site or site B or Main Street. I think those are important factors. I think of the kind of energy that goes around building these job clusters.\nSpeaker 9: I think we've already started with wider. And I think I'd like to see that energy continuous. Well, I'm taking lots of notes on this and. Trying to look at the best way to deliver workforce housing. I think we have enough market rate housing in the city.\nSpeaker 9: We do need workforce housing and I'd like to be able to champion a way to make that 100% rather than 25% or 15%, because that's where the need is.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And I agree with many of the comments of my council members and of the public. And I actually would like to just start with the last comment from vice mayor regards to workforce housing. We've had and and I've had many people come to us thinking that this will accommodate this housing here, will serve their particular\nSpeaker 0: needs of having rent increase and not being able to afford to live in Alameda. And when I look at this. As far as I can tell, when we're looking at the number of apartments in that, it's actually the tallest building, which I think is the closest to the water.\nSpeaker 0: The white building in regards to housing is apartments. I would like to know what entry level rates we're looking at for market rate apartments. I attended the RAC hearing this past, the past RAC meeting and there was a gentleman who said that he makes over six figures and cannot afford the rent increase for a two bedroom rental\nSpeaker 0: here in town. I think it's I'm very concerned that we are talking about entry apartment rentals of a rent of 3 to $4000 for market rate. And I don't think that that is actually.\nSpeaker 5: And.\nSpeaker 0: I don't think that that's not likely to happen. And I really think it's important that we be upfront with what we're talking about with our maidens so that the mother that comes here and says her daughter's a teacher and she's looking to live in one of these apartments, we need to know what would the rent be?\nSpeaker 0: And I think and also in regards to here in California, new apartments built after apartments built after 95. We cannot ever put rent control on per state law unless the state law changes. So anyone that is thinking that rent control could at some point attach to these new rentals.\nSpeaker 0: Not unless state law changes is not going to happen. So I personally, my priorities are to meet the needs of our maidens and people that work here currently and the workforce that I know of. I'm happy to have the 20% below market rate.\nSpeaker 0: It appears that 128 will be the low and very low, and that's in one of these 50 foot buildings, if I'm correct. And then that leaves 72 more. And could someone tell me where will the other 72 be?\nSpeaker 0: Could it be in the townhomes, or will that also be an apartment store? And I actually don't see condos in here if there are supposed to be condos. And I'm looking at page 11 of the supplement and if someone could actually get that up on the screen so we can talk about the height and how it is\nSpeaker 0: highest, where the rentals are near the water and the lowest as you get to the townhomes. That I think is what would be available for people to purchase.\nSpeaker 5: So the first question. Yes.\nSpeaker 8: Was.\nSpeaker 7: Can you state your first question?\nSpeaker 0: Okay, I'll start if you have any idea what Brentwood started, and I believe it's building 11 is the white tall building. Is that Building 11?\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. I have to see Beyonce going.\nSpeaker 7: To be you know, they're going to be market rate rents. I don't have a residential developer here tonight. You know, they will not be. The cheapest rents. I mean, this this is new construction. We're supporting a lot of new infrastructure.\nSpeaker 7: So but we will be providing 25% affordable in the project, which is two thirds more than, you know elsewhere in the city and elsewhere in the Bay Area.\nSpeaker 0: And that's. So I appreciate that as a. So instead of 15% below market rate will be 20% below 25, 25% below market rate. Thank you. Page 11 on hair. Could you get to start as it's slow? Okay, thanks.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So at some point I'll be looking to know you have disclosed to us before I vote to approve this and when I want to have an numbers on what the entry and what the rents will be in this building 11.\nSpeaker 0: And it's this orange one here. And that one it says 65 feet, but it could be higher because it has a two asterisks. Do we have an idea do you have an idea of how high you expect that to be?\nSpeaker 7: 65 feet. I mean, so that we can go unless there's a finding supported by the planning board that. But, you know, our expectation is it will be 65 feet. That's what we're planning today.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And within those apartments, do you expect any of the remaining 70 to moderate rate housing to be in there or will all that be market rate?\nSpeaker 7: Some of the 72 moderates will be in that building. They'll be in podium nine. You know, in the first phase, we currently assume they'll be in the apartments. We have the ability to move them into the townhomes. That's really going to be a function of, you know, as we get closer to the market and look at, you\nSpeaker 7: know, how rents continue to move versus for sale prices continue to move, you know, we'll have that flexibility. But right now, you know, we've assumed that those moderate would be in parcels nine and 11.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So as we get more condos.\nSpeaker 7: So on the parcel three in phase two, that is a podium project. We've assumed all of phase two will be for sale currently, and so that's 104 units that would be condo.\nSpeaker 0: And what about housing?\nSpeaker 7: And we typically put on all of our apartment buildings. Condo maps is a fairly common practice. So, you know, if the market were to shift, you know, we could convert some of the apartments to condos. But, you know, again, we think, you know, apartments are important.\nSpeaker 7: Rentals are important for the reason we haven't built any market rate rental in Alameda for quite some time. And it's very important for workforce development and that's a very key. We want to support that around midpoint.\nSpeaker 0: And that's why I'm looking for what the entry level would be, because I think we might have different, different definitions that have been used tonight in regards to what is workforce. And I think it's very important that we determine who could actually afford to live in these apartments.\nSpeaker 0: So I will be looking for a breakdown of how many of those will be moderate and if they will be apartments versus the shadows. And then a number of it's shown here is number nine will also be condos.\nSpeaker 0: Then it's 182 residential units.\nSpeaker 7: That's currently planned as all apartments.\nSpeaker 0: That's all apartments.\nSpeaker 7: And that can include some of the moderate to affordable as well. That will include some of the moderate affordable as well.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: And that's.\nSpeaker 6: What what buildings that I lost track.\nSpeaker 0: Of nine.\nSpeaker 6: Or something.\nSpeaker 0: Is orange on here.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Because I want to work across and that's also 65 feet. Are you planning for that to be 65 feet?\nSpeaker 7: That'll be up to 65 feet. That's very possibly be lower. You know, it could be a four story right now. I think we've shown it as a four story, but it could be up to 65 feet per the precise plan.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I'm sorry, going back to 11 when you're talking about apartments, but they be within each unit, it would be one floor.\nSpeaker 7: It's flats. Yes, one floor. Correct.\nSpeaker 0: And same with number nine on those units. Would those be one floor, one floor flats?\nSpeaker 7: That's correct.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: And then the the low and very low is number eight.\nSpeaker 7: That is correct.\nSpeaker 0: And that could have some senior housing.\nSpeaker 7: Is that right? Yeah. There's a couple different programs being looked at. You know, a blend of senior and family and an all family.\nSpeaker 0: And when will we know what that will look like?\nSpeaker 7: I would.\nSpeaker 0: That's. I'm sorry. That's been another need. Senior housing has something that I've heard repeatedly for both affordable and below market rate.\nSpeaker 5: Yes.\nSpeaker 7: Definitely. We've we've heard that a lot from the community.\nSpeaker 0: So if you could both.\nSpeaker 7: We we need both.\nSpeaker 0: Right. So if you could get back with me or us on that. Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: I just want to add, we have a settlement agreement with renewed hope, as you heard from the executive director, Laura Thomas. And we're working with them to determine mean. I think, to be honest, if it were up to staff and the developer, I think we were proposing a half senior half family.\nSpeaker 2: We right now, the way our agreements and transactions are looking is we're going to keep the flexibility open to make sure that we confirm with renewed hope and that agreement that we have with them that that that's consistent with that agreement.\nSpeaker 2: And we just have to make sure there's all these other documents and agreements that are in place. We have to make sure that they're all consistent.\nSpeaker 8: But if we.\nSpeaker 2: So we're working with them to determine that they think that how doing have senior half family is consistent with that settlement agreement. That's why you haven't heard a more definitive commitment from us because we just want to make sure we all of our transaction documents are consistent with those other agreements and legal obligations that we have.\nSpeaker 2: And so we're working through that and we don't want to. You don't want to move that too fast.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I appreciate that. And before we continue, because we're approaching 11 p.m., do we have a motion to continue the meeting and we require three votes to do that?\nSpeaker 7: On the move.\nSpeaker 0: All those in favor. I.\nSpeaker 5: I. I.\nSpeaker 0: A number of them did you vote for? I think at least four were in favor of not. Thank you. All right. So continuing on the townhomes from reading the House report, it appears that those will be three level homes, that's for sure.\nSpeaker 0: And so if it's a three level home, will it have a home above it or because it's 40 feet?\nSpeaker 7: The vertical will all be a single home.\nSpeaker 0: A single home, three levels. And all the townhomes will have three levels.\nSpeaker 7: That's the current plan.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. And you have. So the entry floor would be on the first floor.\nSpeaker 2: Right.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then where would you expect to have the washer and dryer up? And I'm going I'm going to ask because I also attend meetings for the disabled here. Our Commission and universal housing. An issue has come up that some homes are now being designed with a bedroom on the first floor with a kitchen and a bath\nSpeaker 0: . But the washer and dryer are on the second or third floor. So in regards to access for a mobility impaired, that's pretty difficult.\nSpeaker 6: Could I could I just interject a related question? Is there any thought given to universal design in these units?\nSpeaker 7: Yes, there is. We have provisions in the development plan and I think in the conditions of approval for universal design. So we haven't designed anything yet. So but yes, there are provisions for it and we plan to incorporate it.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Which I think will answer some of those questions.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So I wanted to raise the issue of the washer and dryer so you're aware of that has been a concern, um, regards to access of course for everyone then. Okay. The distance between the existing ferry and your new ferry.\nSpeaker 0: Do you have an idea how far they are?\nSpeaker 7: I mean, I don't.\nSpeaker 0: The staff the staff have an idea how far the current area on Main Street is from where the new ferry proposed new ferry will be.\nSpeaker 2: Try the existing ferry on the estuary. Yeah, it's about a mile, mile and a half from the site.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. An issue. And then when I looked at these drawings, I was trying to find one that has the fairy in the sea playing lagoon. Is that where the theory is proposed to go in sea? Playing lagoon.\nSpeaker 7: In sea. Plain lagoon? Yes. Closer toward the. The Ready Reserve Fleet.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: So Civic Avenue.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I'd like to see what that will actually look like because the drawings I saw in here of Sea Playing Lagoon had in fact like the page 20 on the presentation. It has what appears to me to be very recreational use and I'm not quite sure how ferry coming in and out of that same lagoon will\nSpeaker 0: look like. So I'd like to see in the future where the fairy where the new fairy proposed fairy will be. And I'm also interested in how that will impact the use of the sea playing lagoon.\nSpeaker 2: Beijing, the development.\nSpeaker 7: I know it's been purposely located at the foot of Pacific Avenue to avoid the conflicts with recreational uses and and to, you know, keep the wake away from recreational uses over closer to the main plaza of the seaplane lagoon.\nSpeaker 7: That was the intent of locating it there.\nSpeaker 6: Although, for the record, I'll just note that if you take the existing Main Street ferry, you do certainly see sailboat traffic and container ships and other, you know, traffic all the way from Alameda to San Francisco. But certainly in that channel in the estuary, those juxtapositions exist.\nSpeaker 0: So in regards to the drawing, I'm looking at page 20 that has the use. I don't I don't see it in there. So I'd like it to be accurately depicted so that when we're looking at this.\nSpeaker 2: You know.\nSpeaker 0: And and it does.\nSpeaker 2: It was fun.\nSpeaker 0: And it doesn't show that corner. But I, I, I think it's important for our meetings to understand what we're talking about here.\nSpeaker 6: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Um.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: All right. On page 29.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So that's. So I'm looking for a drawing that has the recreation. So the, the drawing I'm looking at page 29, actually, it doesn't have any sailboats or recreational use. I mean, assuming you're referring to the one of the top left corner.\nSpeaker 2: Page six does the town. I mean, you just want to make sure we understand exactly what. Can. So we show this on a show. The show where two. Here's the very. It really is. That is have this come in in right here.\nSpeaker 2: Get there fast and avoid you know, this is 111 acres and. So looking at it, coming in right here at the base to try to just keep, you know. I.\nSpeaker 0: Right. So. I'd like a depiction that clearly shows like the sailboats and the wherever the ferry supposed to go.\nSpeaker 6: Not to put too fine a point on this, but in that pretty picture you showed us. Remind me, what patient was mayor aged 20?\nSpeaker 0: Has that pretty what I call the pretty picture with the sailboats and whatnot. And it doesn't show that corner. Uh, if that isn't.\nSpeaker 6: Isn't that vessel steaming across? Is that not a ferry? No, no, it doesn't come out.\nSpeaker 7: That's the fairy. Would not be their.\nSpeaker 0: The fairy would not be there, I think.\nSpeaker 5: Mm hmm. I mean.\nSpeaker 2: What you're looking at there is. That's probably.\nSpeaker 0: I think it's just.\nSpeaker 6: A little pleasant. Also, it's not. It's intense. This is the aerial massing view looking east, though.\nSpeaker 9: On calcium.\nSpeaker 5: You know.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then the comments in regards to this reduced price passes and I agree with member de SAC, if there's a way to make that available to all at our meat and somehow because we really are trying to get all elements of access this reduced price passes, I'm not sure how you're getting the prices, but if we\nSpeaker 0: can get find out somehow. But there are other Allen meetings that are interested in buying this pass. So yes. So that we could somehow make it less expensive for all our meetings. And I think that would go to reduce encouraging the public transportation for.\nSpeaker 2: All.\nSpeaker 0: Our meetings. And I agree with Member De SAG in regards to trying to make it more available for everyone.\nSpeaker 5: Um.\nSpeaker 0: You know, anyone that goes there, hopefully they can take public transportation there and back to their homes or back to BART or back to the ferry. And then I have a question in regards to the drought. I have had Al Maidens ask me so recently we've been told that we need to reduce our water usage.\nSpeaker 0: And are these homes being designed in a manner to use as little water as possible? And do we have and not necessary for me, but from staff, possibly what the net increase in water will be to accommodate these homes?\nSpeaker 0: And do we have communications with East Bay mud and to see how this will impact all of almeida's access to water during the drought.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, I mean, the East Bay mud process in and of itself has certainly become much more strict over the last several years in terms of applying for water before we just sent in an application saying we wanted certain size meters and paid a fee and they showed up.\nSpeaker 7: And now it's you know, we are submitting very detailed counts on all of our water demand, very low flow fixtures. We will be plumbing this for reclaimed water use, you know, both exterior and interior. So this will be, you know, the lowest water using project in Alameda when it's complete.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, I'm fairly confident with that, you know, just because the standards are clearly moving in that direction and consistent with other projects we've developed in town.\nSpeaker 0: Remember.\nSpeaker 6: I believe along those lines that we will have an upcoming staff report related to these be met in the drought and water regulation. So more information coming to us.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. And including the additional 800 some homes in this project in its entirety. Thank you. So overall, the concern I have is that I think the homes with the water view will be the market rate homes. It will be in the towers and they'll have the activity of the water and the and the homes to purchase would\nSpeaker 0: be. The townhomes. And this is phase one I'm looking at. Mm hmm. And those are closest to Main Street. And there are so so I think that that the the the the renters paying the highest rent will have views of the water, the people.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm not sure what the entry level prices would be on the townhomes if those will be available to what I'm going to call workforce housing at two. So I'd like to see when you have the prices of what you think the entry level prices will be on those two, but that is closest to Main Street.\nSpeaker 0: That's all I have at this point. Any other council comments?\nSpeaker 7: I guess so. In terms of like. Eight. Making owner occupied housing affordable. I mean, there's a lot of ways to slice and dice that we can have some kind of strategy with regard to FHA. First time homebuyer type of program.\nSpeaker 7: Because when we're talking about affordability for owner occupied housing, sometimes it's not simply the price that that's the roadblock, but it's also the amount of the time for a down payment. So things like an FHA program, to the extent that, you know, the project qualifies for that, which I'm sure it would.\nSpeaker 7: No, it's it's a way of of of of making market rate housing available to a broader segment of homebuyers.\nSpeaker 5: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 7: Something to keep in mind, right.\nSpeaker 6: Mary?\nSpeaker 0: Yes, Mary Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 6: Very related to that. There's an assembly bill pending right now. One of the co-sponsors is our assembly representative. Our Assembly member, Rob Bonta. It's Assembly Bill 1335. Those of you who were at the recent development forum heard me talk about it.\nSpeaker 6: Right now, as I understand it. It's this bill is going into committee this week, toward the end of this week. And if it indeed comes out of committee, we are going to ask that this council do a resolution in support.\nSpeaker 6: And what it does is it it imposes certain fees on real estate transactions, but not transactions involving the purchase or sale of a residential home that's that's being acquired by an owner occupier. But what the the fees will go toward is a trust fund that helps to construct affordable housing, helps for first time buyer affordability programs.\nSpeaker 6: When when member de SAG just mentioned that, it jogged my memory and there's a whole list of other really great benefits. So it's something that the League of California Cities has asked has come out in support of and has asked other cities around the state to do so as well.\nSpeaker 6: So I believe we have a connection to this family member's office is going to keep us posted on whether the bill comes out of committee at the end of this week and then look at a resolution coming to a council close to you.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, it'll be one tool.\nSpeaker 6: April 29th, which is Thursday. No. Oh, it's next. It's next week, actually. Okay.\nSpeaker 8: And the speaker's authority.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Ernst, did you want to add any more comments?\nSpeaker 5: No, I just want to say.\nSpeaker 7: That I think one tool that's being designed to try to replace redevelopment, you know, funding for affordable. You know, right now without redevelopment, it's being funded by heavily subsidized by private development.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any other council comments? All right, then. I think we can. STAFF Did you want any more direction on this? You're.\nSpeaker 3: I don't think we need anymore. I think we have a direction.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So then I think we're finished with this agenda item. And then I'm going to move on to number seven, City Manager Communications. Is that where we jump to now?\nSpeaker 5: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 9: I think we aren't.\nSpeaker 6: Well, I think under the circumstances you can make.\nSpeaker 3: No, that's quite all right. I'm I don't have any communications this evening. Thank you very.\nSpeaker 0: Much. But my.\nSpeaker 6: Understanding now, therefore.\nSpeaker 9: I'm expecting to hear tomorrow.\nSpeaker 0: All right.\nSpeaker 1: So then no additional speakers.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Council communications. We can skip that and we can now during the meeting. Yes, I will. Now, during the meeting. Thank you. You.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Agenda Item three Council Bill 120112 Amending Ordinance 126 237, which adopted the 2021 budget, including the 2021 through 2026 Capital Improvement Program. The committee recommends the bill.\nSpeaker 0: Pass as amended. Thank you so much. Okay. Council members say that now we can talk about the supplemental budget ordinance. I'm going to hand it over to you to provide the committee reports.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Council President. Apologies, colleagues. Let's talk about agenda item number three. This is Council Bill 120112. As I was beginning to say, this is the second comprehensive supplemental budget legislation that has been transmitted by the executive to the Council in 2021.\nSpeaker 1: This proposed midyear appropriation included positions and capital projects necessary to meet the needs that were unforeseeable at the time of the 2021 budget. Adoption in November of 2020. Several departments totaled mid-year. Supplemental improvements include necessary investments in key categories like Office of Labor Standards, which is receiving $1.8 million, which is to go to the drivers resolution center\nSpeaker 1: . This was a key piece of legislation that the Council passed to make sure that Lyft and Uber and other good drivers had a driver resolution center to make sure that they had their needs met. Excited about that piece.\nSpeaker 1: Another piece that I'm excited to lift up is $2.5 million that goes into several programs at the Department of Arts and Culture. This includes 1.6 million from the Municipal Arts Fund for public art projects associated with the waterfront.\nSpeaker 1: As we look to continue to get folks out and actively engage our community, especially along the waterfront, I know there's a lot of anticipation for that and includes things like $2.5 million to increase the FAA fund to support staffing and contract suppliers and operations of vaccine sites that the city works so diligently to make sure we're available\nSpeaker 1: for our residents and we're making sure that we're providing the funding necessary for those previous operations. The Neighborhood Large Vision Zero Project is also included. $2 million is going to move Seattle increase to a $2 million increase from the Seattle Levee Fund is going to implement changes recommended by the Levy Oversight Committee to increase support for safety\nSpeaker 1: projects and accelerate in-demand neighborhood projects. I'm excited about a few additional amendments that the colleagues on the committee help to support and include in the legislation in front of you. And if I may, Madam President, just want to highlight a few of those before turning it over to our colleagues that have really made this a robust supplemental\nSpeaker 1: discussion. This includes. Thank you, Madam President. This includes the inclusion of an additional position at Seattle Fire Department for a crisis counselor. This will assist with training and facilitating conversations with Seattle Fire Department personnel. Colleagues, this is a complement to the crisis counselor that we provided in last year's budget that provides trauma informed counseling services, referrals and\nSpeaker 1: trainings for those who are focused on scene safety and making sure that we're keeping firefighters safe and in increasing the positive interactions that they have with individuals in crisis or suffering from mental health and behavioral health issues. We now with this funding will have two crisis counselors, one within Seattle Fire Department and one again within the local\nSpeaker 1: 27 trust to make sure that we really have reduced the barriers for firefighters to be able to access crisis counselors. I'm also excited about the $200,000 that we included in this supplemental budget to make sure that we're helping provide funding for material support as we continue to build tiny houses through organizations such as sound foundations, Northwest.\nSpeaker 1: And finally, I will be I will try to be brief as we have worked on a large amendment with Councilmember Herbold as vice chair of finance and housing, but as chair of public safety, as we were on the cusp of passing the supplemental budget, we did get word from the mayor's office and then subsequent press events, about\nSpeaker 1: $15 million underspend. And so it Councilmember Herbold, than I did with the support of the colleagues on the committee, was work to bring forward an amendment that included many strategies to address public safety and to couple those public safety investments with community efforts to scale up alternatives to our traditional police response by making sure that we had\nSpeaker 1: investments directly into community. I think the package in front of us, including the amendment that we worked on, is an important balance, an important balance of investing and the community services civil service positions 3 hours. One represents an effort to make sure that we're meeting council and executive priorities and that we have expressed our intent to to\nSpeaker 1: make sure that we are moving forward with things like making sure that the mental health providers are available for front line responders, for making sure that we are paying for paid parental leave, addressing the increased use of overtime by making sure that we're recognizing that that overtime is probably larger than what was actually needed given the fourth\nSpeaker 1: wave of COVID and that we've made sure that we've invested in King County regional peacekeepers and the funding that was needed to make sure that our community has the funding that they need to respond to these crises. I'm most most excited to highlight the $3 million that we have included in this proposal as well, to invest in\nSpeaker 1: the human service department, community safety contracts that are needed to provide stability so that there's truly a landing zone or a landing place, as the firefighters have talked about, so that we can extend those contracts from not just not just 18 months, but truly to two years.\nSpeaker 1: And we have received support from those frontline responders that that's really important to have stability for the community partners so that when 911 is called, if fire or police show up, they have someone to refer those individuals to.\nSpeaker 1: That is what those agencies safety and contracts are doing. We are excited about those, but let's make sure that they last for at least two years. So the $3 million investment in councilmember, verbal and EIS amendment that was passed in committee accomplishes that.\nSpeaker 1: I'm proud of the work that we've done in front of us. I know that there's a few amendments for us to discuss today, but I want to thank all of you for your work on the supplemental. It it was three months in our committee intentionally so that we could address this underspend and and respond to the need\nSpeaker 1: for public safety investments as well as community investment so that upstream solutions could be funded as well as investments in our cities as departments, please Council President, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to this and I'll hold the remainder of my comments.\nSpeaker 0: Great. All right. Colleagues, we do have several amendments. My suggestion, sort of consistent with how we usually structure these conversations, is to go through the amendments and and before opening up discussion and debate on the substance of the bill.\nSpeaker 0: If there's no objection, I would like to go ahead and proceed in that manner. So. Consideration of amendments, first debate on amendments. And then we can sort of make closing wrap wrap up comments on the bill as amended.\nSpeaker 0: Is there any objection to proceeding in that way? It seems to make the most sense to me. Okay, so why don't we go ahead and go through the amendments? I do have a list of all of the amendments in front of me, including the sponsors of said amendments.\nSpeaker 0: I'm just going to I'm just going to keep us moving through this and call on each council member as they're listed in my in my script here. So let's go ahead and move over to Councilmember Herbold, who I understand is intending to move Amendment One.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you so much. I move to amend Council Bill 12 0112 as presented as Amendment one on the agenda.\nSpeaker 1: Right now.\nSpeaker 0: It's been moved and seconded by Councilman Mosquito to adopt Amendment One as presented on the agenda. And I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Herbold to address the amendment.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you so much. So this amendment is a technical amendment. It moves appropriation authority within the Seattle Police Department budget summary levels to effectuate the spending cycle, the spending of salary savings described in Section 20 of Council Bill 12 zero one.\nSpeaker 3: One two, including the technology updates, the civilian divisions, the work scheduling timekeeping project, the junior contract, the SPD mental health provider program, contract, background services, separation pay shortfall, the deferred compensation shortfall and paid parental leave. This is consistent with a long held priority of mine for the oversight of the Seattle Police Department, where we work to make\nSpeaker 3: sure that the appropriation authority is in place in advance of the spending so that we don't have a situation where SPV, in essence, goes forward with the spending in alignment with their objectives and comes back to council after the fact and asks us to approve it after those decisions have already been made.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Excellent colleagues. Any comments or questions on Amendment One? I'm not seeing any. We did have a conversation about this amendment during a council briefing, so thanks so much for the opportunity to engage on that this morning as well.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, colleagues. Hearing and seeing no additional comments. Will the clerk please.\nSpeaker 1: Call the.\nSpeaker 0: Role on the adoption of Amendment One?\nSpeaker 2: PETERSON That's.\nSpeaker 1: So what? Yes.\nSpeaker 4: Strauss Yes.\nSpeaker 1: HERBOLD Yes. Suarez, I. Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Morales. As a setter by President Gonzalez hi nine in favor nine opposed.\nSpeaker 0: The motion carries the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the council. We're not going to go ahead and move over to Councilmember Lewis, who has amendment to.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. I moved to amend Council Bill 1 to 0 one one to as presented on Amendment 2/2.\nSpeaker 0: It's been moved and seconded by Councilmember Peterson to adopt Amendment two as presented on the agenda and to hand it back over to Councilmember Lewis to walk us through his minutes.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. Fairly simple amendment. I touched on it this morning at briefing. This amendment was recommended by the City Budget Office to move some money that I amended at committee into this bill from the Human Services Department, into the Planning Department to take advantage of an existing contract for capital support in the Planning Department for\nSpeaker 2: the Chief Seattle Club, which has a permanent supportive housing project that this amendment aims to provide support to. It is merely a technical amendment to take advantage of that existing contract and more efficiently get that investment out the door.\nSpeaker 2: And happy to answer any questions otherwise. Stand by those comments.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you so much, colleagues. Any additional comments or questions on Amendment two? All right. Hearing on all these other on the adoption of an amendment to Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: So far.\nSpeaker 5: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Strauss Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Herbold Yes. Suarez, I.\nSpeaker 2: Lewis Yes.\nSpeaker 6: Morales Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Mosqueda i. President Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Nine in favor.\nSpeaker 0: An unopposed motion carries the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the council. So we are going to move now to Amendment three A and I'll hand it over to Councilmember Peterson to make his motion.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President I and just for context, there are two options here, but I'll go ahead and move the first option. I move to amend counts 4120112 as presented as Amendment three A on today's Council agenda.\nSpeaker 4: Second.\nSpeaker 0: It's been moved and seconded by Councilmember Juarez to adopt Amendment three A as presented on the agenda. I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Peterson to walk us through his amendment.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Council president, colleagues. This budget amendment would allocate funds that were already in city's adopted 2021 budget to help recruit and retain personnel because we've lost 300 officers and detectives over the past 18 months. There are two options for the amendment option and would keep 3 million within these budget for recruitment and retention, whereas option B\nSpeaker 2: would take it on allocated 1.1 million and dedicated for recruitment and retention. This first vote is on option one. The larger amount, colleagues, I believe this motion should be viewed in the bigger picture of the substantial investments and actions that we have taken and will continue to take to boost human services programs and to reimagine public safety\nSpeaker 2: as we await various alternatives to be put in place. We must also recognize the tidal wave of attrition, the spike in 911 response times for priority one and priority two calls the benefits of having community policing officers and detectives, and as noted by the Monitor, the federal consent decree.\nSpeaker 2: The need to have sufficient staffing to advance and sustain reforms for the department that we still have. We also have an obligation under City Charter Article six, Section one, to maintain adequate police protection in each district of the city.\nSpeaker 2: I want to thank the Reverend Harriet Walden, the leader of Mothers Police Accountability for supporting these amendments, for recruitment and retention, as well as many people who sent emails and support. I also want to acknowledge everyone who called in today to voice their opposition and concern.\nSpeaker 2: I also hear you. It's important to note these funds were already funded to SBT as part of the 2021 budget. So labeling the proposals as a funding I don't believe is fully accurate. These amendments would, however, focus some of those funds for recruitment and retention.\nSpeaker 2: Option A would still enable the human services programs to be funded all through next year, 2022. And we have plenty of opportunities to extend and expand those effective programs later this fall or next year. But we are in the middle of an SBT staffing crisis now.\nSpeaker 2: Specifically option would keep the 3 million with 233,000 for hiring incentives for the last three months of this year, plus the remainder of the 2.7 million as an immediate down payment for flexible retention strategies, which could include retention pay but does not have to.\nSpeaker 2: It's authorized by a separate bill that I had introduced earlier. These what I believe modest amounts in my budget amendment go beyond mere words to demonstrate that we recognized the impacts of the staffing crisis and that we want our remaining officers and detectives to stay in Seattle.\nSpeaker 2: So rather than delaying until the end of November to vote on this for next year's budget, we can take this swifter action this week to reduce the amount of time Seattle residents wait for an officer after calling 911.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, are there any additional comments or questions on the amendment? Okay. I have three folks in the queue. First up, is councilmember verbal, then Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember one.\nSpeaker 3: You so much. I totally agree that hiring and retention is a really important issue and important I agree with it in not just words, but in action. The legislation before us, as amended by the Finance and Budget Committee and without Councilmember Peterson's amendment, includes recruitment, support by hiring, by funding, hiring process accelerators.\nSpeaker 3: The topic merits additional attention, and I believe it merits additional attention through the annual budget process, which begins in a couple of weeks. And I, I believe this because I want to look at the vacancy rates of all city departments and look at this question of how we incentivize folks taking these good family wage jobs across all\nSpeaker 3: the departments that are experiencing vacancies right now. Central staff has determined that the executive has documented staffing shortages and accompanying service delivery issues in and a few different departments. And it's well known that the impacts of COVID on employment has been unprecedented, both for the private sector as well as the public sector, with people leaving their jobs\nSpeaker 3: and with sustained vacancies across most unemployment, most employment sectors as well. I value the delivery of city services of all city departments and if we need to just discuss recruitment, I think we need to consider vacancies across all city departments and whether we need to consider hiring bonuses to fulfill hiring goals and service delivery obligations for other\nSpeaker 3: departments as well. So I would support considering this within the context of 2022 budget and which will be weeks, the proposal from some member Peterson would authorize up to $15,000 per CPD hire if we are considering hiring bonuses for hires to other departments.\nSpeaker 3: We need to consider the possible citywide cost if we're if we're allowing for for one particular department up to $15,000 per hire. Just as a little bit of background on this topic, generally back in July, I request at a speedy send a memo to the city council to to make some recommendations for spending.\nSpeaker 3: Given the fact that we knew there was a lot of a lot of funds within the Seattle Police Department budget in the salary savings category that MPD was not going to be able to spend unless we authorized reallocation of some of those funds.\nSpeaker 3: And so in that memo, the police department requested funding for hiring bonuses, including, as I mentioned earlier, the hiring process accelerators. But there was no broader request at the time for funding for retention. So these are my comments as it relates to the retention piece of Councilmember Pearson's proposal.\nSpeaker 3: So I just want to highlight that as it relates specifically to retention, as I mentioned during budget, I mean, sorry, during briefings this morning, I really want to focus on the recommendations of a 2019 hiring and retention report that called for what are called wellness first schedules.\nSpeaker 3: These are 410 hour shifts that provide officers three consecutive days of rest for officers rather than just two. This has historically been the highest rated priority for my four officers, and I'm concerned that although the amendment includes some specific language $230,000 for the hiring bonuses piece, the description of the amendment by the sponsor is.\nSpeaker 3: Is. Is. Expresses a vague intent. And as the $30,000 is very specific for hiring bonuses and the larger amount of of the funds, the rest of the $3 million isn't specified for any particular use. That would mean it would likely need to be reauthorized during the 2026 in any event.\nSpeaker 3: So again, a package adopted by Finance and Housing Committee includes apology upgrades for that will support officer wellness and supervision that hundred and $20,000 that was included there. And so what I just want to note that many front line workers have received what's called appreciation pay for their service during the pandemic.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm supported up supportive of continuing discussions for how best to authorize appreciation pay for police officers. I'm very grateful for the work of Seattle Police Department and the officers who have not left SPD and remain committed to community safety and committed specifically to community safety in Seattle.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. And I want to thank the sponsor for bringing this amendment forward for the discussion. I am going to say at the top that I will not be voting for this amendment, but I want to expand on the reasons why.\nSpeaker 2: And I appreciate the opportunity for this debate. That's why this council is here to debate pressing public issues. I agree with the sponsor of the amendment and with Chair Herbold and her comments just now that we do have a police staff in crisis.\nSpeaker 2: And I think a lot of us on the council agree more broadly with that, which is why we fully funded a police hiring class for 2021. That's often not mentioned in the media or the stories discoursing about police hiring.\nSpeaker 2: But the council did fully fund a hiring class, and I don't disagree that a partial strategy to mitigate this crisis can be through the hiring and retention incentives that are being proffered today by Councilmember Peterson. When I disagree with his the reprioritization of the money component of this amendment, money earmarked for critical crime prevention programs in the\nSpeaker 2: Human Services Department. And I just want to make take a moment to discourse a little more broadly about the public safety crisis in the city and how alternative investments are needed and how they can make an impact. And I want to focus, particularly because it's been a big crisis in my district, and I know it has across\nSpeaker 2: many other districts. It's touched every district in the city throughout this year, and that's gun violence. And I want to start by strongly acknowledging the critical role that the police play in responding to and preventing gun violence. As of August 31st, Seattle police have recovered more than 700 guns this year, taking them off the street, physically removed\nSpeaker 2: 700 guns from the street and secured them. Seattle police continue to have, as part of their mission, serving extreme risk protection orders to seize firearms from folks who pose a safety risk to themselves or others. And these efforts undoubtedly prevent gun violence in our community, save lives and make the community safer.\nSpeaker 2: But there's limits to what police alone can achieve. And we need to keep leaning in to the investments this council has advocated for that can have a profound impact on gun violence prevention. And I think this becomes more evident when we look at the data on the shootings that we are seeing and experiencing in Seattle this year\nSpeaker 2: to really determine what can we do to intervene and prevent these shootings before they occur that are having such a horrible impact on our community. This last Friday, I listened to Kristen Nicole Fincher's Week in Review podcast for her hacks and walks highly recommended.\nSpeaker 2: If folks have haven't listened, I recommend you give it a shot. It's great. And Crystal and former Mayor McGinn had a great conversation about the current discourse our city is having around gun violence in particular. And they noted and I can't say I disagree from their discussion, that there's been a lack of critical analysis by many in\nSpeaker 2: the media to delve into our increase in shootings and what the data is indicating so that we can have a real response as a community on what we're going to do to deal with this epidemic of gun violence that is crippling our city and killing people in our community.\nSpeaker 2: And we need to see who are the victims. Who's doing the shooting. And we need to look holistically at how we can respond. And I want to briefly just just illustrate by sharing a little bit of analysis I did, because I was curious and getting information and data shared by the police department.\nSpeaker 2: And overwhelmingly in 2021, our neighbors experiencing homelessness have vastly and disproportionately been the victims of the increase in gun crime. According to data that was provided to me, a report by the police department on September 1st. So a bit over a week ago, we have had 64 shots fired incidents with a homeless nexus.\nSpeaker 2: That's up 120% from 2020. It's a huge part of the increase in gun violence we're seeing on the street. It's nearly one fifth of all the shootings that have occurred in 2010. And tragically, I had no doubt after the last 12 days since I got that data, that that data is probably out of date.\nSpeaker 2: And in almost all of these cases, the victim of the shooting is a neighbor experiencing homelessness. In most cases, the shooting occurs in an unsanctioned encampment setting. I raise this because police alone can't prevent these shootings. I have incredible gratitude for the officers that have been responding to these encampments and responding to these shootings and in many\nSpeaker 2: cases, apprehending a suspect. Recovering guns and getting them off the street. And I appreciate that exigent response. And I know it makes the community safer. But until people are provided with desirable alternative places to live with wraparound services, all we are doing is responding to encampments that are providing and in many cases in exigent hub of continued\nSpeaker 2: gun violence. And we're not proactively solving for the underlying causes of the trauma and the violence. We are also, frankly, putting more work and exposure on our officers to continue to respond in many cases to very dangerous situations by not solving for these underlying causes.\nSpeaker 2: And I know I'm a broken record on this, and I know I have agreement from my colleagues here nearly unanimously, but just care. Has undeniably prevented shootings that would have occurred, but for their intervention. Just care offers highly desirable, well-supported hotel room shelter spaces, which are overwhelmingly accepted by community members and by our neighbors experiencing homelessness.\nSpeaker 2: And a University of Washington study demonstrated that neighborhoods where chest care is active see a 38% reduction in 911 call volume after their outreach operations. I have no doubt that the just care outreach at the former encampment on Third Avenue downtown at the Second Avenue Extension and Pioneer Square at City Hall Park by the courthouse prevented shootings\nSpeaker 2: from occurring. That would have otherwise occurred because there is a clear correlation between having thousands of our residents exposed to the elements and their tragic likelihood of being a victim of gun crime. Bringing it back to the amendment.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's critical that we center these human services investments as a large portion of these salary savings. To invest in these proactive community safety strategies. And we need to look no further than the mentorship and community building efforts of community passageways to know that that's true and that's possible.\nSpeaker 2: Known gang related shootings this year have actually decreased in 2021. The city, the council and the mayor working together have expanded these youth support programs, and they're building strong communities. These innovative community programs can get to scale. They can give us the resources to build strong, supportive and safe communities.\nSpeaker 2: We shouldn't be pitting these investments against each other. And I stand by dedicating this money to the Human Services Department. And for that reason, I'm going to vote against this amendment.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for those comments. Councilmember Long.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I will be voting against this amendment. Needless to say, for members of the public who are listening to this budget bills should be a clear illustration of the importance of movement. At the height of the Justice for George Floyd movement, the majority of the council committed to defund the police by 50% and to instead put\nSpeaker 5: those funds into supporting community development into social needs. Now that the street movement has waned, every marginal victory that the movement won last year is under attack. We saw earlier this year how the majority of the city council drove in loopholes into the historic ban on the so-called crowd control weapons that our movement had won through the\nSpeaker 5: efforts of hundreds of activists and my council office. This is why our movement cannot trust the political establishment and why we need to build our own political power outside the Republican and Democratic parties through our party for working people.\nSpeaker 5: And keep in mind that here in Seattle, every council member currently except for my office is a Democrat. This is why I am a socialist on this issue. First, let's be clear about the double standard we are talking about.\nSpeaker 5: When council members like Peterson advocate for hiring bonuses in the Seattle Police Department. But it's frankly, it's not just Peterson who has talked about this today or in the past. The police are some of the highest paid people among city of Seattle employees making more than double what is paid to many social workers, like homeless service workers\nSpeaker 5: . The mayor has claimed that she cannot use the funding for shelter and dining villages, that the people's budget movement and other activists won in the last budget because there are not enough homeless service workers to staff new spaces.\nSpeaker 5: But other hiring bonuses are just a raise for the impoverished homeless service workers who actually help people turn their lives around. I have heard council members lamenting the rate of attrition among police officers. I would ask them as they looked at the turnover among social workers because of how low they are peers in relation to the services\nSpeaker 5: they provide. It should not be a surprise that there is low morale among police officers. Of course there is. Over the last year, we saw the murder of George Floyd. We saw Seattle police filling our communities with tear gas, pepper spraying children in the face, running over protesters, heads with bicycles.\nSpeaker 5: And all that is in addition to the usual level of violence from the police towards communities of color, working class communities and poor people, especially our homeless neighbors. And overall repressive policing practices. And we should, of course, know that the police do this with the consent of the political establishment.\nSpeaker 5: Of course, there is low morale among police officers when so many ordinary people have opened their eyes and are totally outraged by the harm that the police do. The solution is not to pretend that those problems and that are justifiable outrage doesn't exist.\nSpeaker 5: The solution is to hold police accountable for the violence that they do and to fund the needs of the community. I do not support reinstituting hiring bonuses for police, the highest paid people in the city. I do not support this amendment which would slash the funds to community programs to fund the expansion of repressive policing.\nSpeaker 5: Remember, the amount of police funding does not have any statistical any statistical impact on the amount of crime in a community. It is inequality that has a greater statistical impact. I absolutely share the concerns that ordinary people have about the rise in gun violence.\nSpeaker 5: I have that concern as well. There is no question that we need to address this. But if you look at this statistically, you would see that this is happening. Even though the police budget has been bloated for many years, the 50% difference hasn't happened.\nSpeaker 5: That demand was never fulfilled. And if you look at the data, the police budget has been bloated for many years. While the social services and affordable housing are working people, oppressed communities and the poor need continue to be gravely underfunded.\nSpeaker 5: And I don't just mean in the city, they are underfunded at the state level and at the federal level also. And at the same time, we are seeing rents by corporate landlords skyrocketing even in the midst of a pandemic.\nSpeaker 5: Studies show overwhelmingly that the best and really only solution to public safety issues is to fund the needs of our society to address crime, and particularly to stop crimes before they even happen. We need to fund affordable social housing expansion like we did with the Amazon tax, and that was important and historic.\nSpeaker 5: But it is not enough. We need to raise wages even further. We need to have rent control and other renters rights. And we need to end exploitation as a whole. Not. Increase repression. And in addition to all of this, we need an elected community oversight committee with full powers to hold the police accountable.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. So for your comments, are there any additional comments on Amendment three? A. Okay. I'm not seeing any other hands raised on Amendment three a. I do want to make sure that Councilmember Peterson has an opportunity to have the last word since this is his amendment.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Peterson to close out debate on Amendment 38.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, council president. Appreciate the comments from my colleagues and happy to just vote on Thursday and then we might be getting to three B sooner than I thought.\nSpeaker 0: Okey dokey. All right, colleagues, that does conclude debate on Amendment three. A So I am going to ask that the clerk please call the role on the adoption of Amendment three a Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Sir. What?\nSpeaker 5: No.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss.\nSpeaker 4: No.\nSpeaker 1: Her bold. Now, Juarez, I. Louis No. Morales No. Most scatter? No. President Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 0: No.\nSpeaker 1: Two in favor, seven opposed.\nSpeaker 0: The motion fails and the amendment is not adopted. So we're going to go ahead and move to Councilmember Peterson's Amendment three. BE So I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Peterson to make his motion.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council president and moved to amend council bill 12011 to as presented as amendment three be on today's council agenda.\nSpeaker 6: Second.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. It's been moved and seconded by Councilmember Juarez to adopt Amendment three B as presented on the agenda and handed back over to Councilmember Peterson to walk us through this amendment.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Council President, colleagues, this option B is A is a more modest version of what we were trying to do with option A. It would take just 1.1 million, which was previously unallocated by the council's finance committee.\nSpeaker 2: So it not part of the 20 2023 HST programs. I support those HST programs and will support them in 2023. This, however, is just $1 million and it's from an allocated portion. It would be dedicated toward retention and recruitment.\nSpeaker 2: It would be the same amount for recruitment 233,000, which is for the last three months of this year, and the remaining amount as a down payment toward efforts to retain existing officers and detectives. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks so much. I do see a couple of people with their hands raised. And so I'm going to go ahead and start calling on folks. Councilmember Herbals is up first.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. All of my comments that I made about recruitment and retention strategies and my belief that in addition to the funding that's in this legislation are for recruitment and retention strategies, which again, there is some funding in this bill devoted to those purposes.\nSpeaker 3: So all of my comments about the funding objectives that I made in the previous amendments still stand for this. I want to just very quickly speak to the funding source as I understand the proposal and the impacts of proposal.\nSpeaker 3: As I understand it, and from the central staff memo that if this amendment is passed in this department, spend it. Salary savings consistent with the modified intent and SPV would not have remaining salary savings to spend on some items that we have ident that council has identified as a priority and included support for and that it what\nSpeaker 3: we think would we not include support for it in this bill. But they have been identified by us as as I priorities and one of those is funding for a new CISO squad of at the rate of a $120,000 for 2021.\nSpeaker 3: Potential COVID related related compensation 0.5 million. And then the ID of $3 million to fund overtime costs. We did find $1.5 million of the requested $3 million of overtime, and that is authorized, authorized in Council Bill 12 0112 as amended.\nSpeaker 3: But then we specifically referenced the 1.5 million in the bill that came out of committee as potential sources for these. There are these other high priorities from the police department. So if we vote in favor of this second option, we're pretty close to zero rolling out Spd's budget and we can't look at funding of MPD, can't look\nSpeaker 3: at the funding for its other priorities in particular as it relates to the overtime. Although I'm really I'm glad that we have sort of held the line at adding 1.5 million through overtime in the bill before us. I just want to signal that my understanding that as it relates to some specific training priorities, specifically use of force\nSpeaker 3: training, de-escalation training, crisis response training, as well as some particular reviews that the police department has to do. Their force intervention, their fit reviews, their force reviews, their force review board reviews. These reviews are required for CPD to do in advance of an OPA investigation when there's an open investigation associated with the use of force.\nSpeaker 3: And there they have a big backlog on doing these two step reviews and these FRB reviews, which then delays the okay investigations. And then finally supervision ratios, sergeant to officer ratios. A lot of those. And so we think of some we think of over time, as, you know, over time for for emphasis patrols or overtime for associated\nSpeaker 3: with protest response. This is also a really critical use of overtime, particularly when the department does have a lot of vacancies. They then rely more on overtime so that officers can be paid to again complete the training, the required consent decree required training, these these vet reviews, the FBI reviews as well as the supervision ratios are part\nSpeaker 3: of the consent decree. So for this reason, I'm I apologize, but I cannot support the amendment, modified amendment with the different sorts of funds you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Her. Really appreciate that additional details. Councilmember Lewis, you are next in the Q and then Councilmember, go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. While I opposed Councilor Peterson's amendment, A, I do intend on voting for Amendment D today, and I want to expand on some of the reasons why. As I said before, I agree that the police staffing crisis is real, and I agree that we need to transition to a rightsize first response for police or\nSpeaker 2: one of several services that can be dispatched. We have a report now from the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, commissioned by SPD and funded by this council, indicating that 75% of calls for service could ultimately be handled by a civilian response service.\nSpeaker 2: We know that that number is contested by the department, but that there is a consensus on a sizable percentage. And we know that some of those services are being stood up. Now, those services have not been completely built, nor have they been scaled.\nSpeaker 2: And the council has taken those initial steps by building an independent dispatch service, which is critical and essential. We've expanded the Health One program. We're in the process of developing triage one, which will take on a large range of calls for service.\nSpeaker 2: My hope is that triage one will be in the mold of Denver Star program or Eugene, Oregon cahoots or something similar to those low acuity response programs. But this is still in the future. It's still being discussed. And we still don't completely know what role those programs will fill, let alone when they'll be at scale to take\nSpeaker 2: calls for service. I firmly believe, based on analyzing the whole national situation on policing and public safety, that the American cities of the future are going to be the cities that engage in this diversification of response services, not only for the benefit to health and wellness of getting a better tailored first response for calls for service.\nSpeaker 2: But because responding to historic levels of attrition for police to continue to fill the same footprint police have always filled in the United States is not going to be logistically possible. Police hiring is down 5% nationally. Resignations from police services have risen 18% and retirements have risen 45%.\nSpeaker 2: It's a crisis that is not unique to Seattle. New York City alone lost 5346 police officers in 2020, a 75% increase in their attrition rate. But such large attrition prior to the establishment of scale of alternative services and responses greatly hampers our ability as a city to provide first responders the only service that is the scale that\nSpeaker 2: can fill the role of exigent first responders as of our deliberations right now. Today is the police department. I didn't support Amendment A because the only way we're going to realize the future vision that all of us on the council share is going to be continuing to make steady and consistent investments in the Human Services Department to\nSpeaker 2: develop and and other departments to develop and create these response services and have those programs continue to be evaluated and scaled to take on new and bigger duties. But until that time, we need a viable police department capable of responding to exigent calls for service.\nSpeaker 2: For that reason, I'm voting in favor of taking a currently on dedicated portion of salary savings for some of these hiring and retention services and strategies, and will vote in favor of the amendment today.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis. Councilmember Saillant, you are next in line.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you again. I will be voting no on this amendment. I won't repeat what I said for the previous vote, but this proposal has all the same problems. I do not support increasing repressive policing. We should instead invest in reducing inequality.\nSpeaker 5: One year ago, council members were saying that they could not defund the police in 2020 as promised because they would require several months to lay off worker officers, police officers. But they said, don't worry, they will do so in 2021.\nSpeaker 5: Then in 2021, rather than cutting the bloated police budget, they instituted provisos to study out out of order layoffs. Now the supplemental budget ends those provisos, and they are talking about hiring bonuses to increase the size of the police force.\nSpeaker 5: The thing that change is the movement in 2020 where we had thousands on the street in Seattle, streets in Seattle protesting police violence. I do not support reinstituting hiring bonuses for the police and will be voting no on this amendment.\nSpeaker 5: And as members of the public know, I do have an amendment from my office to actually put some of the money in to the supporting Safe Communities, funding the Human Services Department. That will be upcoming. And I'll speak to that at that time.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks so much, Councilmember Swann. Are there any additional comments on Amendment three? B Councilmember Maceda, please.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Council President. Colleagues, I, too, wanted to give you my rationale for voting no on this amendment. I want to start with reminding ourselves about what is in this amendment. What is in this amendment largely reflects conversations that we've had with community, with the Seattle Fire, with members of the mayor's office about ideas to make sure\nSpeaker 1: that we are addressing some of the pressing stressors that we see in PD. That includes making sure that there is full funding, as requested for the mental health provider, full funding for the paid parental leave. As we know, more people have taken paid parental leave on sick leave because of a pandemic, which is something we want them\nSpeaker 1: to be doing. This includes the requested civilian support positions at 1.047 million to make sure that there's additional people who can respond to crises so that it doesn't have to be an armed officer with a badge and includes it includes a half a million requested for the King County Regional Peacekeepers Collective focused on addressing gun violence in\nSpeaker 1: King County. That is a proven public health strategy, again, as requested, to help relieve officers with the gun from having to show up. It also includes the requested 700,000 for triage, one with the additional amendment that we will be making to make sure that there is a appropriate and well thought through protocol system so that we are\nSpeaker 1: having community places where people can go when 911 when is called a true landing zone. We've included these things in addition to making sure that the CDC or the new department that we're standing up has the support that it needs to invest in the protocol system that Councilmember Herbold led on last year.\nSpeaker 1: It includes the two positions for public records, disclosure and i t to help alleviate some of the pressure that SBT is currently facing, apparently for their lack of response to their public requests, public records request. And we have included these positions to make sure that we're addressing the long backlog of PDR requests that will hopefully relieve some\nSpeaker 1: of the pressure on the existing staff as well. And in the wake of last year's uprising, there has been rightfully a call for us to increase demand for transparency and records requests. We want to do this. In addition to that, I want to underscore the importance of what council members have been talking about this morning, and that\nSpeaker 1: is the investments that we were making previous and today, and the Human Service Department, community safety programs. We have included in this proposal $3 million, as we talked about previously, to make sure that our community organizations who are showing up as alternatives to policing are are able to have funding not just for a year and a half\nSpeaker 1: , but stability for two years, which is something that we've heard directly from frontline fire responders, which is so critical for those who are experiencing mental health or behavioral health issues, a place to go. So I bring that up to underscore the importance of what is in this bill to address the pressure that we have been hearing about\nSpeaker 1: . But it is also important to put that information in context of what the data set data has been mentioned in this comment so far. So I want to emphasize what we see from the Marshall Project that led with the headline recently that said, Police say demoralized officers are quitting in droves.\nSpeaker 1: Labor Day data says no. Well, other industries were devastated by the pandemic last year. Police departments across the country, including in Seattle, saw a much smaller impact, according to federal data. Those worries were founded that U.S. economy shed 6% of workers and local police departments lost under 1% of employees.\nSpeaker 1: Now, that attrition is something that we are all working on addressing by way of the investments that we're making today, by way of the 3 million plus the 10 million that we've invested in community contracts. We are not not acting today.\nSpeaker 1: We are acting. But we have to talk about why we're acting in the way we are. We're acting the way we are with this hybrid approach to invest in community partnerships. Because we know from the National Institute of Criminal Justice Reform, the analysis of Seattle Police Department calls for services between 2017 and 19 found that of the\nSpeaker 1: 1.2 million calls for services covering that period, nearly 80% of the calls were for non-criminal events. So to me, that means it is important for us to be scaling up the non-criminal response side. That is why I think it's important to have this balanced approach that we worked on in the amendment.\nSpeaker 1: If only 6% of those calls were associated with felonies, I think that that really underscores the importance for hiring strategies, retention strategies and community oriented solutions to create stability for community alternatives to policing. That is what I think the proposal in front of us reflected.\nSpeaker 1: I'll continue to work with all of you as we work to make sure that we are addressing the stability that our community partners need so that there truly is an alternative to investing in alternatives. Lastly, I think that this.\nSpeaker 1: Policy is a policy decision that should have been discussed in more detail, either in committee or in a future committee, for the purposes of really answering the questions about how the strategy would work. Today, I would offer to you colleagues that the both investments that we're making help relieve some of that pressure that we're hearing about and\nSpeaker 1: also appropriately invest in community oriented solutions. So for those reasons today. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Mosqueda, are there any additional comments amendment being. Okay. I'm not hearing any additional comments on Amendment three B, so I'm going to go ahead and call on Councilmember Peterson for closing remarks on this amendment.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council president and colleagues, thank you for the discussion today. I remain committed to reimagining reimagining policing and revamping the police contract to provide the most effective pathways to community safety. But I believe that includes a combination of strategies, and that includes not only our increased investments in upstream human services programs and alternatives, alternative responses, but\nSpeaker 2: also acknowledging the staffing crisis. We've known about the staffing crisis for months. I agree it should have been discussed earlier, and I believe that we've got an obligation on city charter to provide adequate police protection in all districts.\nSpeaker 2: So we need to do both. And I think we can and I look forward to the vote on this and further discussions in the future. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, will a quick please.\nSpeaker 1: Call the roll.\nSpeaker 0: Call of Amendment Three?\nSpeaker 1: Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Sir. What?\nSpeaker 5: No.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Her bold. I know. Suarez.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 1: Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Morales. Now. Macheda now. President Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 0: No.\nSpeaker 1: Four in favor, five opposed.\nSpeaker 0: The motion fails and the amendment is not adopted. I believe we have another amendment and this one is sponsored by Councilmember Mesquita. I'm going to hand it over to you to make your motion.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. And Councilmember Herbold, appreciate your leadership on this as well. Colleagues, I move to amend Council Bill 1 to 0 112 as presented on amendment number four on the agenda that.\nSpeaker 0: It's been moved and seconded by Councilmember Herbold to amend the bill as presented on Amendment four. I'm going to hand it back over to councilmembers to walk us through the amendment.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much, colleagues. We are bringing this amendment forward to you after it being drawn to our attention from first responders at the fire department who are on the front line. That the triage response proposal was a step forward.\nSpeaker 1: But the best use of our limited resources responding to noncriminal 911 calls is to make sure that we have a place to send folks. We don't want there to be a triage unit that gets deployed and then not to have a landing place for folks.\nSpeaker 1: And we also know that there's much work in the pipeline thanks to Councilmember Purple leadership, to create a protocol system that is currently being designed as well. We want to make sure that that protocol system is truly fleshed out so that we don't have a system that ends up referring folks to an emergency room or seeks housing\nSpeaker 1: and shelter or medical services when there isn't capacity to receive them. We know that much of our shelter services, including the most recent data that we got last Thursday when meeting with Lead and Reach, folks show that there was only five beds available for the entire night.\nSpeaker 1: For all of the folks who are experiencing homelessness out there and the intent of the trail system is well-received. We also just need to make sure that that protocol system is aligned with making sure that there is a place to go for those who get visited by the triage team.\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate the work on this. And again, thanks to ATF Local 27 for their thoughtful approach to this Councilmember Herbold, for her leadership and co-sponsorship on this, and to central staff and the team who has helped create this proposal in front of us, we all want a complete response protocol that at a minimum identifies confirmed service providers\nSpeaker 1: , case managers, health, mental health providers and support systems to make sure that folks are getting the care that they need after that call is made. So looking forward to learning more from that complete protocol system. And the proposal under this amendment will be lifted when that report is submitted to Council to Councilmember Health Committee.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Councilmember Herbold, I see that you have your hand raised, please.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Yes. Real quickly, I just want to flag that this amendment and proviso is not in any way intended to slow down the launching of the proposed cash program. As soon as authorizations and operations are approved and after the establishment of the protocol system, that will make it possible for the Community Safety and Communications Center to\nSpeaker 3: dispatch a response to the sort of right size the dispatch, and ensure that they are sending the right person to the either the one on this check or the person on call as proposed by the by the triage one program.\nSpeaker 3: This amendment also flags another. It's a discussion that that we're having in the city right now about where the staff for the for the trash programs should be housed. There is some interest in having that be housed out of the Seattle Fire Department.\nSpeaker 3: I just want to remind counsel that the other vision for the Community Safety and Communication Center is broader than just a new department to house dispatch functions. And we recently made the decision that we are not going to house parking enforcement officers within the new Community Service Communications Center, despite our our intention, our stated intention to do\nSpeaker 3: so legislatively last year. We made a different decision a couple of weeks ago. I want to flag that this amendment parks these dollars, the dollars that are for staff in finance general, while we continue the discussion of whether or not these bodies should be housed in the fire department or in New DC and flagging, if we if\nSpeaker 3: we make the decision to not have the triaged one pilot program and the staff beat the staff of Ccxi, we may be deciding to to minimize the foot print of the CSC CC to become more than a dispatch function.\nSpeaker 3: So just want to just want to flag that we have asked Seattle Fire Department and the FCC for information about the pilot startup aims under both scenarios. And we have heard from the Budget Office do not believe that leaving Ridge one in CSC you see would delay implementation, would require additional resources.\nSpeaker 3: And so I look forward to sharing with the rest of the council information I receive from Chief Scoggins, as well as Director Lombard, about those projects up times for stage one under both scenarios. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Are there any additional comments on Amendment four? All right, customers get it. Anything else to add? There's a dance party unfolding in my living room. So sorry about that. Hope you guys all like the Rio soundtrack.\nSpeaker 0: With that being said, will the third place play a role in the passage of Amendment four?\nSpeaker 2: Peterson Yes.\nSpeaker 1: So what?\nSpeaker 5: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Herbold. Yes. Suarez I. Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Morales. Yes. Mosqueda. President Gonzalez I nine in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 0: All right. The motion carries, the amendment is adopted and the bill is before the council. We do have one additional amendment to consider, and that is council members, the wants amendment. So consumers want to hand it over to you to make your motion to get the amendment before us.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. President Gonzalez I move to amend Council Bill 1 to 0 112 as presented on Amendment five, which was recently distributed, which cuts $2.41 million from the SPV and adds that $2.4 million to the supporting Safe Communities Fund in a just second.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. The amendment has been moved and seconded so many. Hand it back over to you. Council members want to walk us through the amendment.\nSpeaker 5: Many of the comments that I made earlier, they remain valid for this one as well in terms of why this amendment is very important. And we know that last year the city council placed provisos on $7.5 million in the city budget for this year in response to the demand from the Justice for George Floyd movement last year\nSpeaker 5: to reduce the spending on repressive military policing and to instead invest in building and supporting communities, which, in my view, as I said in briefing, I think is the least that the city council should be doing. This supplemental budget, the supplemental budget as a whole removes the provisos, essentially freeing up an additional $7.5 million in the police\nSpeaker 5: budget and only transferring part of those funds to other departments. $2.41 million is the remainder of the balance that this amendment addresses. And as I informed the city council this morning, this budget amendment is in response to the request from the activist of Decriminalize Seattle to transfer the Seattle Police Department salary savings into community funding as the\nSpeaker 5: Council member committed to do last November. And I hope that council members would support it, especially keeping in mind the powerful public testimonials that were provided by activists, ordinary people, community members, including medical professionals, as to why this is important.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Customers want are there any additional comments on Amendment five? I see that Councilmember Morales.\nSpeaker 1: Has her hand raised, so please.\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Council President So I am going to support this amendment. And as as we've all been saying, it's for me, it's for a couple of reasons. During our deliberations last year, the council worked with Community. Our office worked very hard with community to begin investing in a new ecosystem, a community safety ecosystem that really acknowledges humanity\nSpeaker 6: . Our residents, particularly for black and brown people. So I think we made a lot of strides. We've created a new division within each city to look at, particularly invest how we invest in community organizations that have alternative options for what community safety could be.\nSpeaker 6: And we've come a long way in beginning to repair the harm done to our communities, just acknowledging that need by setting up these systems and creating some initial investment, that if we're going to have the outcomes that we seek, we really need to commit to the kind of investment that it will take to change the community conditions\nSpeaker 6: that lead community safety challenges. And I think also Member Lewis earlier laid out a lot of those programs and the efforts that we have begun, but we aren't nearly done that work. And as several folks have said, the investments that we've made are our short term.\nSpeaker 6: We really need to be looking at how to invest in the sustainable ways that those organizations can scale up and can really have the kind of outcomes we're talking about. And so that's one thing I'm interested in. The other, though, is that as the fiscal body for the city, our budgetary and policy decisions are just that.\nSpeaker 6: They are decisions for the legislative body, and that is our role. These aren't permissive. They aren't suggestions to the department. The appropriation authority that is given to the departments are guardrails. We we we have a check and balance system, the executive authority and this isn't theoretical, something that's codified in state law.\nSpeaker 6: So I think it's important to remember that we're in this position in part because of an intentional overspend on overtime last year and on several other things. And it's important to recognize that public officials are not allowed to willfully overspend their budget.\nSpeaker 6: Our state values fiscal responsibility, such that over expenditure can result in a misdemeanor. So I think it's important for us as we continue this conversation, and particularly as we move into budget conversations in the fall, that as a deliberative body, we make a decision on rebalance today on the appropriation.\nSpeaker 6: This isn't something that should just be cured. Overspend shouldn't just be cured by exceptions later. So I hope that as we move into the fall discussion and into next year's budget, that we continue to support thoughtful process for community investment and that we really commit to holding a speedy, accountable to appropriation in the future as we do\nSpeaker 6: every other department. They have to perform within their authority in order to serve the city best. And I just want to to encourage all of us to keep that in mind as we continue this discussion and as we begin the next discussions over the next few weeks.\nSpeaker 6: So I will be supporting this amendment. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Morales, because when I see that your hand is raised as well.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you so much. As I understand it, this amendment would by cutting 0.41 million from the 2021 budget and adding 2.41 million to the Human Services Department's budget. In addition to the 3 million that the Finance and Housing Committee added to the budget from SBT, that this would basically undo 2.4 million in decisions that the committee made\nSpeaker 3: and. In our closing remarks. I'm sure we'll get into that and how those investments support community safety. I simply can't support boiling point $4 million off of work we have painstakingly done in in. In Finance, in Budget Committee, without knowing specifically of approximately $15 million of the segments where those dollars would come from.\nSpeaker 3: In addition, if the amendment were asked, it's very likely that SPD will request additional creation authority from the Council later in 2021 to pay for some of the expenses that we have agreed in the bill coming out of committee that we should pay.\nSpeaker 3: And as I mentioned before, it's a high priority of mine to work with the executive to identify what spending priorities are shared between the executive and the Council and to grant that authority. Other than renewing a scenario where they they fund their priorities and ask us for permission to to to backfill those expenses after the fact.\nSpeaker 3: And then Ellie is unclear. You know, one of the provisos lifted is a $550,000 proviso that restricted funds and PPE. And a report on Harbor Patrol Services report was sent in June and lifts the proviso as a matter matter, and I'm not sure that this was considered I amendment sponsor in the calculations of the amount be cut\nSpeaker 3: for speedy. So again there's a lot of me there's a lot of uncertainty about where these dollars would come and how that would intersect with the decisions that we already made in committee. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold. Okay. Any other comments on Amendment five? Not seeing any additional hands raised comes customers want you're the sponsor this amendment so you get the last word.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I'm not sure I understood exactly what Councilmember Herbold was saying. And forgive me if I'm Miss Mis mistaking what was said. But just to be clear, the amendment that I've put forward does not touch the Highway Patrol proviso funds.\nSpeaker 5: And, um, and I believe also Councilmember Herbold said something to the effect. I mean, I'm not putting you in paraphrasing you that, that if the Council does not through council passes this amendment, then SBT will come back anyway to ask for more.\nSpeaker 5: Well, of course, they will do so anyway. Obviously, that that's been the practice, but this amendment comes from precinct budgets. Just to be clear. And so I'm not sure that that should be a problem, really. And it is.\nSpeaker 5: It is. It is. It should be. I mean, I'll tell you this, it should be completely possible for the police department to do their work without these $2.41 million. So I would really urge the Council to support the amendment.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you so much. Councilmember So once I did make a call for last comments, but I think I heard Converse wasn't asking for clarification from Councilmember Herbold. So Councilmember, did you want an opportunity to respond? And of course, consumers want if you want to have the last, last word you are will be entitled to due to\nSpeaker 0: have that right under the council.\nSpeaker 3: And we're under my clarification. I have to make as I'm reading from the simple staff memo, I think.\nSpeaker 0: Because there isn't anything else to add that closes out.\nSpeaker 5: No.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, great. Well, thank you so much. Appreciate that. Okay, colleagues, I'm not seeing any additional hands raised or anyone waving at their camera to get my attention here. So we're going to go ahead and conclude debate and call the roll on this.\nSpeaker 0: So will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of Amendment five?\nSpeaker 2: Peterson No.\nSpeaker 1: Sergeant.\nSpeaker 5: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: STROUSE No.\nSpeaker 3: Per bolt? No.\nSpeaker 1: Juarez? No.\nSpeaker 2: LEWIS No.\nSpeaker 1: Morales As. Most clever, though. President Gonzalez now two in favor, seven opposed.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. The motion. Passive and sorry. The motion fails. I'm looking for the language. Motion fails and the amendment is not adopted. Are there any further comments on the bill as amended? Councilmember, do you have your hand?\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you so much. I just would like to make some comments on the overall bill that I've been I've been holding as we go through the amendments. I want to really thank our housing and finance chair, councilmember mosqueda for her clobber on this legislation.\nSpeaker 3: The amendments regarding the Seattle Police Department budget up the committee show strong commitment to addressing the officer shortage by reducing the workload on sworn officers who have stayed with Seattle, as well as implementing as well as supporting implementation of alternative funding in this bill, or speed for the community service officers and crime prevention coordinators.\nSpeaker 3: There's funding for SPV, for hiring process accelerators for both sworn officers and civilian hires. There is funding for the nine on one call data analysis that we have received from the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform. Support Reimagining Policing.\nSpeaker 3: There is funding for the work, scheduling and timekeeping project so important aiding in modernizing spd's management of our time and as well as management of off duty work and addressing the recommendations by the City Audit are in 2016 and recommendations recently made by the Office of Police Accountability 1.5 million.\nSpeaker 3: For over time, SPD stood 3 million. Both the Mayor and council opposed reductions for in the overtime budget. Well, actually, I should probably not mention the 1.5 million for overtime because I think we've made it an amendment. Take some of the money of the 1.5 million in overtime out of the budget.\nSpeaker 3: So that is an issue that we might need to take up. And since additional events are now taking place, more overtime ending may be needed. We've now scooped that extra funding for the initial action around our retention and recruitment services.\nSpeaker 3: Nine SPV funding that is included in this bill, but that is still so important to community safety. Is funding for phase one, both funding for the program, the bodies themselves to do the response. But also as we've talked about the patch protocols funding or the regional peacekeepers collect of this is so important right now.\nSpeaker 3: Community violence intervention programs such as the Regional Peacekeepers Collective have been shown to reduce violence by as much as 60%. The mayor had proposed funding that in the 2020 budget and I'm really glad we are today making a down payment on it in 2021.\nSpeaker 3: And then finally, two other items, one related to recommendations from the inspector general, that is, funding for evidence storage space. We are at capacity for the storage of critical evidence that's necessary for for our ability to pursue charges against offenders.\nSpeaker 3: And that could be everything from cars to actual other types of of of evidence. And then finally, funding for additional disclosure work as recommended by the city auditor. Many of these items, not all of them, but many of them are priorities that I had in the spring.\nSpeaker 3: And then I had proposed funding for in a speedy budget, but did not ask. And so I'm really, again, dazed and grateful that Chair Mosqueda, within the context of the mid-year supplemental, has provided the opportunity to discuss those those important priorities and investments.\nSpeaker 3: Again.\nSpeaker 4: The.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember.\nSpeaker 0: Herbold. Excuse me. I do see that Councilor Roslyn has her hand raised. So because we're.\nSpeaker 5: Just making sure this is the time to make general comment and supplemental budget.\nSpeaker 0: Yep. This is the time for general comments on the bill as amended. We don't have any more amendments, so this is your opportunity to make comments about the bill before we vote on the bill, isn't it?\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I will be voting no on the supplemental budget, which, as we just saw, has been used by the political establishment as a vehicle to increase the funding available in the bloated police budget by 2.4 million $1 million by reversing $7.5 million in provisos that were won by the Black Lives Matter movement last year.\nSpeaker 5: As I have said during budget votes for the past nearly eight years now a budget is a moral document, and this budget continues to betray the victories of the Black Lives Matter movement. As several people mentioned in public comment spree flagrantly wastes public resources.\nSpeaker 5: And this is on top of the fact that they have an already bloated police budget. Just look at their spending of over $2 million on Accenture, which, in addition to other various suits and fraud cases, has been listed.\nSpeaker 5: Accenture as a corporation has been listed in the federal contractor misconduct database nine times since 1995, with $124.2 million in penalties. That contract alone is almost enough to fund two tiny house villages for a year in what was being spent on Accenture.\nSpeaker 5: That's just a small factoid in the overall story of how much wrongdoing there is in relation to the police department. However, before I close, just like in previous budget votes, even though I have voted no on the budget as a whole because it has not lived up to being a genuine moral document, standing up for the needs\nSpeaker 5: of working people, oppressed communities and the poor. I do want to highlight what has been won by grassroots organizing the work of my office and the people's budget movement. Particularly, I want to acknowledge the work of all the Garfield Super BLOCK activists who worked with my office to successfully win funding to make the Garfield Super BLOCK proposal\nSpeaker 5: shovel ready after a decade of delays. The Garfield Super BLOCK canvass comprises the Garfield Community Center, Medgar Evers pool, the tennis court, an adjoining Garfield Park, including the historic Garfield Ballfields, the Teen Life Center, the Quincy Jones Performing Arts Center and Garfield High School and Track and Field.\nSpeaker 5: The $500,000 in funding now included in the supplemental budget bill will complete pre-development work for this project. Allow it to be shovel ready in 2022. The Garfield Super BLOCK is a grassroots effort to create a vital civic space that honors and tells the story through art and cultural representations of the people who have lived here over the\nSpeaker 5: millennia, from the Amish people to black Americans today. The Garfield Super BLOCK, working with staff from the Parks and Recreation Department, aims to enhance the area around the Garfield Community Center, the McGovern School under Garfield High School with art that celebrates the area's history with new trees and walkways to ensure access for all.\nSpeaker 5: New, safe, publicly accessible bathroom facilities and other urgently needed community amenities. And it is precisely the kind of public project that should be funded in neighborhoods like the Central District. When completed, undoubtedly this will be a community gem and will be greatly valued.\nSpeaker 5: Unfortunately, like many such project in working class communities of color, the city had loved the Super BLOCK unfunded for over 15 years. And so this is exciting that it is starting to come to fruition. After that, over the last three months, my council office has worked closely alongside the Garfield superbug activists to organize working people support for\nSpeaker 5: this project. Among more than 600 community members signed our community petition and wrote letters to council members, and dozens of people spoke up in public testimony. And organizers worked with our office to organize a public event at Garfield Community Center, where community members learn much more about the project.\nSpeaker 5: And really, it wasn't even I was there myself. It was an event that really brought the community together, especially in the time of isolation because of the pandemic. Winning this funding is an important victory for the Central District and is entirely the result of organizing and activism of ordinary people.\nSpeaker 5: In two weeks, the City Council will begin discussing the city budget for the next year. The lessons from this supplemental budget vote today is that we can win transformative victories if we have powerful people's budget movement work, which we have seen year after year, yield many victories for art, for working people.\nSpeaker 5: Or we can have our communities continue to fall further and further behind if we do not have a movement. It all will depend, as always, on organizing and movement building. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Swann, for those comments. Are there any additional comments on the bill as amended? I'm not seeing any hands raised. So we're going to go ahead and close that debate by having council members get to make closing remarks.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. President just wanted to say thanks to the Vice chair for her complete summary and accurate summary. And also to note that it is actually a reduction of 5 million to SDD, not an increase of 2 million.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Vice Chair for summarizing. So completely no additional comments for me.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. That does conclude debate on this particular council bill. So I'm going to ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the amended bill. Go ahead, Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: Gets.\nSpeaker 1: To want?\nSpeaker 5: No.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss. It's purple. Yes. Paris, I. Louis?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Let's get that. I. Morales yes.

Thank you, Mr. Motor Mauka, and thank you, Mayor and Council. We are prepared tonight to provide a presentation on the Adult Use Cannabis Ordinance and recommend related recommendations based upon Council direction given back in\nSpeaker 2: November of 2017. We're going to jump right into the presentation. Our cannabis program manager, AJ Cleary, is going to lead us through this presentation tonight. I want to first recognize, before I turn it over to AJ, that this has been a significant interdepartmental effort with multiple stakeholders, stakeholders engaged in the process and to arrive at the recommendations\nSpeaker 2: that we're making tonight. And we have spent quite a bit of time working with the city attorney's office to come to the conclusion that we will make it tonight. And so with that said, I want to turn it over to AJ to lead us through the presentation.\nSpeaker 2: And yeah, go ahead.\nSpeaker 7: Mayor and members of the City Council. Council. I'm here to provide a presentation on the Adult Use Cannabis Ordinance prepared at the request of the City Council. The ordinance was drafted by the City Attorney's Office in close coordination with the city manager's office and other departments involved in regulating the cannabis industry.\nSpeaker 7: Before getting into adult use. I want to provide a quick update on the medical cannabis market in Long Beach. As of June 1st, the city has licensed 12 medical cannabis businesses. This includes nine dispensaries, one cultivator, one manufacturer and one testing laboratory.\nSpeaker 7: In addition to the licensed facilities, there are 259 businesses in the process of obtaining a medical cannabis license. However, what we've learned from other states like Colorado and Washington is that the business startup failure rate in the cannabis industry is high, so it's difficult to predict how many of these pending businesses will actually open.\nSpeaker 7: To help frame the discussion, I'd like to briefly run through the recent history of cannabis in California. Starting in 2015, the state legislature approved a series of bills to authorize commercial medical cannabis activity throughout the state. Soon after, in 2016, voters, California voters took it a step further by approving Proposition 64, which authorized statewide commercial adult use\nSpeaker 7: cannabis activity. Those bills were eventually merged into a single act known as the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, which remains in effect today under the MSU CRC, Medical and Adult Use. Cannabis businesses are only authorized to operate in cities that allow commercial cannabis activity within their jurisdictions.\nSpeaker 7: Which brings us to Long Beach. In November 2016, Long Beach voters approved measure M-hm. A voter driven ballot initiative which authorized medical cannabis businesses to operate locally. Because Measure MM dealt only with medical cannabis. The city maintained an implicit ban on the adult use cannabis market.\nSpeaker 7: Fast forward one year to November 2017. The Long Beach City Council directed staff to begin working on an ordinance to authorize commercial adult use cannabis locally. As part of that request. The City Council specifically directed staff to include a social equity program in the Adult Use Ordinance, which will be discussed later in this presentation in order to\nSpeaker 7: provide adequate time to prepare the draft ordinance. The City Council also approved a 180 day temporary ban on adult use cannabis businesses. The 180 day ban has ended. So today we are presenting a draft of the Adult Use Ordinance for City Council consideration.\nSpeaker 7: In preparing the proposed ordinance, staff staff drew from a wide range of resources. First city departments submitted policy recommendations to the city manager's office for consideration in the Adult Use Ordinance. These policy recommendations were based on recent experience with regulating the medical cannabis industry in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 7: Next, the city attorney's office spent considerable time researching cannabis ordinances approved in other jurisdictions throughout California, as well as other states. Staff from the city manager's office also attended numerous neighborhood and industry meetings to hear the community's thoughts and concerns about cannabis.\nSpeaker 7: And finally, staff fielded hundreds of direct calls and emails over the past year through the dedicated Long Beach cannabis hotline and email address. With that, I'd like to go through some of the key provisions that have been included in the Adult Use Ordinance.\nSpeaker 7: First, co-location co-location means permitting adult use and medical cannabis activity on the same premise. The Adult Use Ordinance will require co-location for dispensaries. In other words, only the existing medical dispensaries will be authorized to apply for an adult use dispensary license and only from their current location.\nSpeaker 7: Unlike dispensaries, co-location will be optional for non dispensaries. Non dispensary businesses include cultivators, manufacturers, testing laboratories and distributors. These business types will have the ability to apply for a medical license, an adult use license or both licenses from the same facility.\nSpeaker 7: Businesses that apply for an adult use license will be subject to the requirements of the Adult Use Ordinance, identified as Chapter 5.92 of the Long Beach Municipal Code. Next, the ordinance sets restrictions on where adult use cannabis businesses can locate.\nSpeaker 7: It does this in two key ways. First, the ordinance establishes minimum buffer distances between adult use businesses and sensitive uses such as schools, beaches, parks, libraries and daycare centers. Specifically, buffer distances are a thousand feet from schools and beaches and 600 feet from parks, libraries and daycare centers.\nSpeaker 7: The proposed buffer distances are the same for adult use as they are for medical cannabis facilities. Second, the Adult Use Ordinance Amends Title 21 of the Long Beach Municipal Code to add cannabis use types to the city's zoning tables.\nSpeaker 7: In doing so, the city will ensure that moving forward, cannabis businesses locate around other appropriately zoned uses. For instance, industrial use types such as cultivators, manufacturers and distributors will be restricted to industrial zones of the city. Retail uses, including dispensaries, will be permitted in commercial or industrial zones of the city.\nSpeaker 7: In other words, Title 21 will treat cannabis facilities like any other similar use type in the city. The purpose but with one exemption and that is that existing medical cannabis businesses will be authorized to apply for an adult use license from their existing location regardless of the new zoning requirements.\nSpeaker 7: The reason for the exemption is to recognize that many medical cannabis applicants have made significant investments in their properties based on previous location requirements. Without this exemption, a significant number of medical cannabis businesses will be forced to remain medical cannabis, only placing them at a significant disadvantage in the cannabis market.\nSpeaker 7: Staff added a number of new public health provisions to the Adult Use Ordinance. First adult use businesses will be required to obtain a public health permit prior to operation. The permit will grant the city's health officer the authority to protect the health and safety of cannabis consumers and employees.\nSpeaker 7: Specifically, the health permit authorizes the health officer to conduct random quality assurance testing of cannabis goods and force packaging. Labeling and product storage requirements. Exclude employees diagnosed with an illness from handling cannabis goods, ensure basic sanitation of cannabis facilities and take other necessary precautions.\nSpeaker 7: The ordinance also authorizes the Long Beach Health Department to establish a responsible cannabis vendor program. The participation in the program will be mandatory for all new managers and employees of adult use dispensaries. Training topics will include cannabis, public health issues such as preventing youth access, risks of driving under the influence, proper methods for safe storage of cannabis\nSpeaker 7: goods and other important health related material. The ordinance also sets minimum security requirements for adult use cannabis facilities. Businesses will be required to maintain 24 hour onsite video surveillance, install security alarm systems and are monitored by a security company 24 hours a day.\nSpeaker 7: Hire security personnel, utilize electronic age verification devices to confirm proof of customer age and provide employee ID badges for use during business operation transportation or delivery of cannabis goods. Violations of the ordinance may be enforced by the city using various administrative, civil and criminal remedies.\nSpeaker 7: Specifically, this includes administrative holds on cannabis products, permit suspensions and revocations, administrative citations, civil penalties and criminal penalties. The multifaceted approach to enforcement will allow the city to tailor enforcement actions to the nature of each violation. In addition, the draft ordinance grants the city access to security camera recordings from businesses upon request.\nSpeaker 7: Access to security footage will allow the city to fully investigate community complaints about cannabis businesses. Finally, the appeals process for penalties, suspensions or revocations of adult use cannabis permits will follow the standard procedures for other non cannabis businesses in the city.\nSpeaker 7: That means appeals will be heard by a hearing officer referred by the city clerk. The ordinance also grants the city full authority to charge fees to offset the cost of licensing and regulating adult use cannabis businesses. If the City Council moves to approve an adult use ordinance, staff will return to the City Council with proposed changes to\nSpeaker 7: the master fee and charges schedule to establish new fees for the adult use cannabis industry. Proposed fees will include an annual regulatory fee, fire permit fee, health permit fee and tax audit fee, as well as one time fees for application review and criminal background investigations without establishing new fees.\nSpeaker 7: The General Fund will be forced to subsidize adult use cannabis regulatory activities. On this next slide, you'll see projected fy19 cannabis tax revenues for the medical cannabis market staff projects a potential increase of up to $750,000 in Fy19 general fund tax revenues from authorization of commercial adult use cannabis.\nSpeaker 7: Bear in mind, though, that cannabis tax revenues are incredibly difficult to predict. For example, so far in FY 18, the city has collected significantly less in cannabis tax revenues than originally budgeted for this year. For this reason, we do not recommend budgeting any increase in business license tax revenues for the adult use market at this time.\nSpeaker 7: Staff will revisit cannabis revenue projections during the FY19 budget development process. That concludes the first part of my presentation. And now I'd like to go over the cannabis social equity program. As part of the request for an adult use ordinance, City Council directed staff to consider social equity policies to include in the proposed regulations.\nSpeaker 7: Based on this direction, the Office of Cannabis Oversight works with the Long Beach Equity Office and the Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network to develop recommendations on a cannabis equity program. The first step in this process was to research cannabis equity programs approved by other cities.\nSpeaker 7: What we discovered through this research is that social equity has become a core focus of cannabis policymaking. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento and Oakland have all approved cannabis equity ordinances. State legislatures have also begun to develop cannabis social equity programs, including Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nSpeaker 7: In December of 2017, Massachusetts passed the first statewide cannabis social equity program. Recently, the California State Senate began considering SB 1294 a bill to create a cannabis equity program for all of California across these states and local jurisdictions.\nSpeaker 7: A consistent framework has begun to develop around cannabis equity policy. This framework involves defining who is eligible for the program, establishing program benefits, and designing a process to encourage partnership between businesses and low income residents. The goal of cannabis social equity is to recognize the impact that federal and state cannabis enforcement policies have had on low income\nSpeaker 7: communities across the country. Specifically, low income communities have experienced a greater number of arrests and convictions for low level offenses such as cannabis use and possession. Despite similar cannabis cannabis usage rates relative to other groups, a cannabis conviction can lead to permanent loss of property, disqualification from employment opportunities, reduced earnings, potential exclusion from public benefits such as\nSpeaker 7: housing assistance or student financial aid, and other negative consequences. Recognizing this fact. California voters or California residents voted to decriminalize cannabis activity at the state and local level. However, many cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento have taken this a step further by adopting cannabis social equity programs.\nSpeaker 7: These programs are meant to support economic inclusion in the cannabis industry for industry, for individuals who may have been negatively impacted by federal and state cannabis enforcement policies in the past. The first step is to define who should be eligible for the cannabis equity program.\nSpeaker 7: Other cities have consistently used income, geography and prior cannabis arrests as eligibility criteria. We are recommending the same for Long Beach. First, a person must be low to moderate income to qualify for the program. This is defined as having an annual family income at or below 80% of the area median income.\nSpeaker 7: By establishing income limits, the city will be able to target program eligibility to those individuals with the greatest need for assistance. Next, an individual must meet at least one of the following two criteria. Either was previously arrested or convicted for a low level cannabis related crime in Long Beach that could have been prosecuted as a misdemeanor or\nSpeaker 7: a citation under current California law, or lived in a low to moderate income census tracts in Long Beach for a minimum of three years. The arrest criteria is meant to identify individuals who are directly impacted by the enforcement of laws that have mostly been decriminalized at the state and local level.\nSpeaker 7: The census tract criteria is meant to identify residents from disadvantaged neighborhoods whose communities have experienced the disproportionate burden of cannabis criminalization and enforcement. For individuals who qualify for the equity program, staff recommends providing two categories of benefits. The first category is direct business assistance.\nSpeaker 7: Business assistance for equity applicants includes fee waivers, expedited application review, expedited plan check, business license, tax deferrals and application workshops to help navigate the process. In addition, the Office of Equity will coordinate a fresh start clinics to help individuals previously convicted of a cannabis related offense, petition a judge to have their convictions reclassified, expunged or dismissed.\nSpeaker 7: Finally, we created an incubator program to help encourage partnership between established cannabis businesses and equity applicants. The incubator program requires businesses that do not qualify for the equity program to submit a plan to the city detailing how they intend to support equity applicants.\nSpeaker 7: Incubator plans will be published and made available to equity applicants seeking additional support. The second cat. Excuse me. The second category involves employment opportunities. Staff has proposed a 25% equity employee hire requirement for all cannabis businesses to meet this requirement.\nSpeaker 7: A cannabis business must ensure that at least 25% of annual business work hours are performed by employees who are eligible for the cannabis equity program. A similar percentage requirement has been adopted by the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento.\nSpeaker 7: Businesses that fail to meet the 25 threshold may still satisfy the requirement if they show a good faith effort to hire equity employees. The equity hire requirement will be overseen by the Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network by advertising the program.\nSpeaker 7: Registering individuals interested in the program. Confirming employee eligibility. Connecting equity employees with businesses. And monitoring businesses for compliance with support from Pacific Gateway. We believe that the 25% requirement is an achievable standard for all cannabis businesses to meet and will expand, extend the benefits of the equity program to a much larger population within the Long Beach community\nSpeaker 7: . In addition, the ordinance requires all adult use cannabis businesses to enter into a labor peace agreement with a labor union that represents cannabis workers in Long Beach. This requirement is consistent with the labor provision provision that voters approved for medical cannabis businesses through a measure aimed.\nSpeaker 7: Staff estimates a one time cost of 266,000 to develop the cannabis social equity program. The one time cost is anticipated to be offset by citywide budget savings in excess of established departments. General Fund Savings Targets in FY 18.\nSpeaker 7: The one time cost includes 200,000 for Pacific Gateway to establish the 25% equity hire program, 50,000 for development services to offset the cost of providing automatic expedited plan checks for equity applicants and 16,000 for the equity office to coordinate the Fresh Start programs.\nSpeaker 2: From ongoing.\nSpeaker 7: Costs related to the Pacific Gateway, 25% higher program will be offset through an equity hire fee charged to adult use cannabis businesses. Establishment of the fee will be requested through proposed changes to the master fee and charges schedule following passage of an adult use ordinance.\nSpeaker 1: Going to be.\nSpeaker 7: This slide outlines next steps for the overall adult use ordinance. The temporary moratorium on commercial adult use cannabis activities has expired. Regardless of this expiration, the city maintains an implicit ban on commercial adult use cannabis activity through its permissive zoning laws.\nSpeaker 7: This implicit ban will only be lifted upon approval of a commercial adult use ordinance by the City Council. Absent this approval, staff will continue to deny applications for adult use cannabis business licenses in Long Beach. Should the City Council adopt the proposed ordinance?\nSpeaker 7: Staff estimates that adult use cannabis sales from licensed Long Beach dispensaries could begin as early as August 2018. That concludes my presentation and I'm available for questions.\nSpeaker 2: Stay safe. Thank you. And so we'll go to public comment. At this point, any member of the public want to address the city council and I'll be the time.\nSpeaker 8: Very good. You. Kirk has the address. As I stated before, if the city is forced to have cannabis.\nSpeaker 2: The only location that we will.\nSpeaker 8: Sell it on.\nSpeaker 1: As a the top floor, the.\nSpeaker 8: Police.\nSpeaker 2: Department, and we will rent out spaces there and the city will.\nSpeaker 1: Make money for that. However, however.\nSpeaker 2: That should only occur once the city gets stabilized. And what I mean stabilized when we have a city manager that is not a period principal individual and we have a new mayor who will shortly, I think, in the next 6 to 8 weeks, be indicted by the new US attorney who tomorrow morning and we'll be watching the\nSpeaker 2: tapes. Where the mayor last week essentially thumbed his nose and gave his middle finger to the concept that he would be going to prison together.\nSpeaker 8: With his complicit fellow travelers.\nSpeaker 2: In the raising of marine stadium to s. Period. As I pointed out before.\nSpeaker 1: There were other items that were a higher priority on the federal level.\nSpeaker 2: But once we get a new mayor, and I think that will happen probably within the next 11 months and we get.\nSpeaker 1: As city manager, that is not Peter principle.\nSpeaker 2: We might be stabilized enough.\nSpeaker 1: To allow these. But then again, the only place we should allow them is on the top floor.\nSpeaker 2: Of the police department. We'll have one for each district. And they can be open.\nSpeaker 1: Maybe from 10 to 2 in the afternoon, in the morning.\nSpeaker 2: To two in the afternoon, three days a week. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 8: Yes. Mr. Vice Mayor and council horrible land. I was Googling this morning. Personally, I really didn't know. It says only one in seven California cities allow recreational marijuana stores. And also to find out that Orange County only has, I think, maybe three stores out of 34 cities.\nSpeaker 8: And those are typically in low income areas. I like to make some suggestions. One suggestion I wish I could make would. Why in the heck are we disregarding the laws and the rule of law? That flag? And why didn't we go with the throw with the 80% of the cities that hopefully won't sell this stuff?\nSpeaker 8: I just don't get it. But I guess I do. Well, and it's going to have to happen. The elephant in the room here is not shown in any of your research, any of your slides, that nothing that is that cannabis has been recognized by the military as having a negative impact on their perception.\nSpeaker 8: And anybody in the military who drives a truck or a tank or an airplane and smokes pot, whether it's medical pot or any other kind of pot, is out because they know they hold this pot X on the brain, the highly THC part of it.\nSpeaker 8: Now the CBD, CBD. And we have not touched upon the fact that in the training that their perception dysfunction quadruples when it's mixed with alcohol. So we're going to.\nSpeaker 2: Have.\nSpeaker 1: All.\nSpeaker 2: The pot.\nSpeaker 8: People coming from Orange County through our arteries, coming in through our schools, buying the pot. And we've got a lovely place for them to come down after they smoked a few joints and have a beer, whether it's a shoreline or a sauna for sure.\nSpeaker 8: And then they go back their merry way to Orange County. So I think Orange County. So this is a quality of life issue. And I in fact, before I even knew that Orange County had so few, I asked myself the question.\nSpeaker 8: I said, who in Laguna Beach or in Newport Beach wants to have pot sales? Well, and you know who it is. Nobody anyway. Also all half the money needs to go to these kids. That that to the development we need of course, at City College or of course, it or we should avoid school district in 12th grade\nSpeaker 8: and take half the money dedicated to use activities and teaching all that. But it may be okay, but you mix well with alcohol and you're going to be possibly a dead player. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next up is vice mayor. I'm sorry. We're going to go back to public comment to let me click on public comment. Yes. We have five members of the public. Is there anyone else as to public comment before I close the speakers list?\nSpeaker 1: I have you included Francis. Okay, then the five folks that are here. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Stephanie orson. So, second district. Congratulations, stacy on your child. Parenthood is awesome. It's gonna be great. Also, in response to Mr. Goodyear's suggestion that we sell weed at the beginning, at the top of the police department, our police station chief Luna is a fine police officer, but I sincerely doubt his ability to tell me what a really\nSpeaker 2: good gram is right now. The only adult use commercial retailers are unlicensed, untaxed and are selling untested product. I posted a picture on my Facebook account from there featuring some of the product that's actually sold by somebody who delivers services.\nSpeaker 2: It's dried. Brown doesn't contain any of the helpful Terrapins that you would actually want. Really is not fit for any sort of human consumption. But it's being sold daily here with the lack of adult use licenses being offered last year.\nSpeaker 2: Adult medical businesses have served as an excellent model for future regulation. These retailers of PET that are open today have incurred zero violations for illegal underage sales. By comparison, the 7-Eleven near my house and on Orange Avenue has had its license suspended at least once a month, every month this year so far.\nSpeaker 2: Again, we we it's a brand new day today here in 2018, unlike in 2014, when I was the only stoner on the 14th floor quietly begging for my weed stores to stay open. We have state level regulatory. We have a state level regulatory framework.\nSpeaker 2: We have retail taxes, and we have the ability to use affirmative zoning laws and clear to support the clear electoral support that has been provided on this particular issue. I want to thank specifically the council and the city attorney's office for their time and concern in this man on this matter.\nSpeaker 2: Please pass it as is. In addition, I want to add a particular plank for the social equity thing to be concerned about. Right now, the district attorney's office in Los Angeles, as well as our city prosecutor's office, has the data available regarding the ratio of any particular racial disparity regarding marijuana arrests or any of the the status\nSpeaker 2: of our of people who have felonies that are felonies on their record, marijuana felonies on the record that would be eligible for expungement. In terms of data sharing, if those were provided to to advocates within this area and or frankly, just automated, I mean, I think that they're probably given the number of people are calling my office\nSpeaker 2: , they're probably a fair number of people in the city that would benefit from that. So automatic expungements for felony marijuana, felons, that's been something that's been considered on the state level and as well as been adopted by a couple of different cities throughout the state.\nSpeaker 2: It's really worth considering. Thank you and have a good day.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Counsel, for this opportunity to speak with you. I've worked with a few of you over the past year. I have spoke publicly one other time and it was after a roundabout discussion that got bloody. So I'm happy that all the previous presenters had happy things to talk about and the social equity.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm Greg Emmett. I'm part of the Go Forward group that won a license at 5630 Pacific Coast Highway. It's in the Iron Triangle and Susie Price's district. Although we've heard stories about the city being hard to work with, I got to tell you a personal experience.\nSpeaker 2: It's been great. Planning and zoning has been great and the council has been great. Very open minded. I've I come from Colorado. I moved here over a year ago. I have one licenses and 22 states. I've got a lot of a lot of history helping cities and police departments write rules and regulations, training the marijuana enforcement division\nSpeaker 2: in Colorado in my facility, teach them things to look for, things not to look for. I look forward to working with Commander Herzog in our district and having an open door policy. I think transparency is very important, especially in the marijuana industry.\nSpeaker 2: Even with people that live near or near a place, an open door policy to come in and see how it's done. Now, in Denver, Colorado, we've seen teen use drop by 11%. We've seen opiate addiction go down. Opiate deaths go down.\nSpeaker 2: We've seen veterans. I know we've been talking about military. We've seen veterans get helped tremendously overcoming post-traumatic stress disorder. I've seen children go from 300 seizures a month to three a year. So I'm a big proponent for marijuana, medical and adult use.\nSpeaker 2: Adult use. We've seen in Denver is out-of-state people coming from states that they cannot get help. Midwest states, it's illegal. They travel and spend money in our community, pay taxes. I think if you really look look at your vote tonight.\nSpeaker 2: If you vote now, it's a vote yes for all the illegal people out there. Right now, there are 64 illegal delivery companies in the city right now. I don't think necessarily if you vote yes that it means that you're you're going to be visiting the store and buying marijuana next week.\nSpeaker 2: But what it does show is that you're listening to your voters and that you are ready to get the get the dark side of marijuana out of the back alleys, get the pesticides out of the out of the product, and really provide a clean medicine for people to help their ailments.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next week, a piece.\nSpeaker 4: My name is Lewis. I'm from the fifth District. Thank you for letting me speak. I live over by Ward, the Norwalk boulevards. There is a marijuana dispensary that's been permitted to go in there. It's close to two schools and also in a residential area.\nSpeaker 4: I really don't agree with the blanket proposal you have in front of you today that says all marijuana medical dispensaries should be open to adult use. In fact, I would actually think we should look at expanding the distance of these dispensaries from school.\nSpeaker 4: There is really I don't know what due diligence this council has done to look into the adult use in other cities, for example, Seattle and Portland. I know some people on the police department up there that actually have stated there's been an increase in violent crime, theft, burglary and traffic accidents, as the gentleman said earlier, from the\nSpeaker 4: result of legalization of marijuana. So unless the city is really committed to hiring additional police to patrol our schools, our communities. I am very concerned about our children's well-being. There's a lot of children that walk home every day around these dispensaries.\nSpeaker 4: So if you make it adult use, you know there's potential for additional threats. We have enough threats of violence around our schools these days. We don't need this additional potential threat imposed by this initiative. As a representative of the city.\nSpeaker 4: You can potentially be held personally liable, responsible for harm to these children by these decisions you make today. I know I will personally, you know, look to your decision and go back to the different cities and excuse me, the different schools and take your decisions back to those who are in the schools, in school administration, and let\nSpeaker 4: them know what your decision is. I ask that you expand the distance of these dispensaries from our schools and our homes and to not convert all of these to. Dispensaries. Two adult use. I mean, we have plenty of dispensaries.\nSpeaker 4: We don't need any more, especially adult use. I ask that you please do the right thing for community, have a moral compass, and look out for our children's well-being. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Nick Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: My name is and I can say I'm a resident in the sixth district. I love this country because, you know, you can have people who advocate individualism and a right to privacy and limited government in one breath. And then in the next breath, they ask for a government, you know, imposed energy, but towards what you do in\nSpeaker 2: your household. It's very interesting. I think that this I'm in support of this bill to be passed. I think the time that we're at it is a surprise. What was that like? Was that a dog whistle coming from you?\nSpeaker 2: I'm in support of this because I love the city and I love the idea of tax revenue coming into the city, especially in regards to, you know, we recently had in the last election was a measure him or her in order to offset the the tax money that we needed for the general fund.\nSpeaker 2: So I feel like this is what the city needs. It's a it's a beautiful example of, you know, trying to work within the capitalist system that we have here. This is a this I think a lot of city governments have been looking at marijuana as a as something other than a commodity.\nSpeaker 2: This is a commodity. These bands increase the activity and the presence in the market of illicit drug cartels. And the longer you take to pass these things, the more market share, you know, drug cartels and other illegal groups maintain.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's great that we have people from Colorado and other states that have also recognized this as a legal right coming into the city. I like the idea of the Pacific Gateway. I think it should be increased.\nSpeaker 2: I think it should be more than 25%. We should incentivize these companies coming in to hire more people. And also potentially, I'm not sure the legality of what the banks situation here with carrying money come from marijuana companies.\nSpeaker 2: But if we can incentivize them or force them to hold more of their money in banks here in the city, that would also be a great way for us to bring more revenue in. And thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 4: Hey, good evening. Good evening, Mayor. Good evening, council. I definitely support the passing of the. I'm sorry. Oh, I support the passing of the recreational marijuana. However, I want us to really understand that the disparity disparities in cannabis arrests have caused hardship to the community.\nSpeaker 4: Last data that I read from 2013 that was studied over ten years showed that the African-American community is 13% of Long Beach, however, made up 46% of the arrests. The Long Beach was third only to San Diego in Los Angeles, in the state of California for cannabis arrests higher than San Jose, which is double the population.\nSpeaker 4: My concerns are we have a base for social equity, but we don't have a strong social equity piece that I think. And Mayor, you were quoted actually in an article in 2013 when those stats came out and you were very concerned, which I really appreciated about those stats because of those arrests and those disparities when you were\nSpeaker 4: vice mayor. So what I encourage us to do is we've personally sat with the Cannabis Association. I think they're an incredible association that's willing to work with businesses and community members to create a path to social equity. However, as of right now, we have a very skeletal basis.\nSpeaker 4: We have no reinvestment fund and no tax dollars going back in when states are going up to 50% investment back into youth development. I believe some of the tax dollars are used.\nSpeaker 5: In different.\nSpeaker 4: Ways, but they're not directly to social programs or services. The path to ownership is also an obstacle because there's no set amount. There is no. For example, San Francisco gives 50% of all of its permits to social equity applicants.\nSpeaker 4: My recommendation is that we have a social equity fee and that that fee is supports nonprofit foundations in those districts where that particular cannabis industry is and that we define more so the path to ownership as well as integrate more education into the social equity.\nSpeaker 4: Small businesses have a hard time opening up as it is without all of the rules and regulations. And so just sort of giving them a way in without the tools and the assistance and financing and training is an obstacle.\nSpeaker 4: So I just I just ask that if we I don't want to stop from the passing, but I really ask that we explore the social equity piece because I think this is a moment for us to to undo a lot of the wrongs.\nSpeaker 4: And I think it could build the city as a whole. So thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Mayor Councilmembers My name is.\nSpeaker 2: Matt Bellamy, Executive Vice President of Europe, CW Local 324 That represents.\nSpeaker 1: A little over 100 cannabis workers here in the city of Long Beach. I just want to stress the sense of urgency of passing this tonight. As most folks know.\nSpeaker 2: People are like leaving the city. I think 70% of the people that go into the dispensaries today think it's recreational and therefore leave. And so without passing this tonight, it really is a death sentence for these businesses and for.\nSpeaker 1: Good union jobs in the city. When we've passed contracts and workers have voted to accept contracts, some of these young folks in these shops have actually turned to us and said, you know, I'm so.\nSpeaker 2: Excited I can go home and I have the same benefits. I have a great living wage. I can tell my parents, I can move out, I can have insurance, I have a pension. I have all the things that a good job requires.\nSpeaker 1: And I think it would be extremely unfortunate if.\nSpeaker 2: We don't get this passed tonight and really let down those workers.\nSpeaker 1: Also, the potential to have great union jobs in the city with the expansion is what we're really.\nSpeaker 2: Looking to do. And I'm sure every council member here would like those good union jobs in their city.\nSpeaker 1: So again, I.\nSpeaker 2: Would ask that you move.\nSpeaker 1: Forward and pass.\nSpeaker 2: This tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And our last speaker.\nSpeaker 2: But evening, honorable mayors, city council, city attorney, city staff. My name is Adam Hijazi. I'm on the board of directors of the Long Beach Collective Association. I just wanted to share some quick notes regarding cannabis regulation. So as we all know, it's been a very complex and we've been grappling with this for about nine years at this\nSpeaker 2: point right now. You know, we've dealt with zoning. What distances? Community reinvestment efforts, job training, public education. We're also working on creating jobs and good paying jobs for that. And through our engaging with the community and hearing other leaders concerns and the municipalities concerned as well, we feel like measure and member and with the voters has been\nSpeaker 2: a compass to cannabis.\nSpeaker 7: In the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: With that being said, we understand. And some of the difficulties that came from it. But nonetheless, the measure was enacted by the voters now. City staff has worked for the last six months regarding putting an ordinance forward to move cannabis in the right direction.\nSpeaker 2: And quite frankly, the legal markets are hurting. It's not what everybody thinks it is. We're hurting every single day. And we just want to be able to compete against whatever illicit market is out there. There are there are concerns because this is such a complex issue, whether it's social injustices that's happening that I think needs to be\nSpeaker 2: addressed, whether it's how we're going to enforce against some of these deliveries and other issues that we have here in the city. But the most important thing is that we need to undo this not which is not being adult use.\nSpeaker 2: And a lot of cities around us have already moved in that direction. But more importantly, they shouldn't be the ones moving. We're the city of Long Beach, and I think we're the model and we can show what a good, solid cannabis ordinance can look like.\nSpeaker 2: So really what we ask is the ability to be able to compete. There's a lot of enforcement mechanisms that are going to be able to help. But I think with the legal markets being in the front, it will slowly defund some of these illicit market and these issues that are in our city today.\nSpeaker 2: You know, we talked about hours of operation potentially. That's state law saying 10:00 and it is what it is. Do you want to do nine? You want to do ten, whatever it is. But the bottom line is people are not going to stop buying cannabis at 8:00.\nSpeaker 2: They're either going to go to the guy down the street or they're gonna go to Wilmington or they're going to go to wherever it is that they need to go to be able to get there. So again, it's really about giving us the ability to compete with what is and it's not only about the hours of operation\nSpeaker 2: , it's really the city's support, which we have had good conversations with among our city staff and different individuals, individuals in the city that are that are getting it. We just ask city council to support us and to please support this ordinance tonight and move it forward, because there is an urgency going on here in the city.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And our last speaker assembly, Dustin Harris.\nSpeaker 4: I have put together. I'm Francis, Emily Dawson, Paris, my reside in District one, and.\nSpeaker 1: I put together a.\nSpeaker 4: Presentation for you and I have a three page document, communications for the police officer, the tenant cabin copy of which is the city attorney, Mike Mace has the entire copy of it and I'll give you an excerpt. And it speaks about the major problem is smoking marijuana.\nSpeaker 4: The bus stops on the metro platform and inside the metro line. And so when I looked at this article regarding the governor's spell and it spoke about the marijuana, the cities have a decision of yes or no, whether or not they want to have recreational marijuana.\nSpeaker 4: It's up to the city because I see that this is on the agenda. So the same mom is just looking at this as a potential moving forward on it. I am a pediatric nurse. There's copies of all these articles on the research I've done which I've given to the city clerk for the hard copies.\nSpeaker 4: Now, I've heard a lot this evening, and what a predicament you're in. We might not be sitting here today with this matter in such a fashion if when it went on the ballot there was about to have for the stay long missed vote regarding having recreational marijuana are and having.\nSpeaker 4: Medicinal dispensaries maybe had two different ballot measures. And then the voice of the people would have been main down and the one going and trying to figure out yay or nay what we're going to do about recreational marijuana and looking at the dangers of mixing marijuana, whether it's medicinal, recreational, with drugs, with alcohol.\nSpeaker 4: It's catastrophic. There's such a thing called acute marijuana intoxication. Also, it escalates problems for persons with neurodevelopmental disorders and other types of conditions. You really have a major decision you have to make this evening. I actually think that the city is not prepared to move forward on this massive amount of what you have before us.\nSpeaker 4: I'm looking at the children and the effect of it getting in their hands. I don't think what we have in place would need to have to have in place to have the city protect it. I actually think that this matter should be put on hold and we need to come back.\nSpeaker 4: The chief of police is here. You know, I've spoken about what the police have to say about it, so I don't have that much time to speak. But I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak. But I actually think that there's some major matters.\nSpeaker 4: Each one of you have opportunity to come forward to get this matter and a better fashion than what it is right now, because it's really not working out. And I think every one of you can figure out a way that we can get together and get this work out, because it can't be about the money.\nSpeaker 4: It's got to be.\nSpeaker 2: About the welfare.\nSpeaker 4: Of the city, the welfare of the children, the welfare of the people that live here. And there are cities that have banned having medicinal marijuana. And I have them listed down on here. And I have probably Beverly Hills, Glendale, Inglewood, Pasadena, West Covina and do not permit recreational marijuana.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm going to leave it to you to do the right thing. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Very much.\nSpeaker 4: Do the right thing. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: So much.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it. Okay, great. Thank you so much. So we are now going to close public comment and we're going to go to some discussion from the city council. So I'm going to have a few points I'm going to say.\nSpeaker 1: And then I might turn this over to Vice Mayor Richardson. He's got a first motion and then we'll go we'll go from there. I do want to start by saying that I think that it's important to note that there's a lot of a lot of the council has been obviously dealing with this issue for a long time\nSpeaker 1: . And I just want to be tonight and I ask also that those here that are the audience in the audience to also have a little patience there is going to be, I think, a conversation. And I think we want to make sure that we get to a place where we have something that there is approval on.\nSpeaker 1: And I want to make sure that it's going to be ideas and I know they're going to be presented. And so I just want to make sure that people know that. I mean, everyone is trying to come at this from a place of a kind of caring about the community and caring for their issue.\nSpeaker 1: I know in the past these some of these debates have not gone well, but I just ask that I ask those watching to watch what's going to happen. I think you're going to have a good conversation on an important topic.\nSpeaker 1: The second thing I want to make my position very clear, and I hope it also guides where the council goes. I think the voters have spoken on this issue multiple times. I think they, in large majorities at the California state level, passed recreational marijuana.\nSpeaker 1: In large majorities, they passed a local ordinance to support marijuana here in the city. That created the ordinance that we have and certainly at almost 70% pass the taxing mechanism that we have created here in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: And I know this mechanism well because I worked with the UFC, you and a lot of the business owners to create what was, I believe, a fair tax system for our dispensaries in Long Beach. And so. I think my like a lot of folks, views have also changed over time.\nSpeaker 1: And I do believe that it's been pretty clear that voters in California support, support not just medicinal marijuana, but also recreational marijuana. And so I'd support staff recommendation. I've made that already. I think public and clear. I think they have a proposal in front of us that is fair.\nSpeaker 1: It affirms the will of the voters. And in my opinion, it moves us to where the conversation on this is across the country. And I think if you look at most major cities, this is the conversation that that they're having.\nSpeaker 1: Now, I'm also aware that there's also concerns and and some questions from other council members. And I think those are fair. I think they should be discussed so we can come up with something that folks can can come to some consensus on.\nSpeaker 1: But I just wanted to make sure that I was clear about where I'm at. But I also respect where other folks are coming from on this issue because it's complex as well. And so with that, Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 2: Well, I wanted to just start by just saying this has been a really long conversation. I remember when I was still Neil's chief of staff and, you know, they went through a whole process and lotteries and all those things and it's developed.\nSpeaker 2: That conversation has certainly developed. I've learned, I've grown. I've seen the the voters in the state of California, the voters in Long Beach reiterate their position on this time and time again. I've learned a few things. So one thing I've learned is past experience is the best indicator of future performance.\nSpeaker 2: And every time the council has has gotten this, we haven't gotten it right. But we've tried to create a more perfect system and I think we've gotten better. The mayor mentioned Measure in May. That was, you know, the community come forward with Measure M to legalize medical marijuana and the city saw an opportunity to sort of, you\nSpeaker 2: know, of course. Correct. Put forward a balanced measure on taxes and put it forward to the voters. And the voters rewarded this and we got it right that time. I think we have an opportunity to get it right again today.\nSpeaker 2: So first, I want to thank our city staff for the presentation. I think it included a lot of the things that the council gave direction on. And that's important because we you know, I you know, the second thing I've learned is really we have a true diversity of opinion in our city and all of them are are\nSpeaker 2: valid. And we go through this process to try to create something that really works and is custom fit for Long Beach. And so six months ago, we asked staff to take a six month pause and, you know, pause everything while we go back and really dig into the recreational ordinance, evaluate how it's going to work in relation\nSpeaker 2: to the medical marijuana ordinance, consider opportunities to craft, you know, some, you know, take a look at what we're doing around social equity. And we had a presentation from National League of Cities and we took a look at what city other cities are doing to make sure that that's sort of central, central theme in this ordinance.\nSpeaker 2: And since then, the city manager's office, the Office of Equity, City Attorney's Office, I just want to say, I think they've done a fantastic job at bringing a well-thought out ordinance to city council. So I want to just say thank you to the entire team that worked on that.\nSpeaker 2: I really respect the work that you did on this. And just to be crystal clear, I support staff's recommendation. And so so I think that there are some elements I want to focus for a minute on the social equity piece.\nSpeaker 2: I think the city has made a constant conversation and began to grapple with this conversation around equity and and economic inclusion. And I think that the economic inclusion elements here are consistent with our blueprint for economic development, consistent with our EVERYONE initiative, and is consistent with the values of what the things that the Council has supported and\nSpeaker 2: has begun to support even more in recent years. So I want to highlight that. So a few things, a1a few things I want to call out. So one, it provides opportunities for local Long Beach residents to begin to own their own businesses in a new emerging industry.\nSpeaker 2: I think that shouldn't be. I think that should not be understated. I think secondly, it provides support for local entrepreneurs as they begin this this this journey, this process that could be confusing for many people, this process of a brand new emerging industry to provide support it it installed it creates a process fresh start clinics to ensure\nSpeaker 2: that we're providing opportunities and second chances for by peop for people impacted by drug enforcement policies prior to the legalization of cannabis. So I really want to call out the Fresh Start clinics. I think it's a good idea.\nSpeaker 2: This ordinance has opportunities for quality family supporting union jobs for local residents. I think that is something that can't be understated as businesses open. There is there's a requirement here for quality union jobs that support families. So this is a this is a great start.\nSpeaker 2: And as I mentioned, you know, past experience is the best indicator of future performance. This is a council driven ordinance. So we can always come back, make additions, tweak it, evaluate it and make changes. We can always do that.\nSpeaker 2: And so so I applaud I applaud the work that's been done. So I'm going to make make a make a motion here. But I want to just clarify two points that I'm going to I'm going to mention. So, one, there was significant interest on behalf on the part of the people in the community and on the local\nSpeaker 2: hire goal at 25%. Now we have a project labor agreement with a goal of 40%. I think that we should set we should aim high to hit our mark. I think we should aim for a 40% goal. So I'm going to make a recommendation to move forward with staff's recommendation, but make an adjustment for 25% to 40%\nSpeaker 2: . And secondly, I want to clarify some language I know that we've talked about. There's there is something in here for workers. There's something in here for small business owners. But what about just the surrounding community? Let's say that you are not a user of cannabis.\nSpeaker 2: You are not interested in work. In a cannabis business. You are not interested in owning a cannabis business, but this new businesses in your district. How do you make sure in your area how to make sure that we track and evaluate the rent, the community reinvestment that's happening with these businesses?\nSpeaker 2: Many of these businesses that are already opened are already doing a good job at reinvesting into our communities where they're located. But I think that we should we think we can track it and then continue to encourage it.\nSpeaker 2: And that's why I'm proposing that there's a report that is submitted, and I think we should call this our community. There's a report that each cannabis businesses support is submitting as a part of this ordinance, and I think we should call that a community reinvestment report.\nSpeaker 2: And it really outlines and demonstrates your commitment to reinvestment the activities that you do. It keeps a lens of equity. It's important to local communities. And I think that's something important that the community knows that there is a plan for community reinvestment.\nSpeaker 2: That's something that came out of community. So I know there was a lot of conversation about the use of cannabis taxes. I just want to be clear. There is this isn't the conversation to talk about cannabis taxes or equity fees or any of that.\nSpeaker 2: That's all budget conversations as master fee and charges, schedule conversations. That's really not a part of this conversation. So I'm going to go ahead and start with a main motion, and this is the staff motion with those small sort of clarifications.\nSpeaker 2: So I move that we receive the supporting documentation to the record, conclude the public hearing, adopt, accept the negative declaration, and that we declare the ordinance amending the lobbyist municipal code by adding Chapter 5.9 to and amending Title 21 of the city's zoning regulations related to the regulation of adult use cannabis activity together with a local coastal\nSpeaker 2: program amendment read for the first time in LED and laid over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading with the following changes to the text of Chapter 5.9 to as presented staff's recommended action.\nSpeaker 2: So number one, that Section 5.92.154.8.1 be amended to change the social equity local hire goal from a minimum of 25% to a minimum of 40%, to be consistent with the city's project labor agreement goals. And that the second that the first sentence of section 5.92.1540. B be amended.\nSpeaker 2: Minutes Read. Adult Use Cannabis Businesses shall submit a community investment, community reinvestment and small business incubation plan to the city, describing how they intend to support equity businesses, adjacent neighborhoods and communities within eligible social equity program census tracts.\nSpeaker 2: I also move that we further adopt the resolution directing the Director of Development Services to submit a request to the California Coastal Commission to certify an amendment to the city's certified local coastal program. So that is my motion, to be clear.\nSpeaker 2: That motion allows us to move forward with a first reading today, and city attorney has a copy of this motion and essentially is the same ordinance that's presented with an amendment to a local hire and clarification of language.\nSpeaker 2: I encourage City Council to stay the course. I'm open. You know, I would love to continue the conversation. I know there's a there's a diversity of opinions and let's see where we land. But I hope that we can try to incorporate the interests and the needs of what people want and that we maintain the structure, integrity of\nSpeaker 2: the witnesses, present it today, and that we move forward today. Those are the things that I think should be a guideline or guardrails for the conversation today. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Ranga.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mary. And I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for being so thoroughly in his motion, because I totally support staff's recommendation and I totally accept the amendments, not amendments, but the enhancements that you've recommended as well.\nSpeaker 10: And it's in line with what what the people have voted for. I mean, we've been through this now for at least the four years that I've been here. And I know that this started back in 2008, 2006, around there when a different council was addressing this issue when it first came to light.\nSpeaker 10: So, I mean, we've been at this now going on ten years and we're almost at the end of the trail tonight. And I think that that's one of the opportunities that we have that that we can basically put it to play tonight so that the already the businesses that already have been licensed can continue to keep their\nSpeaker 10: doors open, continue business. It's true that this document is a living document. We can always come back and tweak it if we need to in regards to any necessary changes that we may need to make to comply with with current law.\nSpeaker 10: But we can't do that unless we get something in action on the table tonight. I'm totally supportive of Vice Mayor Richardson's motion, and I hope that my colleagues I know we're going to have a robust discussion coming up, but I hope that in the end that my colleagues will be supportive of passing the solution.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I have some questions about local hire for Mr. Schultz. So there were in the presentation I received from the staff last week, there were criteria by which a local hire counted. And there was some discussion in the community that they felt that some of those requirements were because of our funding, which I know could not\nSpeaker 4: possibly be true, because you can't use real funding when you're discussing an item that's illegal at the federal level. So my question for you is, if the ordinance stated well, I guess we can talk about what it states today, you could hire up to 40% either low income or from a CDBG.\nSpeaker 4: Would you be comfortable supporting and lifting through that program? Because in the presentation I received, it was you had to be low income and from either a CDBG or a low level offender, which I think is with a 40% goal, a significantly more difficult measure to meet and a significantly more difficult monitor.\nSpeaker 4: And from what I understand, you are the monitor and your staff, even though funded through general fund, would have to be the one verifying all these components if A, then B and all these others. And I just don't see as an employer having to actually own the business before being able to use that kind of consideration in\nSpeaker 4: hiring.\nSpeaker 2: Councilwoman Mongo before Mr. Schulz answers that, we'd like to take an opportunity to have Mr. Kelaher, Mr. Cleary, clarify the criteria that we're proposing relating to the question that you're asking. Wonderful.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Sure. So we view and recommended the policy because it does have a local hire component to it. The 25% or potentially 40% equity hire requirement is open to individuals who have lived previously in low or moderate income areas of the city.\nSpeaker 7: They don't currently have to live there. So it is open up to two other residents of Long Beach Community. And the second pathway that we created for applicants is for low income individuals with a prior cannabis arrest or low level cannabis conviction.\nSpeaker 7: And those residents could have lived anywhere in the city as well. So there is open opportunity in the city. But we also chose to target low and moderate income areas of the city, specifically for the higher requirement because of the nexus that it has to two prior cannabis arrests and the focus on low income areas in the\nSpeaker 7: city generally. So that's why we we chose to target low and moderate income census tracts through the program.\nSpeaker 4: So my desire would be low and moderate income census tracts or currently low income. Is that something you might be amenable to, vice mayor?\nSpeaker 2: My understanding is that we already have some flexibility. Let's have city staff try to clarify. I think there is a trigger if you're not of those first strikes and you meet other criteria. So let's just get a better understanding.\nSpeaker 2: So. AJ, would you mind clarifying that a little bit?\nSpeaker 7: Sure. So two responses, I guess. First, the, the, the first answer that I gave, which was that there is still a pathway for residents of the city that are not currently residents of lower mud census tracts. But also, I would want to discuss what some other cities have done to encourage local hire in addition to the equity\nSpeaker 7: hire requirement. So for example, the city of Los Angeles has a 30% equity hire requirement, but in addition, they have a 50% local hire requirement for cannabis businesses. That's not necessarily an equity component because it's not so much an equity policy as it is just a local hire policy.\nSpeaker 7: But the two can work in coordination with one another. Same thing with San Francisco. San Francisco has a 50% equity hire requirement. But as part of that, they also have a 30% local hire requirement. So it's possible to to still separate the two issues because as staff, we view them as as two separate issues.\nSpeaker 7: There's equity for low and moderate income individuals from particular geographies of the city. But then there's also local hire, which is not really part of the equity program. But if it's a priority of city council, they could include that as well.\nSpeaker 7: Separate, though, from the equity policy.\nSpeaker 4: I appreciate your answer, but it's not what I'm asking.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can I can I take a crack at it, please? Thank you. So currently, as the proposal was written, you in order to qualify, you have to be low income and. And from one of the longmont's census tracts.\nSpeaker 2: Right. Or low income. And have anywhere in the city or a previous resident of the city. And have a prior cannabis arrest record. That or incident that could have been that would have been charged as a misdemeanor prior to 2016.\nSpeaker 4: So so that is what I interpreted the briefing to have stated. But that is not what I've interpreted some of the dialog in the community and with my colleagues to be. So what I would like it to be is anyone who lives in Long Beach and is low income.\nSpeaker 4: If you lived in an area or don't live in an area, but you live at home with your parents who happen to live in an area that's no longer low income, then you're low income. We should be hiring you and we should be giving those great jobs to those individuals no matter where you live in the city\nSpeaker 4: . Another thing is we are looking to bring up the median income of the CDBG areas. So if you live in any of these areas, if you live in the first, the second, the sixth parts of the ninth and then the seventh.\nSpeaker 4: Any of those residents would, by being hired in a good job that pays a good wage with a 50 cent raise every six months, we would be able to increase the median income in those communities. And one of the things that Mayor Garcia raves about is how in some of the lowest income areas of our city, we've\nSpeaker 4: seen a $20,000 annual median income increase, and that's because we're putting people to work. And so I would like to state if Mr. Richardson's open to the friendly, you can be living anywhere in the city of Long Beach as a low income person, or you can live in a low income area as designated by the map that\nSpeaker 4: I've seen. That was during the briefing. And both of those would count towards the requirement to hit 40%.\nSpeaker 2: So a couple of things. One, I talked about the guardrail we want to keep today is making sure we don't you know, we maintain the integrity of the ordinance, so we keep the first reading. So my first question for city attorney.\nSpeaker 2: A change like that, is that a simple change or is that something requires going back to the first reading?\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor Richardson I think it depends. I'm trying to think of an easy way to do this, that we could do it simply by injury, linear. And I don't I could offer a suggestion. I'm not sure if it meets Councilwoman Mango's goal, but what we're talking about, if you have your ordinance in front of you, is on\nSpeaker 3: page 121 of the ordinance, and it is section 5.9, 2.152083. And that Section A3 A says the individual satisfies at least one of the following criteria. Small AA has lived in a Long Beach census tract for a minimum of three years, where at least 51% of the current residents have a household income at or below 80% of\nSpeaker 3: the Los Angeles County median income. We could make an easy change that I think we could accomplish tonight by striking the three year requirement. That would mean that we would take out the three year residency requirement and would read a person would qualify if they lived in along long census tract for a minimum excuse me, living along\nSpeaker 3: the census tract where at least 51% of the current residents have a household income at or below 80% of the Los Angeles County area median income. So that would be no matter where in the city and there would be no requirement.\nSpeaker 3: So someone could qualify tomorrow. That is something that we could do easily by intermediation, if that if that meets your goal.\nSpeaker 4: So what if someone is a low income resident but doesn't live in a census tract? And let me let me take a step back and address, Mr. Vice Mayor. RICHARDSON Yeah. One of the other things I'm asking for would actually make the first start date of operation September 1st.\nSpeaker 4: The difference between a first.\nSpeaker 2: Reading out of respect. If you can finish that, if you can finish the thought on the first, once we get clarity, city attorney wants to be very clear about every change and I certainly want to hear you, but I really want to close the loop so we get it.\nSpeaker 4: But I just wanted to. I just want to. Every idea is good and important, and I recognize there's a really big rush. My goal would be everyone has to pass it tonight. I've heard that at least 40 times in a week, at least from 40 different people, sometimes from the same person.\nSpeaker 4: And I do appreciate those of you who have met with me on this matter, because I know that we've had very good discussions. But my goal would be that we have adult use available in the city September 1st.\nSpeaker 4: The difference to me of August 10th and September 1st to get it right and to make sure that you guys aren't getting restrictions that are going to be so hamstrung that you actually are going to not want to or not be able to meet them.\nSpeaker 4: That would be worse off. And this from a person who feels so passionately about it and have met with the community so many times. And I have residents here who know I've had over 20 community meetings, many of which the dispensaries in my district have attended.\nSpeaker 4: My district knows I am willing to vote yes to get this passed for you to have adult use by September 1st. If the requirements are in place that protect the neighborhoods and make it possible that Long Beach residents get all these jobs.\nSpeaker 4: And so I'm trying to make it easier to hire Long Beach residents no matter where they live, if they're currently low income or can demonstrate they've been low income. Because I have Section eight renters in 90808 today, people who are on Section eight in 90808 today that need jobs.\nSpeaker 4: And so would I like you to hire someone from downtown to drive across the city to one of the six dispensaries in my district? No. Hire one of the nine a way to eight people. Who's on the section eight role?\nSpeaker 4: Alison has a list she can work with. Nick will give everyone a list of potentials. But under the current way that it's written, it's so restrictive. I can't just hand you guys a list of here's 70 residents that are all eligible that help you meet your 40%.\nSpeaker 4: So I appreciate that. And if we can just change the end to an order, I think that would hopefully be agreeable. I see you guys have finished conversing. Do you have an answer now?\nSpeaker 1: I'm Mr. Mais cricket. I'm wrong. But I think that the initial request that Councilman Mangal made, which was on the local hire piece, that is possible. And we'll still keep this a first reading, is that correct?\nSpeaker 3: If if we make if we remove the three three year requirement. But I don't think that meets what she is asking for. And I think what Councilwoman Mango is asking for, unless you could give me, you know, line and verse of what it is exactly we want to amend.\nSpeaker 3: We couldn't do that on the floor tonight. We could bring it back after we have a chance to rewrite it.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman Mango, if I can just interject here. So, number one, two things. So I don't disagree that if someone in Long Beach gets a job at a dispensary, that it's it's it's something that we should discourage. I don't disagree.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. However, two things. The guardrail we're talking about is sort of maintaining the integrity of the ordinance. There's the whole intention of calling out specific zip codes was to say 100%, you're going to hire 100% of people. You still have 60% of your workforce are still going to hire.\nSpeaker 2: That could all be from Long Beach. It says that you want to try to target either people who live in zip codes, who are, you know, zip codes, who traditionally face certain issues. The census, like these maps, were not created by city staff.\nSpeaker 2: They're consistent with federal CDBG maps. That's that's that's the intention there. I think we maintain the integrity there and there's and the order that you're looking for. So if someone has a record, they no matter where they live there, there it is included.\nSpeaker 2: The other parties we talked about. We're going to continually have to change this if we find that 40% or 25% is not feasible or that we have people that people you know, we have people that are looking to be like, I doubt someone's going to say, I'm not hiring you because you don't live in this census tract\nSpeaker 2: . It's not realistic that it's going to take at least six months for Pacific Gateway to work through this whole process. If city staff comes back in Pacific, we come back and says, there's a real problem. We're not high enough for fifth District residents.\nSpeaker 2: Then we'll make it. You know, we can make that change.\nSpeaker 4: I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 2: Let me just finish my thought. Let me just finish it. So what I would say is, if that's not something we can do tonight, I respectfully would ask, is that something that earns your support or is this something that you're at?\nSpeaker 2: Is it something that earned your support tonight?\nSpeaker 4: I think it depends. I have a few other items and I think that's the.\nSpeaker 2: Answer without a full understanding of the full picture what you're asking.\nSpeaker 4: And I'd also.\nSpeaker 2: Say I just have a list that I'm keeping. That's what I'll just do for now.\nSpeaker 4: And I would also say that the local hire passed by this council years ago, which has an annual report, has never met its goals and doesn't come back. And so it's easy to say that, but we're fighting 70 to 100 items a week right now, items where they're important and great and they take hours of our time\nSpeaker 4: and we it doesn't come back. So maybe. Let me ask Mr. Mayes another option. Mr. Mayes, if we pass the ordinance tonight, as it is, could we go to second reading on July 10th and bring an amendment on July 10th that would then be amended?\nSpeaker 4: Just the amendment things tonight to that ordinance on July ten, before a first reading of an ordinance amendment.\nSpeaker 3: Again, if it was the type of amendment that was small in nature, for instance, if you are changing an hour of operation from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., we could do it because that's an easy thing to do.\nSpeaker 3: But if we're making major changes to the structure of the ordinance and the public hasn't been notified of that, I would say we couldn't do it, but we would treat it as a first reading on July 10th and bring it back at the next council meeting the following week for a sec for first second reading.\nSpeaker 4: So maybe what we should be doing is working on an amendment that comes back on a different date so that all of those amendments could still be folded in before the August 10th versus September 1st open date. Because I feel like I'm going to get pushback on any item that I've discussed with anyone who has an opinion\nSpeaker 4: on this. If you are legally allowed to speak with so far because it has to make it the mark of it has to be the first reading tonight, which I just don't feel is reasonable. And it doesn't give an opportunity for a true dialog at the Council, which is what I expect of my colleagues.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm going to reserve the rest of my amendments here. What my colleagues have to say. I'm a Q up at the end.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I did want to Mr. Mayes raised a good point that I don't think we covered in the motion that Vice Mayor Richardson made, and that's hours of operation. Is your proposal to change the current hours of operation?\nSpeaker 5: And if so, what's that proposal?\nSpeaker 2: Well, I so that was a piece that was presented here. And I'm happy to I'm happy to read it and get your feedback since you're cued up. So this specific bullet is and I'll read it, it is that section 5.92.915 be amended to permit dispensaries that operate to operate until 10 p.m. instead of 8 p.m., and that\nSpeaker 2: all deliveries must be completed before 10 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. up to seven days per week. Now my understanding from a city attorney an adjustment from 8:00 to 10:00 is not something that would trigger another first reading.\nSpeaker 2: So it's totally on the table for us to discuss.\nSpeaker 5: Okay, so that's one of the things I want to talk about. So I just have a few comments and I appreciate you clarifying that. So as everyone here knows, I've been one of the leading voices for proceeding with caution on this issue.\nSpeaker 5: Sometimes that's not been met with enthusiasm by voices in this council chamber and some that some times that opinion has not been met with respect from all sides. So I appreciate the course of the discussion that we're having tonight and the fact that the vice mayor has recognized that we represent a very diverse city with different interests\nSpeaker 5: , and that the mayor encourages everyone to be able to talk freely and honestly without intimidation and, you know, the unnecessary commentary, because it allows us to to all represent our constituents well. But I think prudence remains a great place to operate from when we're dealing with a new industry that's in the process of getting established with regulations\nSpeaker 5: . This industry remains ever evolving. And it's clear to me that despite the efforts that we've made to have regulations, we're going to have to make some tweaks along the way. And I'm grateful that we have a council and an industry who's open to that.\nSpeaker 5: It's also clear to me that the voters have voted and the will of the people has to be considered in combination with a desire to be prudent. I respect the voters and as their representative, we'll do what I can to balance their will with the possible impacts to effectuate a policy that will protect the quality of life\nSpeaker 5: concerns for my residents. I will be I have to say that I've. Been very pleased that we have not had a huge impact of illegal storefronts, although we have a great deal of illegal delivery operations in the city, which concerns me greatly that those businesses are not following the rules when it comes to health and safety.\nSpeaker 5: And the and most importantly, for me, as you all know, education measures, education measures for our youth education and for impaired driving, which has, in fact, gone up in Orange County. There's a 46% increase in drug impaired driving submissions to the Orange County crime lab since Proposition 64 was passed.\nSpeaker 5: It's absolutely something we need to be educating our communities about. And so I've always been concerned about the illegal dispensaries because they have no duty or responsibility to educate, they have no duty to invest in the community. And frankly, they have no duty to make sure the product that people are getting is safe.\nSpeaker 5: And to me, that is a huge, huge issue. So moving forward, I want to have discussions about some, you know, cracking down on the illegal delivery operations. Having said that, having said that, I'm incredibly pleased with the stores that have opened or intending to open in my district.\nSpeaker 5: The operators have been good communicators, responsive and very accommodating to our requests for quality of life impacts. Eliot Lewis is here. He's one. He's the first operator to operate in the third district.\nSpeaker 4: The first.\nSpeaker 5: Day the business opened. This is a this is exactly what I would wish for for any business operator in my city. And the fact that it was a marijuana business operator set a gold standard for everybody that's going to operate in the third district.\nSpeaker 5: Unfortunately, the standard is so high, and I'll tell you why. The night or two before the store opened, I reached out to Eliot. I said, Eliot, please, I don't want lines, hire extra bud, tenders or whatever it is you call them, but I don't want lines out the door.\nSpeaker 5: He he said, don't worry, we got it covered. He put the two security guards out there. They looked intimidating. They did not look like they belonged in Belmont Shore. I told them, I said, Can you put these guys in a polo shirt, give them some khakis?\nSpeaker 5: I want them to be more like a greeter, like the guy outside of McCarthy's than I want somebody to be like a security guard. And within a couple of hours, he had one guard inside, one guard outside. And the guy outside is so nice and so very diligent with the regulations.\nSpeaker 5: I don't think he would let me in there if I said, I'm the councilwoman. Can I come inside and see? He would say no, and I'm grateful for that. So I can honestly say that I've had we had another issue with a resident who walked by and said she smelled marijuana.\nSpeaker 5: We contacted Eliot, he checked his filters, fixed the problem issue, resolved immediately within 24 hours. I can honestly say I've had zero issues with the one dispensary that's operating in my district and nothing but very positive interactions with the future.\nSpeaker 5: Greg and the other dispensary operators who are coming into my district. So I'm very, very grateful for the partnership. They have given me a lot of peace of mind in regards to what we are to expect when recreational comes online.\nSpeaker 5: I have no reason to believe that they would operate any differently with recreational than they've been doing with medicinal, and that to me has meant a lot and above and beyond all of that. They have been really great partners with me in addressing my real concern, which has been the illegal dispensaries.\nSpeaker 5: They supported our efforts to crack down on shutting off utilities and fines in the thousands of dollars for illegal operators. That was really huge to me and I know it wasn't an easy thing for them to support because they may have colleagues operating illegally in the industry.\nSpeaker 5: I do have concerns about some of the the impacts to the specific communities that my dispensaries are in. As those dispensary operators know, a lot of the dispensaries are located in very, very close proximity to residences. And so for me, you know, I.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 5: It's not about when people are going to buy the product, it's about the neighborhood impacts of operating the shop. At the time that we're operating the shop on Second Street, for example, we close most retailers close at 9 p.m..\nSpeaker 5: So I'd like to make a friendly amendment that we extend the hours or reduce them from the proposed 10 to 9, and then we can come back once these stores have been operating for six months and see what the impacts have been and consider extending it at that time.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember I think that's very fair. It's within in city Attorney That's within what keeps it a first reading and allows us to make this a productive meeting, correct?\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Vice Mayor. Mayor Richardson, I just want to point out that what Vice Mayor Richardson just read into the record was not actually part of his motion.\nSpeaker 2: So you're part of my motion.\nSpeaker 3: It is part of your motion. Yes.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm accepting the friendly amendment from Councilwoman Price. And thank you for. Actually helping us to understand that context. I think it's fair what's proposed initially a staffer recommendation was eight. I proposed ten. You're asking nine? I think that's very meaningful.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. It's accepted.\nSpeaker 3: So so just to be clear, we're going to have 9 p.m.. 9 p.m., yes. And what about delivery?\nSpeaker 2: Delivery till ten until 10:00?\nSpeaker 3: I love it. Ten storefronts. Nine.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes. When you do that. Yeah. The intent there is you'd rather someone be in their home until 10:00 rather than out, out until 10:00 to pursue it if they don't need to. Right. We want that flexibility at 10:00.\nSpeaker 2: So, yes.\nSpeaker 3: So that that would be an amendment to section 5.9, 2.915, and we'll make that change.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor, as far as the social equity piece of it, I agree that equity is important. I understand that I support doing everything we can to give all of the residents jobs in every industry that we can in the city.\nSpeaker 5: You know, I, I think we should be doing more to try to get people who have criminal records, job training and employment. I don't actually just talk the talk. I walk the walk every day at work when I approve offers for on cases and dispositions on cases of, you know, I did it today.\nSpeaker 5: I came off of a strike charge on a woman who was going to be deported because the strike charge would have affected her negatively. I understand the need to give people second chances. I wish we would be having these conversations.\nSpeaker 4: Just globally.\nSpeaker 5: Citywide about job opportunities and job placement, not just in the marijuana industry. But I understand it's relevant to the topic tonight. I like the idea of the Community Reinvestment Report and in requiring the businesses to outline the activities that they do.\nSpeaker 5: I also want to highlight that we do have a very diverse city. So while equity may be an important issue in some part of the city, youth education may be an important issue. In another part of the city, drivers impaired driver education may be an issue, public safety may be an issue.\nSpeaker 5: And I would hope that the partners that are working with us in our issues are talking, are in our districts, are talking about the impacts to that to the particular area that they're operating in and helping mitigate those concerns.\nSpeaker 5: And I look forward to working with the dispensary owners and my district to identify some of those community impacts and work together to mitigate them. So I will be supporting this item tonight, and I thank my colleagues for being involved in a very collaborative and respectful discussion, and I thank the audience for I think we've come a\nSpeaker 5: long way in terms of maturity and wisdom and so all of us. So I thank you guys for being partners. Thanks.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much, Councilwoman Price. And just to clarify, also kind of where we're at, so we have a motion on the floor to approve the staff recommendation. There are two tweaks to that. The first is to take the 25% to a 40% goal, and the second is to move the hour of operations from 10 to 9\nSpeaker 1: . That is a motion on the floor.\nSpeaker 3: There was mayor, there's third there is a third one. And that has to do with slightly changing the language to read that the first sentence of section 5.9, 2.1.\nSpeaker 1: I mean that's a that's technical, right?\nSpeaker 3: Well, it's what.\nSpeaker 1: Tell me if there's substantive change to that.\nSpeaker 3: Yet. It has to it has to do with describing the type of it report that is that that's fine.\nSpeaker 1: That's fine. That's pretty technical. Okay. Then the larger changes are around those two. So that is a motion on the floor as accepted so far by Vice Mayor Richardson had. Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 8: Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. I'm here. You know, I really cannot listen to what I've just heard. And I think that that's very commendable and both of you guys part. But I want to thank the staff, you know, for prepared this report and everyone has formed an opinion and brought it up, you know, to our\nSpeaker 8: council tonight. I think we need to pass something today because, you know, there are dozens of dispensaries that have followed the law in there and have been patient, you know, with us. And they have lost business because of the illegal dispensaries.\nSpeaker 8: You know, I feel strongly to reward the businesses that have followed, you know, the law thus far. And with that, you know, I think that if we discover that there are things that we need to fix, I think we can discover them down the line because to do trial and error, we must start somewhere.\nSpeaker 8: And this is why I really want to thank our councilman Rex and Mrs. Susan Price for at least getting us started in the right direction. And I think by doing that with my total recommendation, I definitely would like to get this started because I've never seen the dispensaries.\nSpeaker 8: You know, that we had come to the table and be so, you know, compassionate, honest. They've never had any. We've never had any picket outside. They came here with intent to say, look, I'm going to follow everything that the city has asked them.\nSpeaker 8: Now they've done that. Now it's time for us to reward them and do what the right thing. And I think that to do the things that we have in our both of our attention, I think that's the right thing to do.\nSpeaker 8: I want to thank Councilman Price and Susie for doing this. I mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: You.\nSpeaker 8: Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, too. Thank you very much, Councilmember Supernova.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. And just to follow up on the mayor's synopsis, I'm not sure if you mentioned delivery til 10 p.m., but storefront still not delivered. Okay. Yes. I just had a question for staff and I'm moving forward on this.\nSpeaker 2: I just want to give them a chance to respond to the changes that are made. So, for instance, the 25% versus 40%, I assume there was some thought that went into the 25%. So here's your opportunity. If you'd like to tell us what might be problematic in going to 40% or it's no.\nSpeaker 2: Are there any issues, impediments to go this way?\nSpeaker 7: We don't view any impediments. Other cities have gone higher. Los Angeles is at 30% equity higher. San Francisco is at 50% equity higher. We're splitting the difference. We have a good faith requirement as part of it. So we have the flexibility to work with businesses to achieve that goal.\nSpeaker 7: And we have a built in window of a year for businesses to hit that that target. So we think it's something we could work with.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And just where where do the 25% come from? Was that best practices elsewhere or how did you arrive at that number?\nSpeaker 7: We looked at we did a projection of the number of jobs that the industry could create. We compare that to the economic demographic data for the targeted areas. We also found a telling statistic with the Census Bureau that found that 25% of jobs in Long Beach are held by Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 7: So we felt that since we were targeting a subset of the Long Beach population, that that was a realistic goal to aim for. But it's an art. It's not a science. And I think that 40% is reasonable.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you. The other question I have would be on those delivery hours till 10 p.m.. What recourse would we have? Should neighbors complain about noise? We've had we've had issues with grocery delivery at that hour. So maybe the city attorney can weigh in and that what are our options moving forward?\nSpeaker 3: So if we do allow 10 p.m. deliveries and it proves to be a problem. The recourse really would be to bring the matter back and change the delivery hour to an earlier hour that might be more compatible with the neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. I want to first say how much I appreciate staff's work on this. I know putting together an equity policy for a new industry in 180 days wasn't easy. So I want to applaud you guys for your efforts.\nSpeaker 4: I'm really glad I waited too, to speak. It was really great to hear my colleagues speak tonight, and I'm fully in support of the motion on the floor. I think that it shows leadership on this council's part. It shows growth and how far we've come to be able to tackle some of the difficult issues.\nSpeaker 4: I do have a couple of things that I wanted to just mention. There's no changes I want to make on the floor, but there are some substantive issues I just want to bring up quickly. One in the local hire piece and the social equity 40% number.\nSpeaker 4: I do agree with Councilmember Mongo on the challenges with getting to that number. And so I want to encourage staff. I've already brought it up with our assistant city manager and AJ. Some of my concerns on this issue.\nSpeaker 4: And so I hope that in 6 to 9 months we can get a report on how we're doing. My hope and I know the city prosecutor's not here tonight, but out of everybody that can ID who has a low level offense in the city of Long Beach, a low level marijuana offense.\nSpeaker 4: Possibly we could get them to do some outreach first and direct them to the program. I know that we can't share that information across departments, but hopefully we can think creatively about how we ensure that that pipeline is strong so that we do meet those goals and that idea around working with our housing authority as well with\nSpeaker 4: Section eight. Anything we can do to help support making sure we have that creative opportunity. I know that we're also working on, you know, an apprenticeship program and that we have to really understand as a city we're bringing on an entire industry that has been underground, but that if we've got a J if you could answer for\nSpeaker 4: me the question because I don't have the presentation in front of me, how many doors are open, whether it's grow manufacturing or retail, and how many are in the queue right now?\nSpeaker 8: This could have went real bad, real south.\nSpeaker 7: Other people answered it for me. 12 businesses licensed and 259 are currently in the process to obtain a license.\nSpeaker 4: And that to me is probably. I think that you guys have done a great job in creating this policy and creating a vision for where we want to be as a city. But that's really hard. That's I don't want to use the word embarrassing, but we have said for the last year and a half how important it\nSpeaker 4: is to follow through on the will of the voters. And I know I had a long conversation with with Lynda Tatum around what are we doing? And I'm not going to insert that into this policy. But my hope is that as we move forward with the budget, we're looking at what are we doing and development services to\nSpeaker 4: make sure that not only is it a priority, but if we are generating taxes, we need to understand, we need to put money upfront to be able to open up those doors and that waiting for those tax money to come in is not going to happen unless the doors are open.\nSpeaker 4: And so we really need, if we're going to move forward with this, to do anything we can to ensure those doors are open. Because these are small businesses that have been waiting for nine years. They have been waiting and they've been investing their life savings sometimes to do this and every month does go by.\nSpeaker 4: It is something that taxes them. And so I wanted to go on record, but the two things that are important to me moving forward is voting on the measure, on the motion, on the floor, making sure that there's a strong pipeline and that we're working with all departments that possibly can help us meet that goal, that we're\nSpeaker 4: not just putting the goal out there. And that, too, we are doing whatever we can in our Development Services Department to make sure that we're identifying staff, whether it's an ombudsman kind of proposal or having somebody that is making sure that we don't have six months after somebody puts in a proposal until they get something back and\nSpeaker 4: then they have to go back to the drawing board. So that that was what I wanted to say. And I really appreciate, again, this council's leadership and everybody's efforts and all the businesses for believing that Long Beach was the right place to open your business and sticking it out with us.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Great. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 4: So two of the other issues that I had are I feel like there are nine dispensaries that have put their neck out there, five of which have been open since March and have paid for employees, gone through the process is really spent the time to help the city know and understand the ordinance.\nSpeaker 4: And I believe that the dispensaries that have not opened yet have been waiting in the wings for all of you to do their work for them should have that same kind of grieving period when when you talk about the story that Councilman Price has had, where issues come up and a dispensary responds, well, they should be rewarded\nSpeaker 4: . And we also need a similar time period where if a dispensary violates that, they would give up their ability to get an adult use permit. And so something that I had discussed extensively and I really had felt was important to our community was that a dispensary should have to be open as a medical dispensary before being able\nSpeaker 4: to open as an adult use. So. What that would mean is if we made it a six month limit that you had to be open for six months before being able to open as an adult, use that September one, which this ordinance would be effective August 10th.\nSpeaker 4: At this point, if there's a substantial change, that new substantial change should I have to introduce it at a future meeting would be effective August 17th instead of the 10th. I know that sounds life changing to some people, but I really feel strongly that for those of you who've made the investment, who've hired the staff, I've talked\nSpeaker 4: to some of you, some of you have 80% Long Beach employees. That's phenomenal. For those of you who have suffered through the 30 to 40 to 50 patients a day because you are only medical, I can only hope that you would want to be supportive, that each different business that is your competitor and your partner would go\nSpeaker 4: through that same kind of six month process where they would be evaluated by their community. There are lots of impacts of dispensaries. There are significantly less impacts of a medical dispensary. The number of customers of day of a medical dispensary is far less than a coffee shop.\nSpeaker 4: But the number of customers per day to an adult use facility is significantly more than a coffee shop. And so what you're talking about on these impacts to the community and the ability for a community to adjust is very, very important.\nSpeaker 4: And so I would like to know what options Mr. Richardson would be open to in allowing those of our partners who are sitting here today, the green room connected Stone Age one, love the station. All of you have been open for six months and you have a track record of no violations.\nSpeaker 4: And so my hope would be that the five of you could open September 1st and then on a rolling basis after the dispensary has been open for six months, that others would be able to join that lead. And so I think that it's really important for that demonstrated success and proving to the community that you're a good\nSpeaker 4: partner. We've also had and many of you may or may not know we've had violators of our medicals, some of which you have locked the doors on our enforcement. And so we need that six months to be able to either walk through a process where there's a corrective action and you make those changes or you get violated\nSpeaker 4: , you lose your license and it goes up to auction to one of the others of you that have already been good partners. And I would love to see a program where current Long Beach businesses who don't have violations get first stab at any license that's violated by somewhere.\nSpeaker 2: The question was, would you mind narrowing the question a bit?\nSpeaker 4: The question is, would you be open to a friendly that requires a dispensary to be open as a medical use for six months before being able to operate as a adult use?\nSpeaker 2: I'm not open to that at this point. I owe you more of an explanation. I'm happy to explain. My thought is if there's all. It's already taken a long time to get just throws open and once recreational happens.\nSpeaker 2: What I don't want to see is lines of people lined up outside of dispensaries because they have a six month delay. I mean, there's going to be I mean, we need to be prepared. What we have in front of us is already complex enough.\nSpeaker 2: There's two tiers right now. People who are in the pipeline, people who are not. That would create a third tier of people, open people in the pipeline, people who are not in the pipeline. It will really confuse this process.\nSpeaker 2: I do understand the merit of where you're going, and I don't want to dismiss that. My response was a little short, but that is why I believe that if we do see a problem as we move forward, the council owns this ordinance, we can move forward and make changes.\nSpeaker 2: But that is a that changes the structure a little too much, in my opinion. That's my justification.\nSpeaker 4: If it was able to be included as a first reading tonight, would you be okay with that?\nSpeaker 2: I don't believe that it can. But if it could, I look to the city city I look to the city attorney on whether that's even. Mr.. Mr.. MAYS. Is that a minor change or a significant change to the structure of the ordinance?\nSpeaker 3: It would be a significant change to. It's not something that I would feel comfortable doing with. I question on the floor. It's certainly a policy change that we can make. But we couldn't make it this evening.\nSpeaker 2: Could I think maybe we can work? There's nothing that stops us from coming back, working together on changes. Once we evaluate what this process looks like, and I'm sure that there will be changes to this ordinance. So I want you to just know this is this is going to be an ongoing process.\nSpeaker 2: And we and it seems like from the majority of the council members that have gotten there, the integrity of the ordinance that staff has presented for the most part has gotten positive responses. And that would be a dramatic change in terms of the ordinance.\nSpeaker 2: I just don't think that that's something I hope to.\nSpeaker 4: Well, my district has more dispensaries than 50% of what's open today, and my residents have had several community meetings, and this is very important to them. And so I've brought up two items that are important to the residents.\nSpeaker 4: I've had more community meetings probably than any other council member on these items, and I feel as though when I discuss this with city staff that we should have been put in a position where an item was come into the agenda, where we could have had more flexibility.\nSpeaker 4: And so I really want to be supportive of this item tonight, and I will again thank those of the dispensaries who have spoken to me. If you're a dispensary that's in my district and you're giving me opinions tonight, shame on you that you didn't call your councilmember before that because I have six in my district.\nSpeaker 4: Six and not all of you. Actually, less than half of you have reached out. And quite honestly, most of the reach out have been from the dispensaries in the other districts. I really appreciate many of you that are open and have made those efforts and I feel that those of the dispensaries that are in my district that\nSpeaker 4: have come to community meetings, I feel that you've heard the voices of the neighbors who feel very strongly about a performance period. And so we will work and see what we can do to find a way to make that happen.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And lastly, we have Councilman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, this was a really great discussion. I'm also glad that I sort of waited in the wings and listened to what happened today. It has been a long, long road for so many of all of us, on many very various sides.\nSpeaker 5: And I'm just glad that we're here today talking about this. And I do believe, you know, we certainly have to move this forward as well. I, I understand, you know, and in my district, overwhelmingly supportive of recreational marijuana.\nSpeaker 5: But on top of that, we do have some things that absolutely we have to think about. And I know that these are included in the ordinance. And I really appreciate the very thorough ordinance that includes all of the details.\nSpeaker 5: It seems like no detail was left out, which I truly appreciate, that it was very mindful and it was with the approach that, you know, working with business, working with the UFC, working with all of the players. Of course, I'll just reiterate, I know it's been discussed many times over various years on the city council, even city\nSpeaker 5: councils prior. But of course, major education on the do's and don'ts of where you can and cannot smoke. I have a lot of residents who constantly complain and all of this is aside from the ordinance, but just constantly complain about smoke in their home.\nSpeaker 5: And I know that that is a major quality of life issue for a lot of individuals. And so thinking about ways that we can do some pieces around that to make it more of a robust discussion and also maybe working with a property owners and apartment association to be able to include those types of messages for those\nSpeaker 5: for that issue. And then the same as Councilwoman Price, the illegal deliveries and the. Eagle storefronts. I know we're still battling that, and it absolutely compromises the competition that our legal dispensaries and legal deliveries are currently going through in that we need to just nix right away in any way, any way, shape or form.\nSpeaker 5: And I am going to keep belaboring that issue. But, you know, it's a big deal. And then lastly, I really appreciate that. Well, it's state mandated, but, you know, I know that just being able to the product packaging and advertising for youth, I think we see that a lot in the vapor side of things.\nSpeaker 5: But being able to really do something very creative here locally because we do have a lot of youth, especially now, as I mentioned, with vaping and all of that. I have a 17 year old at home and just the thought of him picking up something and thinking it's, I don't know what and it's bubblegum and it's packaged\nSpeaker 5: , you know, for kids and youth and directed towards that. So with all that said, those are like my three main things that I think I've heard a lot about just being a mom, but also just representing a lot of parents myself I wanted to make sure we brought forward.\nSpeaker 5: But again, I look forward to seeing this through. It's going to be a big benefit for us and we'll see what that looks like in terms of tax revenue and the return on investment for the city and where that will lead.\nSpeaker 5: So thanks so much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. With that members, we have a motion in front of us that by Benjamin Richardson and customary Ringo. Please cast your votes. Well, Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 4: I thought I would make one last plea to the vice mayor. Okay. Mr. Vice Mayor, do you understand that I have more. You and I have the most dispensaries of all city. You and I combine four more dispensaries and 70% of the sale.\nSpeaker 4: What about an item that allows for home delivery immediately? Ready? One. But you have to be open as a store front for six months before you can sell at the storefront.\nSpeaker 2: Home delivery is already very active in our city today.\nSpeaker 4: But I'm talking about adult use home delivery by my by authorized dispensaries.\nSpeaker 2: How are you going to police that? It is a large, broad conversation.\nSpeaker 4: Look, I know our dispensaries are choosing not to do home delivery of adult use because they don't want to violate. We'd be opening that door for them.\nSpeaker 2: Has this proposal been vetted by staff? Have you talked to the city attorney? Have you talked with the industry? Has been has been because none of every proposal that's come up has been sort of developed through the process.\nSpeaker 2: Know what I don't want to do is deviate too far from the integrity of the ordinance.\nSpeaker 4: I have discussed, as with city attorney, he said it would be more substantial than originally expected. I discussed several of these things with city staff a week ago, none of which was folded in because it was bifurcated, but it was important to the community.\nSpeaker 4: I have met with members of the industry and there is just a huge community impact and it is completely disrespectful to the community that some of the dispensaries that are not open yet are waiting in the wings until the day adult use is available and then they're just going to open up and steal a lot of customers\nSpeaker 4: from. Some of you have been up in open for a long time. You should have first rate to the market and first rate to those individuals.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. But I'm not interested in that that amendment.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. We have a motion on the floor. Support this motion and I'm looking forward to moving forward. Please cast your votes.\nSpeaker 0: He. Motion carries. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. We're going to take. Next. We're going to. We have believe it or not, we still have two items that have been requested to be moved up. And so where do those next? One is on suicide prevention and the other is a report on fireworks.\nSpeaker 1: So those are gonna be the next two items. We're taking a one minute recess. I want to get to those items and then the regular agenda.\nSpeaker 2: And then the regular.\nSpeaker 1: \u20ac133 compensation.\nSpeaker 4: Everything is important. But first of all, you're going to have nine open. Oh. And the what?\nSpeaker 3: You know. They did.\nSpeaker 4: But they did not meet any other goals. I wrote about it the other day. They're like, You don't require they do anything. And if they don't, they don't do anything because it wasn't God, it was a CFS.\nSpeaker 1: Oh. I can have everyone grab a seat, please. And. If you're chatting, please exit the council chambers.\nSpeaker 3: Okay? Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, everyone.\nSpeaker 4: Everyone should.\nSpeaker 1: Madam Kirk, can you please take a role for Councilwoman Gonzalez?\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Pearce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember. Super. Now here. Councilwoman Mongo here. Councilman Andrews. Councilmember Arango. Councilman Austin. Vice Mayor Richardson. Mayor Garcia.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And again, we still have two items before we hit the regular agenda. So I want to get through those. We're going to do a suicide prevention plan and then we have a fireworks report. And from what I understand, there's also a fire.\nSpeaker 1: Report from staff that it's I think we're going to do them at the same time, but two different items. Okay. So let's go ahead and do the suicide prevention plan.\nSpeaker 0: Communication from Councilmember Pearce, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilman Price, Councilmember Super Non recommendation to request city manager to work with Department of Health and Human Services and Long Beach Police Department and report back to council in the next 30 days.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Including presentation on city council approval process, financing plan and fiscal impact analysis. And we're putting up the presentation.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening, mayor council members. My name's Jennifer Ott, chief operating officer for alameda point here for our may status report on Alameda Point. And while I'm going to touch very briefly on some pretty pictures, the real focus tonight is on the hard numbers here and starting to really look at some of the financial and fiscal pieces of\nSpeaker 9: the project and get into some of the. Nitty gritty and technical parts of that. So that's what I'm going to focus on tonight. The. This.\nSpeaker 1: You know, I mean.\nSpeaker 9: Just. Okay. I'm just going to turn this slide. Sorry. Excellent. So the presentation over here, I'm going to quickly go over the May 11th Planning Board actions. You know what took place last week. Review the upcoming June 16th City Council meeting documents and process.\nSpeaker 9: There's a lot that's going to be on that agenda. We've been kind of piecemeal in it, too, over time. But I just want to be really clear about what's what the recommendation, where we're headed that night. And then I'm going to present a summary of the city financing plan and then present an approach to fiscal neutrality and\nSpeaker 9: the summary of the aluminum point inside our fiscal impact analysis. First May 11th Planning Board action. So the on May 11th, the planning board took three actions. The first was to approve the development plan. I should say those actions were all unanimous.\nSpeaker 9: They approved the development plan. That's been all the pretty pictures that you've been seeing over the last several months. This is obviously an image of that. I have that here on the computer. So if there are questions about that and what got ultimately approved, I can pull that up as part of the questions and we can walk\nSpeaker 9: through that. I'm not going to go over that tonight. I'm going to focus on the numbers piece. Unless you have questions about it. We also they also recommended city council approval of the development agreement, not the disposition development agreement, which is really all the nuts and bolts of all the obligations related to land payment and developer obligations\nSpeaker 9: . But it is the development agreement related to kind of the city's hat that it wears as part of the regulatory agency and in kind of vesting some of the rights that they have under the development plan. So that also got recommended to the City Council for approval and then they provided some final comments on the team compliance\nSpeaker 9: strategy. June 16th City Council. What's what's coming is that disposition development agreement that I just mentioned that itself will be agreement that the majority of the pages will be a very lengthy document that will walk through all the development obligations, the terms of price, in terms of payment, the term of the agreement.\nSpeaker 9: I'm going to actually walk through a couple of provisions with you tonight, just things that you haven't heard yet. And then attached to it is all of this, along with a bunch of exhibits that are pretty immediate themselves.\nSpeaker 9: Some of them you've seen, some of them haven't. The first is the TDM compliance strategy. You've seen different iterations of that, an affordable housing implementation plan, which really is the agreement and kind of plan for implementing the the city's inclusionary housing ordinance, the density bonus ordinance, as well as the provisions of the Renewed Hope Settlement Agreement.\nSpeaker 9: All of that will be in an exhibit attached to the Disposition Development Agreement, a milestone schedule that lays out and I'm going to get into this in a second, the major milestones, progress milestones, so we can keep track of performance over time, making sure that the developer is performing and doing the things that they said they're going\nSpeaker 9: to do a phasing plan which looks at the phasing of development that was attached to the development agreement. And so that was in your packet for tonight. The infrastructure package, consistent with the master infrastructure plan, consistent with RFQ that was issued from developers.\nSpeaker 9: That $88 million package of infrastructure. It outlines the phasing of the infrastructure. That, too, was attached to the development agreement. A part of your packet for tonight leases for two of the buildings. That building 117 118. There are two lease commercial buildings that ultimately will be part of a phase three conveyance to the developer for commercial development\nSpeaker 9: . But the developer and we can talk about this in a second if there are questions about this that wants to have leases, we actually use those buildings for jobs and investment and commercial development before they take title to that land.\nSpeaker 9: So these leases allow them to use those buildings on an interim basis that a master Tidelands trust lease for building one 3113 and two restaurant pad. So part of the site falls in the state tidelands trust areas which we own, but we cannot sell and we own it and we keep it in trust on behalf of the\nSpeaker 9: state of California. And so it's highly restricted about what kind of uses occur there. We can't sell it. And so this will be a lease because there are parts of the the waterfront that they want to use for restaurants and reuse one of our buildings.\nSpeaker 9: And so this lease contemplates the use of those properties within the Tidelands trust areas and then a subdivision improvement or public improvement agreement that talks about the infrastructure construction and making sure that they're performance bonds so that ultimately the infrastructure gets once it gets started, it it gets ultimately there's a performance bond to make sure that the\nSpeaker 9: infrastructure gets built and then a license agreement for phase zero activities. The development agreement, which was attached to your staff report tonight, and then the multifamily housing waiver, which is required under the town center plan to allow the type of housing and the product types that are required under the town center is that there's a waiver of\nSpeaker 9: the multifamily housing prohibition pursuant to the density bonus ordinance. And so they've requested that those letters have been attached to a couple of different staff reports. So all of this will be this whole package of documents we're working madly and not just me, your city attorney's office, all the different departments are getting pulled in on various aspects\nSpeaker 9: of this. So we're all working very hard to put all these documents together and come to you on June 16th with a recommendation, I should say. The developer as well. We're working very closely with them on all of this.\nSpeaker 9: So now to the numbers part of this. Actually, I'm sorry, before that, I wanted to just mention this because this is a part of the DDA that we wanted to make sure that you understood going before we come to you with the DDA, the INA specify that the overall term of the DDA or this development, this disposition\nSpeaker 9: development agreement was 20 years. So if it's executed this year, that's 2035. The project milestone, the schedule that the developer has put forward is actually a 15 year development schedule. We were very appreciative that the developer did not max out the full timelines of the 20 years.\nSpeaker 9: So they've actually been very aggressive about their milestones, schedules and their performance and we appreciate that. And so what that project Milestone Schedule says is that the Phase three completion of the project, which is the the final phase, is expected to be complete in 2030.\nSpeaker 9: There are potential extensions to this, which I'm going to get to in the next slide. But that puts phase one, essentially each phase at about five years. It's a little less than five years. The potential extensions to the milestones schedule are only allowed on major milestones.\nSpeaker 9: So closing on the transfer of the land. Completion of infrastructure completes completion of vertical. And then there's these progress milestones. So for instance, design review or commencing infrastructure, we they're in a schedule. We want to keep track of those things because that's early indicators of whether or not the performance is likely to occur or not.\nSpeaker 9: But they're not events of default. So if they don't meet those project milestones, that doesn't have the same consequences. What we really care about is, are you closing on the land or are you completing the infrastructure, you're completing the vertical.\nSpeaker 9: And so those are what we have defined as major milestones, potential extensions to the milestones schedule. Overall, there's a cap, a ten year cap on extensions. So that puts us if you and that's from the milestone schedule. So 15 years, they're being very aggressive about their schedule.\nSpeaker 9: They get to ten year cap on all extensions and I'll outline what those are. So that puts kind of the outside date at 25 years of five years past the 20 year term that was contemplate in the in a only if certain thing only if they are able to to qualify for certain extensions, extension payments, they're allowed\nSpeaker 9: to take five extension extensions by paying the city for those extensions. Those extensions are much more expensive before phase one at 50% of phase one infrastructure, $50,000 an acre after phase one infrastructure that goes down to 10,000 acre.\nSpeaker 9: The thought there is really that once that phase one infrastructure, the phase one infrastructure is a very large amount of work. And so once they've made that investment, we believe their incentive is to build the project and get it done because so much money has gone into it.\nSpeaker 9: So we've kind of reduced the option payments so they have an elect they can elect to extend those major milestones, closing completion of infrastructure, completion of vertical by paying the city to extend. That's and that's limited to only five of the ten years.\nSpeaker 9: Then there are two other ways that the term well three other ways but economic force majeure which is if the economic there's an economic downturn, that there's a decrease in the home price index or a certain number of years that they can qualify for an economic force majeure extension, and that it's a very high bar.\nSpeaker 9: And so it's really comparable to what we experienced in the recent recession. We had our financial consultant, Wealden, who's here today, actually chart out that index over 20 years or something over 20 years. And the only two times we met that threshold was when there was a really severe recession.\nSpeaker 9: So we've kind of calibrated this index to recessions that have occurred in the past. So we feel comfortable that we're only going to be in that economic force majeure situation when we're really experiencing a significant downturn in the economy and then a standard force majeure, which is which is more standard, which is really things that, you know\nSpeaker 9: , major issues like a disaster or essentially water supply. There is no water supply or some major disaster, a war or some other thing where there are major issues outside of Alameda Point Partners and the Cities Control, then they would be allowed to take extensions.\nSpeaker 9: The last is a Navy delay. So that's if the city is doesn't get the land by the timeline. If we can't actually give them the land to develop it, they don't want to be punished or, you know, for us not being able to give them the land to develop the property, obviously it's very hard to develop the\nSpeaker 9: property without the land. And so we've allowed for this circumstances. So the city has in the milestones schedule certain dates by which it's expected to provide the land in order to meet all these timelines. And so there would be a delay related to that overall, except for the Navy delay, which isn't subject to the cap, all these\nSpeaker 9: other delays are subject to the ten year cap on extensions. And really the thought there is, you know, at some point, if we have ten years, for instance, a worst case scenario of some sort of standard force majeure or a war or something like that, we should probably all sit down and figure out whether or not this\nSpeaker 9: project still makes sense. I mean, this can't go on forever. And so we wanted to cap that. And again, that cap is on the 15 year schedule, not the 20 year term. So it, you know, really only puts the city's kind of outside liability in terms of extensions to the 25 years of the.\nSpeaker 0: Before you continue at 11:00, we need a motion to continue our meeting and it requires three votes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: All those in favor.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 0: Oppose. Oppose passes 4 to 1.\nSpeaker 9: So that's that's kind of I wanted to to highlight this. If you've got questions about this, it's kind of we've gone over with the NRA, had a lot of information on the terms the price in terms of payment.\nSpeaker 9: We've talked about that a lot. We haven't really talked about this. We've kind of recently come to an agreement on this. I wanted to put this out there as quickly as possible so that you're not you know, you're getting exposed before the 16th to a lot of the major issues so that there aren't, you know, any major\nSpeaker 9: surprises on June 16th. So that's why I'm raising it now. Happy to answer questions tonight or moving forward. But I wanted to highlight these issues to you, to the council and the public. So the next thing is really the site, a financing plan.\nSpeaker 9: What that and what that is is really what they've provided is required in the NRA, that they provide us a financing plan that shows how this project is going to work. The finances of they provided that to us in the form of a land development cash flow analysis.\nSpeaker 9: I am going to explain what that is. But really as the city, being the landowner and entering into a public private partnership where you're essentially selling the land to private entity to come in and develop it, it's very important for the city to understand the economics of the deal so that it understands that it's not selling the\nSpeaker 9: land for too little or that there are the understands that their what what the developers committing to in terms of infrastructure, that you're creating parameters around the economics of the deal and that the city is making sure it's protecting its financial interests.\nSpeaker 9: And so the developer provided us their project perform our cash flow analysis, which is an accounting and a comparison of sources and uses of funds. So it's just kind of really just means revenues and expenses over time. And we have that.\nSpeaker 9: We had our financial consultant review all the assumptions in that to make sure that it's been vetted independently, that we're not just taking the developer's word for it, and that's really broken out. I'm going to walk through each of these so that people understand how this works with the sources of funds or revenues include mainly land sale\nSpeaker 9: proceeds. So because it's a land development proforma, it has all the revenue is related to selling land and getting land ready for improved land ready for sale. So the land sale proceeds are essentially the way you calculate these is by looking at how much you think you're going to build or sell something or rent something for.\nSpeaker 9: So how much you're going to sell the townhomes for, for instance, how much is it going to cost you to build them? What is the difference between how much you'll sell them for versus cost? What's that difference? The difference is the land value.\nSpeaker 9: It's called a residual land value. That is what's used to determine the land sale proceeds in this model. That's very standard for this type of situation. And then you do that for every product type and it's based on market assumptions about rents.\nSpeaker 9: And we're going to I'll talk about those in a sec about sales prices, rents for retail, rents for commercial. And so you had in your packet assumptions about all of those things as well, because it's important for in order to value land, you need to understand what ultimately the land is going to be used for and the\nSpeaker 9: value of it. And so that's all built into this model, the other revenue source. To tell me that I'm going too fast. But, you know, slow down if I'm going too fast or I'm not explaining something clearly, I want to make sure everyone understands this.\nSpeaker 9: But the other revenue is a public financing mechanism. It's called community facilities district bond or district bond proceeds. You just recently approved this for Alameda Landing. This is a very standard way to you, basically leverage the value of the land to secure bonds, to pay for infrastructure, and then property owners in that area pay a special tax\nSpeaker 9: essentially in the special taxes. What's used to pay back those bonds for infrastructure? We do assume that in this case that there will be bond proceeds for infrastructure. The also developed equity, although not a true it's not really a revenue, it's a source of funds.\nSpeaker 9: But any time in the proforma that you see that there's a negative so that it revenue or, you know, expenses exceed revenue and there's a negative the developers potentially using equity to pay for those shortfalls in those years.\nSpeaker 9: So there is money that the developer, they're writing checks to cover shortfalls in years. And so that's part of their are a source of funds to to pay for the development or for the land development uses of funds, essentially expenses.\nSpeaker 9: They include pre-development costs. So all the costs of the developer spending out on the development plan, on the negotiation of the DDA, all of the design review applications, you know, the architecture expenses to put the design review applications together and go through the planning process, all those will be considered pre-development costs and they're just what they sound\nSpeaker 9: like, all the costs that kind of gets you to the point where you can actually develop something and get it entitled that you actually allow and permitted, that you're now allowed to actually build something are considered pre-development costs, land payments.\nSpeaker 9: Those are in the the staff report. Those are the $5 million for the sports complex, the $10 million ferry terminal payment, $15 million land payment phase, zero activities, site preparation. So this means demolition of buildings. It means any geotechnical remediation to make sure that you mitigate any settlement issues or seismic issues in the land, any grading that\nSpeaker 9: has to occur then the infrastructure costs. So those those are when we've talked about the $88 million, that's all those parks, the 15 acres of parks, all the roads, all of those infrastructure costs are counted here, professional services, the cost it'll take to actually design the infrastructure and then developer overhead to essentially kind of manage that effort\nSpeaker 9: is also included. So that's kind of the one on one on land development, cash flow and how it works and what was in your packet. And this is the tool that we use to really try to assess the the economics of the deal continued there's we also want to make sure, as I mentioned, that the city's getting\nSpeaker 9: a good deal. So how do we determine feasibility of the project? How do we determine whether or not we're getting a fair price for the land and we. We talk about return requirements. So we're and so what we've essentially built into the agreement is the city at some point we agree.\nSpeaker 9: Developer you're taking all this risk, a lot of risk building a lot of infrastructure. You're doing all these things. There's a lot of complexity. So you should be essentially you get the market rate of return, not a guarantee, but you should achieve a market rate of return on your investment.\nSpeaker 9: And we have to talk about what that market rate of return is. Of course, that's subject to negotiation. But ultimately, the city, at some point, once you've reached your market rate of return, the city wants to participate. This is our land.\nSpeaker 9: We've invested a lot of money in the air, the other entitlements, staff time. So we want to start participating. Once you've reached that threshold of market rate return, we want to participate. And so but it's really intended to be a windfall protection.\nSpeaker 9: The city it's in staff's approach to this. We have tried to negotiate a lot of upfront infrastructure. So the sewer line or the ramp, you know, Ralph, our Bazardo extension, try to frontload as much of that because from our standpoint, getting built improvements in early parks, for instance, all those things, Bill Early actually gives us something concrete\nSpeaker 9: that the community, not just people live in Alameda but all of Alameda can enjoy. So we don't see this as a way to make a ton of money for the city. What this is intended to do is, hey, if you are wildly successful developer, you shouldn't just run away with all these profits.\nSpeaker 9: We need to share too, because we've taken risks, we put in money, it's our land. So we need to have some kind of recognition that you're putting in this investment. You get to meet your rate of return. But ultimately, we want to participate in any in any profits above a certain above a certain threshold.\nSpeaker 9: So that's what this contemplates, is called profit participation. It's again, it's intended to be a windfall protection. Well, we have talked about this is what we're proposing as city shares and profits. Once our main point partners obtains market rates of return of two returns, an 18% internal rate of return and a 1.6 cash flow index.\nSpeaker 9: And I'll explain what those are. You want me?\nSpeaker 4: May I just ask explain what a 1.6 cash flow index is.\nSpeaker 9: Yes. So I'm going to let me start with the internal rate of return, because not everyone may know what that is either. And these are going to be kind of high level explanations. And I can if you have other detailed questions, I are consultant here to explain.\nSpeaker 9: But that idea with an internal rate of return as a way to measure profitability over time and essentially taking into consideration the time value of money. So this is kind of one of the only I shouldn't say only one of the most typical way to kind of recognize the fact that a dollar that you get next year\nSpeaker 9: is not worth the same as a dollar today that there. And so you sort of be able to measure profitability over time is essentially what the internal rate of return return does. And we have said, the developer said and we agree that, you know, given the risk of this project and a lot of the uncertainties you're going\nSpeaker 9: to, you know, will allow you to reach an 18%. That's a market rate of return of 18%, internal rate of return before we participate. But we also recognize is that they they want to achieve both an 18% internal rate of return and a 1.6 cash flow index.\nSpeaker 9: And the castle index is a way to essentially compare profitability to equity. So how much they make versus how much they've had to invest, that's a very high level. But that's basically is this kind of really recognizing the relationship between profit and equity investment on the developer's part.\nSpeaker 9: And so that's what that cash flow index measures. And so they in order for the city to start participating, the developer has to meet both of those threshold returns. Now, I want to be clear, there's no guarantee the city is not guaranteeing that they get these all the and that's part of why they get the, you know\nSpeaker 9: , these rate of returns. And they are what they are is because there's a risk, there's a chance they don't meet those at all. And that risk that something goes wrong and they've invested all this money and, you know, something does happen and they don't get those returned.\nSpeaker 9: The city isn't guaranteeing that they get those returns in any way, but once they do, then the city starts participating kind of at an increasing share of the profits. So starting at 18%, assuming they meet the 1.6 cash flow index, the city would start participating about 10% of the profits, and then that goes up over 20%.\nSpeaker 9: It's 20% profit position, 20 to 30. And then when they hit the 25% IRR, the city would start. Every dollar would be split essentially between the developer and the city. Again, this is all in the DDA. It's it's probably more than people want to know.\nSpeaker 9: But it's it's a want you to understand that we have tried to really protect the city's interest in terms of making sure the developer doesn't, you know, use the land and develop it and then run off with a bunch of profits.\nSpeaker 9: And this will all all of these detailed provisions are in the DDA.\nSpeaker 5: And I just want to say quickly that that's an important point that you just mentioned, because if you take a look at the way that it's structured, I mean, one can conceivably. I envision a scenario where. Where someone hits the air threshold at 22% and suddenly say.\nSpeaker 5: I don't want to give 30% of the profit. And so there has to be some mechanism where we can evaluate the amount of investment, equity and all that kind of stuff. So that's what we're looking. Among other things.\nSpeaker 9: And I did forget to say that we have kind of analyze, ah, so what is, is this we've kind of looked at their performance, their cash flow and determined three main things that I think are important to mention.\nSpeaker 9: One is that they do show that they're achieving a 22% IRR that is, we believe, a feasible project. So we believe that what they're proposing is feasible financially given the assumptions that are that are in there. We also think it's important to mention that, you know, we don't we don't think there's a excess land value.\nSpeaker 9: I mean, there's kind of methods that they're given. We've kind of maxed out with the infrastructure that's being proposed here in the land. But the $15 million land payments, what's it showing is that there is an excess land value that we're kind of leaving on the table.\nSpeaker 9: And then the last thing is that based on what the numbers that are in there, we would not be receiving any profit participation based on this. They're very close to meeting the 1.6, but haven't quite yet. And so we're not what they're showing is we think we have a feasible project, but we've kind of maxed it out\nSpeaker 9: in terms of infrastructure and land payments, and there really isn't any windfall at this point. That doesn't mean there won't be. These are all just assumptions, right. And so ultimately, it's going to be based on what did they actually sell things or how much did it cost to build?\nSpeaker 9: And those will get plugged into the analysis as we move forward with development. So so that we'll be keeping track of that. Every phase will be keeping track of what did you how where did your revenues come out?\nSpeaker 9: Where did your costs come out? Let's look at that. Do you owe us any money? Do not. And if after a given phase, it shows that they are meeting those two thresholds and there are excess profits, then we will actually be putting those funds into an account.\nSpeaker 9: We we don't it doesn't mean we get that money necessarily because you got to kind of wait till the end of the project to figure out if how did it all turn out. But we do want is we want those funds segregated into a separate account so so that we don't they don't think of it as their\nSpeaker 9: money. It's really our money until it's kind of proven that that it's not ours anymore. And so it's just kind of keeping it separate, making it being thought of as is different than money that they're able to use for other things.\nSpeaker 9: So that's how, how we've structured that. So I want to I know there's been a lot of questions about rents and monthly rental rates, and so I wanted to touch on this. I put this table together. I thought it would be helpful.\nSpeaker 9: But you look at it's a lot of numbers, but the intent is to really show convert different based on the area median income and it varies by household size what the rents would be for very low, low moderate.\nSpeaker 9: And then the estimated market rents I'm just going to go through these quickly is assuming someone has an income of about 32 to $38000, they'd be paying $854 a month for one bedroom if they met that kind of very low category.\nSpeaker 9: And then it goes up the bigger the household size. And so you see for a three bedroom, we are assuming a four person household size that's about $46,000 income. They'd be paying a little over 1100 dollars in rent.\nSpeaker 9: And obviously that goes up there. The project is providing about is providing 16% and these very low, low categories, 9% in the moderate and then the rest as both this is rental rates, but obviously there's townhomes as well, we believe.\nSpeaker 9: And what you see here is, I mean, when you look at the moderate incomes at 120% of the area, median income, someone making about, you know, anywhere between 78 and $90,000 would be paying about 2000 their market rent based on the rents that are in the performa that we have peer reviewed and looked at would be paying\nSpeaker 9: about 20 $600 a month, you know, in a one bedroom apartment. The townhomes obviously are more expensive. The townhomes are looking at more in the $900,000 per unit range. The condos in the second phase are looking at closer to about $700,000 range.\nSpeaker 9: So, you know, we believe this shows you that there is kind of a spectrum of housing that's being provided to a lot of different income categories.\nSpeaker 0: Before we move on. Yes. When you look at this chart, how in order to qualify, for instance, of first category below 50%. How many people are in your families for these different categories? Isn't it based on existing households?\nSpeaker 9: So I made certain assumptions that the one bedrooms would be one in two person households. This would be 2 to 3 person households. And then they are I'm sorry, this is 3 to 4 and then this is four.\nSpeaker 9: So I had to make those assumptions because the way that the area median income is calculated is based on household size. So I made the assumption that again, one bedroom is a 1 to 2 person household, two bedroom is a 3 to 4 and then three bedroom is a four person household and they don't have anything beyond\nSpeaker 0: . Four as a five.\nSpeaker 9: There's no five person household, so they only.\nSpeaker 0: Calculated two bedroom. You said 3 to 4, there's 3 to 4. And that's because it's overlapping the numbers.\nSpeaker 9: These are overlapping just because they don't they don't have a five person house. So once you hit the four person household, that is.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So when I'd like this chart to include but the household members to qualify for these numbers when we see this again. Sure. And then your prices for the condos. But what did you say they were the condos.\nSpeaker 9: They started phase two. So they're priced at about 700,000 per unit. Okay. And this is what's in the performance. I want to be clear on that. Market rents and market prices is that these are market rents and market prices.\nSpeaker 9: So if the economy goes down, this could be less as the economy continues to go the way it is, these could be more. So I want to disclose that this isn't they're not guaranteeing these rents at these prices.\nSpeaker 9: This is what's in the performa. We have reviewed those versus what we looking at the market. Our independent consultant has looked at them. We think these are reasonable, honestly high end for for what you're seeing in Alameda now.\nSpeaker 9: But we believe these are reasonable assumptions to have in the financing plan.\nSpeaker 5: And I thought I heard you say that we're building in the old Warren Buffett margin of error just in case something goes wrong and the rents go down. So that because we have fixed allocations and the rents go down or the property values go down, we still want the sports complex and all that.\nSpeaker 5: So. We factor that in?\nSpeaker 9: Well, I think what this for the sports complex and the ferry terminal payment, once we transfer the phase one land to the developer, that $50 million is nonrefundable.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: So the on the condos are those one and two bedrooms. But but what you're describing is a condo. Or how many square feet? You know.\nSpeaker 9: I don't know if it's on my head.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So that's something else I'd want to know is on condos. What we're talking about?\nSpeaker 9: Sure.\nSpeaker 0: How many square feet? One one. One two bedroom. What is what is being described as a condo? Oh, okay. And then the three bedrooms. Those are townhomes. Is that what you don't know?\nSpeaker 9: The estimated? We didn't do any for sale on this. I'm just doing because I know there were a lot of questions about rent, so I just didn't rents. I didn't include all I meant when I was talking about the townhomes and condos was to show you that those are those are obviously for people making you know, those\nSpeaker 9: are given the mortgage payments for a $900,000 townhome. All I meant was that I kind of think of this as this kind of increasing kind of spectrum of housing product that that once after these market rents for apartments, you're getting into people who can afford essentially townhome or condos so that you're providing different product, housing, product or\nSpeaker 9: a mix of incomes. From the very low to the person who can afford a 900,000 square foot are 9000 $900,000 townhome. Okay. So now. Oh. Okay. So approach to fiscal neutrality. The city in 2003 adopted a fiscal neutrality policy that says we need to make sure that Alameda point essentially doesn't become a burden to the general fund\nSpeaker 9: that we that we analyze and make sure that the revenues are balanced with the expenses. And these are tax revenues versus city expenditures. So our approach to fiscal neutrality, you know, we have to be thinking talk about this is this is the first development we're not take we're not doing a big master developer for the whole thing\nSpeaker 9: . So we need to be thinking how do we structure this now for this space is, you know, let's set up let's figure out a approach that makes sense that we're going to take and be consistent to take with every development as we go, since we're taking a more incremental approach to development.\nSpeaker 9: So we, James Edison and Will, Dan and myself were keeping that in mind as we kind of went through this is let's let's create a methodology essentially for how we evaluate projects out there to make sure we're complying with this and that we're mitigating any impact.\nSpeaker 9: So I'm going to go over a couple of these are more of a high level kind of approach, and then I'll get into the actual numbers. But obviously let's comply with the policy. Second, we need to actually analyze the net fiscal impacts of Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 9: So that means estimate revenues, estimated expenditures when you compare them, are there any adverse or negative impacts when you compare them? We are taking this approach of fiscal neutrality and we are going to be setting kind of mitigations that are going to be kind of set.\nSpeaker 9: And so what we want to do, whereas we did an analysis on the fiscal impacts of when we did the entitlements for the entire Alameda point, it was for the entire development envelope. What are the impacts in this case?\nSpeaker 9: We think is very important to be very fiscally prudent and use reasonably conservative assumptions in setting this, because we don't you know, we don't know exact these are projections. We don't know exactly what's going to happen over 20 years.\nSpeaker 9: So we want to be on the the conservative side in terms of making our assumptions. So we're so and I'll talk about some of those conservative conservative the biggest conservative assumptions we made in this analysis. And then ultimately we need to mitigate the negative impacts through special taxes and or developer payments.\nSpeaker 9: And I'll talk about that in a second. But special tax is basically you approved this recently for Alameda Landing. It's a community facilities district for services. And that means that property owners are paying more in addition to the 1% property tax that goes towards essentially will go toward to the general fund in the road funds to pay\nSpeaker 9: for maintenance of roads, to pay for fire, to pay for police, and then develop a consistent approach for each incremental development. So developers are kind of clear how this works and the rationale behind it. So what did we do?\nSpeaker 9: First, we determine the net fiscal impacts of the entire Alameda Point project with all the planned facilities using conservative assumptions. So all plan facilities means a new fire station. It means all of the parks that are out there.\nSpeaker 9: And we made one pretty major conservative assumption, which is the entire entitlement value. Me point is five and a half is 1425 housing units. Five and a half million square feet of commercial commercial is beneficial to the the to the to the fiscal mainly because you have impacts that your residents are there both during the day and\nSpeaker 9: the evening. And so they tend to have bigger impacts. And so what we didn't want to do is assume, you know, over 20 or 30 years, we don't know are we going to get 3 million square feet of commercial?\nSpeaker 9: Four and a half, five and a half. So let's be concerned where we are shooting to get as much jobs as possible. But four, since we're setting special taxes and we're trying to be fiscally prudent, let's assume something more conservative.\nSpeaker 9: So we actually assumed a three and a half million square feet of commercial and the 1425 housing units. Obviously, if we get five and a half million square feet of commercial, that is better for the general fund and will be will be a benefit to the general fund.\nSpeaker 9: But since we're setting these special taxes now, we want to be careful because they're not easy to change. So we want to be careful to have conservative assumptions built into how we estimate them. So that result, when we did that analysis, was a $900,000 deficit, mainly not to the general fund.\nSpeaker 9: The general fund was a surplus, but the road fund, a significant new road, Miles. And so when you combine all of the funds that we looked at, the overall deficit was $900,000. Okay? So now we know we've got it.\nSpeaker 9: We've got an issue when we're using conservative assumptions that we need to mitigate because we need to meet that fiscal neutrality policy. So we need to assign every development, their fair share of that deficit. And the site, a fair share of the 900,000 is $311,000 that they that they have agreed to essentially create a special tax that\nSpeaker 9: will generate, at buildout $311,000 annually to the general fund to mitigate their portion of these impacts. And those. So that's the second step. The third step. Biz Well, what about in the beginning years when you might have some facilities but not all the development paying revenues and paying the special tax?\nSpeaker 9: Are there kind of temporal impacts or impacts in the beginning and over time? So let's do another analysis and let's look. In this case, we estimated the net fiscal impacts of each incremental development, obviously in this case site a by phase.\nSpeaker 9: And so what we looked at was phase one, face to face three. In phase one, there are negative impacts even after they pay their share of special tax.\nSpeaker 4: Yashar Can I ask you quick question just before you get to the the different phases? So in the I'm in that paragraph in the staff report, it's on page seven and the section is Results of Fiscal Impact Analysis.\nSpeaker 4: And in the first paragraph down near the bottom is the sentence that so it talks about the development in Alameda point is actually expected to generate a net positive impact on the city's general fund of a certain amount, net positive impact on the city's library fund and a net adverse impact on the city's street related funds of\nSpeaker 4: $1.2 million. And my question was. Explain why the city's street related funds are negatively impacted if the developer is paying so much in backbone infrastructure costs.\nSpeaker 9: Well, because those are what they're paying for. And background infrastructure costs are the capital. This is the cost to maintain the roads and to keep them at a certain level maintained at a certain level. And there are a lot of roads there.\nSpeaker 9: There are a lot of bike facilities or a lot of roads. And so we've estimated all of the different kind of road miles and sidewalks, linear feet and all of that, and determine what it would cost to maintain all those roads.\nSpeaker 9: And there aren't when you look at the street funds, there aren't a lot of dedicated street revenues to to do that. And so in this case, when you combine all those little bridges.\nSpeaker 4: No toll bridges.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, exactly. So it is an impact. So you've got a lot of facilities and not a lot of dedicated revenues to that. So it creates it creates an impact, I think.\nSpeaker 5: So Councilmember Odie and I were just talking about the the net impact and we were just basically distributing the net impact of $300,000 in number to over 800 units. Granted that it's also going to be distributed over commercial as well.\nSpeaker 5: But just just for math sake, right. That comes out to be $375 to which for residents to which I, I thought that the reason why it's kind of low is because you're distributing the net impact over 800. Whereas if you distributed the total impact, it'd be something else.\nSpeaker 9: Correct. Right. I mean, if you because you're mainly netting out all your other revenues. And so it's not just the cost, but you're saying the general funds going to your property tax for sure. You're going to get transfer tax over time.\nSpeaker 9: You get sales tax. We take into consideration all those revenues as well and then compare and then essentially compare them to costs. And how do those compare?\nSpeaker 5: And the reason why that's important to mention is because the Bayport. They're paying $1,000 a year on for MSD. Mm hmm. And all you need to do for those who are so interested in the Internet, just go to their county assessors and you'll see that there's $1,000 for each residents.\nSpeaker 5: And that's the that's basically the CFD MSE for, for Bayport, whatever it is for Alameda landing. I don't know. But.\nSpeaker 3: And you know, I guess my question was, you know, what do we estimate? You know, each parcel that annual tax is going to be or do we not know that now or.\nSpeaker 9: We don't know that exactly. I mean, we ultimately it's it's. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, we, you know, we it's hard because you can it does depend on how you allocate it to commercial versus residential and how we do that.\nSpeaker 9: And the developer, in some cases, commercial development is actually much more sensitive to special taxes than than residential. The way that we kind of structured is that what we said to the developer, we went through an $11,000 a year.\nSpeaker 9: We're going to you're going to have a special tax. Certainly your townhomes are going to have those on them. You know how you figure out how you apportion that special tax. We're going to figure out and you're going to come tell us because we're going to end up approving a CFD ultimately for that.\nSpeaker 9: But what we what we care about most is that we're assured that $311,000 a year.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah, I just was, I think one, I want to clarify one thing. So I think the situation where Bayport was that and this is the genesis of the fiscal neutrality policy is that Bayport at the time was part of redevelopment area where the or the baseline was zero or pretty close to zero.\nSpeaker 5: So everything was was basically tax increment. So that's why you had to capture the for the full value. Whereas I think you're doing your analysis where, where there's some property tax that's coming down Alameda solar so that the 1% ad valorem and the Alamo is 25% share is coming to us.\nSpeaker 5: That's right. But then there's still there's still a discrepancy and that's why we add the brackets.\nSpeaker 9: Right. And. Yeah, exactly. And I think we actually ran a sensitivity because the state has approved things like the infrastructure financing districts. And so we actually ran a sensitivity. If you we don't assume any of these or infrastructure financing districts for that, which is really a reapportionment of that 1% ad valorem tax, if you did this impact\nSpeaker 9: would be much bigger and you'd have to mitigate a much bigger amount. And again, I mean, this these are conservative assumptions that we tried to make throughout the analysis. If you were to if you if we're successful getting five and half million square feet of commercial, there won't be any impact.\nSpeaker 9: I mean, that's what we estimate. There wouldn't be any where we want to be conservative, make sure we're being fiscally prudent. And so we've assumed something that we think's more realistic in the 20 year time frame, the three and a half million square feet.\nSpeaker 9: So let me let me just keep going, but feel free to interrupt. And this is good. It's. So number three is to estimate the net fiscal impact of each incremental development by phase. So for let's just look at side eight and let's look at what facilities are actually built at the time CIDA is built.\nSpeaker 9: So we're not going to assume the fire station. The fire station is not part of the project. It's not necessary. So we're not going to penalize them. The full costs are or pro-rata share of the fire station. They do have to pay an average cost of fire expenditures because they're using fire services.\nSpeaker 9: But we're actually going to just look at the facilities that are actually there inside A to to to try to estimate whether or not there are any kind of incremental or temporal impacts on the general fund that we need to mitigate.\nSpeaker 9: And these would be mitigated through some sort of you know, it wouldn't be through a special tax, be some sort of payment or source because it's kind of a temporary impact. We did this and then we also compared it to one offset it with one time revenues, which are really property transfer taxes.\nSpeaker 9: And I'll show you the analysis on this, but based on pretty significant property transfer tax on just the ownership residential really offsets those impacts in that first year and I'll show you the numbers. But so we we start recommendation is there's no additional mitigation that's required for site A and then we also, you know, this is something\nSpeaker 9: that happens in other cities is if is there a single user that generates a significant amount of tax revenue that could present risk that if it does, it gets delayed or doesn't happen. So for instance, you know, a major retail user in this case, we have no kind of single user retailer that's huge.\nSpeaker 9: That would be generated. But like it out in L.A. would be like a target or something like that. Here we don't have that, but we do have a hotel and hotels generate pretty significant transient occupancy tax. So we did actually take the hotel out and it build out.\nSpeaker 9: You know, there are no there's no there's no impact. There's still site is positive. And I should say our number three overall a build out site A is positive. It generates more revenue to the general fund than it does expenditures.\nSpeaker 9: So I want to make that clear.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. May I take you back to number one under this approach to fiscal mitigation? And so that was determine the net fiscal impacts of the entire on midpoint development. And at the end, it says fiscal analysis in exhibit nine estimates its impact will be a negative annual impact of 871,000 at build out.\nSpeaker 4: Mm hmm. How how how many years is this estimated deficit expected to last? Is that just the year we get to build out?\nSpeaker 9: Or when it when it's at build out, it means build out. So it means kind of the assumption is, you know, that that could be going forward. Going forward. But that doesn't I mean, again, there are a number of factors that could influence that.\nSpeaker 9: The more commercial you get, the more retail sales tax. If there's a major business to business user, you know, there are other factors that could play in here. But we've tried to be conservative in our assumptions. And so that's where that's right.\nSpeaker 9: That that's kind of at build out what the impact would be.\nSpeaker 4: And and.\nSpeaker 9: The annual impact.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. I appreciate that. Is this a deficit page from the general fund? Where is it? Where does it come from?\nSpeaker 9: So the deficit. So let me go to the next slide. So the the deficit, if you take all those funds revenues, the property tax, sales tax, utility users tax, we've estimated all of those expenditures, fire, police, everything. When you kind of net those, you know, compare those, you've got a deficit of the 900,000 that you're talking about\nSpeaker 9: that is and then site A has to mitigate its fair share. And so it's actually paid through a special tax so the general fund. Every development is going to have to pay their fair share of that 900,000. So every development that comes into the city, we're going to say, all right, here's the impacts.\nSpeaker 9: You pay your fair share. The idea is and the methodology is that at the end of the day, once it's all developed, you're going to have sufficient funds to cover any deficit. So that there would be no impact.\nSpeaker 9: Our hope is that everything's wildly successful and all the taxes are even more than we think. And, you know, you're collecting honestly. I mean, you're collecting special tax revenue and you're not having a negative impact because it's much.\nSpeaker 9: But since we don't know and we have to determine it now, we want to be conservative and use conservative protections going forward.\nSpeaker 4: Thanks.\nSpeaker 9: So this is the summary of the.\nSpeaker 0: Oh yeah. Member already.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. So. See if I just understand this correctly. So we're expecting transfer tax and property tax in. The transient hotel tax. And so we're expecting that to come in, in, you know, 17 or 18 or whatever.\nSpeaker 3: We're starting to do all this. And we've already pretty much assigned that revenue to expenditures already. That kind of.\nSpeaker 9: Well, it's just that it comes you know, it's not is some of these revenues you can track to to a specific property like a property tax you kind of know. But it just starts your revenues will start going up your expenses, too, because you'll be having more calls for service.\nSpeaker 9: So things are it's it's not going to happen overnight. Right. But you're going to. Sure, you're going to I mean, probably what you're going to see first are the revenues, right? Because you're going to really start to see a hit and you're going to get property transfer tax revenues.\nSpeaker 9: When all those first townhomes get sold right away, you're going to get a big hit and you'll see the numbers that we've estimated. And then once they once the property tax get on the rolls, you start to see increases in property tax.\nSpeaker 9: But over time, you're going to start to see increases in calls for service and other things and expenditures. So it's not that it's a sign, it's just that you're going to gradually have increases in revenues and increases in expenditures.\nSpeaker 3: And then just for my. Newness at this. So is that going to just sit in the general fund or are we segregating that in like the base re-use or.\nSpeaker 9: No, it will be the general fund. Right.\nSpeaker 3: So we have to be very careful when we get this in that we don't spend it because we know that, you know, it's pretty much spoken for, I guess.\nSpeaker 9: Right. I mean, it's going to the general fund and we need to be aware that there are going to be increases in expenditures over time as well. Absolutely.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 9: So this is I know this is a big tale, but I want to walk through it quickly. So this is the analysis of site. So this was kind of the overall how do we set that special tax? Because we're going to set that special tax.\nSpeaker 9: And it's very difficult to change it once it's kind of in place. And so we're going to require that this amount that they are obligated to pay this amount at build out every year. Then we say again, going back to our methodology.\nSpeaker 9: Let's look at what are the impacts on a temporary basis are. Well, let's look at it by phase by phase for site. When you look at site in total, we're expecting with mitigation that the impacts will be positive to the general thought about $700,000, but they're still paying the 311 every year.\nSpeaker 9: But we think their project, based on the facilities that are in place now or at the end of phase of site, there will be some benefits to the general fund over time. But let's look at it by phase, because things, services and facilities are kind of lumpy.\nSpeaker 9: And so you do see that in that first phase there is kind of a net impact of 500,000. The fiscal mitigation we're estimating would be 200,000. So you've got a temporal impact in that first year phase one, but you're collecting $1.1 million in transfer taxes and then the transfer taxes in phase two.\nSpeaker 9: And this is just for for sale residential. So you may there may also be transfer taxes for other uses, but those are speculative because they may just hold some of those the commercial properties they'll probably hold and not transfer.\nSpeaker 9: So we just assumed, you know what, no transfer tax from that, just the townhomes, essentially, and then the condos and townhomes in the second phase and you get a pretty big hit. And so staff's recommendation is that this these hits and transfer tax more than cover any temporal or temporary deficits that you may have in some of\nSpeaker 9: the earlier phases.\nSpeaker 0: Before you move on. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 2: This. I just want to make a comment that phase three kind of aligns with the purpose smoothing problems that we have. When we go back to the our general fund discussions back a couple of weeks ago. So one of the questions I had is, did your estimates?\nSpeaker 2: To set the tax, anticipate or graduate at the same rate that is driving. When we look at the general fund projections on a downward slope.\nSpeaker 9: So that the special tax is estimated to escalate CPI every year and it has to be tied it's tied to actual cost of maintenance or expenditures of maintenance. So and it will escalate over time.\nSpeaker 2: But not the municipal service tax.\nSpeaker 9: So the municipal service tax will escalate at the CPI.\nSpeaker 2: So it has I'm not going to say an inherent structural defect built in in a way that it doesn't track at the same escalation.\nSpeaker 9: Right. So it.\nSpeaker 2: Doesn't contributions.\nSpeaker 9: Well, right. The the inflation factor will be CPI as opposed to, you know, a city municipal expenditure rate or something like that. It'll be tied to CPI, is that correct?\nSpeaker 0: And Brody.\nSpeaker 3: I think you had Amir. One more. What kind of request? Phase one is 15 through 19, right?\nSpeaker 1: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 3: And then it looks like the bulk of the sales are in 17. I mean, is there some way when when we look at this, we can kind of see, you know, by by fiscal year what the estimated impact on on our general fund is as opposed to buy phase?\nSpeaker 9: Yes. So we can we can break it out. I mean, we can do that. It's a it's we just make assumptions by year. The only reason we didn't do that was just because we didn't want to give a sense, a little bit of false precision, because some of it is, you know, you know, but we can do\nSpeaker 9: it. And if it's analysis you guys would like to see, we're happy to do it. We just, you know, in some ways. Exactly, you know, trying to estimate exactly what's going to be in every year. It starts to get a little, you know.\nSpeaker 9: Well, based on those assumptions.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, two and three, you know, that's going out way far in the future. But I think for for phase one, which is, you know, the first five years, which yeah, you know, we're going to be, you know, this council's going to be setting the budget for.\nSpeaker 3: So it would just be helpful.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. And we can do that. And we can also show you that the transfer taxes, kind of the one time transfer taxes for the for those years as well. So, sure, we can. Absolutely. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm wondering what are your assumptions on your for sale residential? How many of the units are for sale? The residential?\nSpeaker 9: What's in the proforma? So it's, you know, I can pull up the numbers but it's anyone, remember. So I don't remember the exact number but it's whatever is in the perform I think it's.\nSpeaker 3: The 39 townhouse down home.\nSpeaker 2: How many? 139 townhomes. That value sale of 888,000 range. Mm.\nSpeaker 3: Or that's.\nSpeaker 5: It's the Willesden report.\nSpeaker 0: So.\nSpeaker 5: Exhibit 10 to.\nSpeaker 9: 70. So 270 for sale. For sale 274 sale.\nSpeaker 0: Total of. Is about. And that's your phase one. Or is that just overall 270.\nSpeaker 9: Overall for yourself. But but we and we assumed value in tax from all of the units and all the commercial. The only place we kind of limited to for say residential is on the property transfer tax because those are the ones.\nSpeaker 0: So that's what I'm looking at and trying to figure out how you made that calculation.\nSpeaker 9: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: And this is not below market rate, then this is all market rate, right?\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, but that has to be a transfer tax on the the rental building because someone will buy it.\nSpeaker 10: I'm James Edison from Will, then financial services consultant to the city. So what we assumed was so for the recent offer sale, which I think some of the moderate or also some of the moderate or for sale and then the market rate for sale, those are the only units we assumed in what we assumed was a the\nSpeaker 10: city's transfer tax rate, you know, the 12, $12 per thousand valuation. The reason it's a big hit in is because when the first sale happens, every single unit has a transfer tax. After that, it happens as that as a unit.\nSpeaker 10: So it just depends on people's lives. And, you know, that can vary quite a bit. But when when the initial sale happens, when that first family moves in, that means every single unit results in transfer tax. And so it's a it's a big number right out of the gate, but it only happens once.\nSpeaker 10: It's not annual. I mean, it's annual in a sense. It it may occur over several years, but we've calculated for the phase that's sort of a one time payment essentially on the commercial. It really depends on the disposition of the property.\nSpeaker 10: You know, if someone purchases the property, I mean, you can have a transfer tax at that point. But then if they didn't develop it from there and, you know, build their building and do the rest of it, their assessed value will change.\nSpeaker 10: You know, a reassessment will happen, but there won't be any transfer necessarily. So you won't have a transfer tax. You may see those. But in the interest of being conservative, we didn't assume any because they might not happen.\nSpeaker 9: When I was a counselor, you asked about we did assume in the annual cash flow. So this is I mean, those are the one time expenses this row here. When we calculated the model, we do assume a certain amount of all the units in the commercial transfer every year.\nSpeaker 9: But it's a small percentage here. You're talking about all of them, 100% of the for sale units transfer. So you get that big hit over time over on the model, we assume every year some portion of the unit, some portion of commercial turns over and you do get a transfer tax revenue.\nSpeaker 9: You just don't get that big hit like you do in the beginning. So we do assume property transfer tax revenue over time as well.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 9: So I think that's it. I'm happy to answer any any question I have, Joe. I think Joe answered with important point partners wants to just say a couple of things. And then if you have more questions about the fiscal, though, or the financial, you know, I can answer those now.\nSpeaker 9: Yes.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you. And is that so. Let's see. Down on the. Um. Page eight. There's the reference that the tax. My question. Let me just find it. Well, my question is, why is the tax burden higher for residents than for commercial 1.9% versus 1.8%?\nSpeaker 9: All right. That's a good a good question. And so when negotiating the in and the term she was attached to the NRA, there's commercial uses tend to be much more sensitive to special tax, special taxes and whereas residences, you know, honestly, we all I mean, we don't it's it's just a reality where people don't pay as much\nSpeaker 9: attention and they're just not as sensitive to how much of a tax burden there is. And so you're allowed you're able to burden residential users a little more without seeing an impact to value. And again, we kind of use these numbers that are in there, the 1.8, 1.9 to do the analysis.\nSpeaker 9: But the end of the day, what we care about is now that we've done all the technical work we care about, is it $311,000 if they decide they want to kind of prepay that on some of the commercial because they want to lower the burden and they want to put more on the residential.\nSpeaker 9: You know, we can you know, we're kind of allowing some flexibility because now we've kind of done the analysis to figure out what we think those amounts should be. And then and it's not just the municipal services special tax, but it's the team plan and the operations and transit services that they're funding.\nSpeaker 9: It's flood control maintenance, flood control reserve. So there are a number of different things that the city is saying. Our priorities that we want to be collecting funds for from this development to make sure that we're being prudent about maintaining the resources we have out there and providing the services that are so key to the transportation program\nSpeaker 1: . Thanks.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Well, we don't have any speakers.\nSpeaker 9: Which I think I think.\nSpeaker 0: You want to sites with a search.\nSpeaker 9: Yes. Sorry. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, members of the council. Joe Ernst with Alameda Point Partners. We're very pleased to get our planning board approval last week.\nSpeaker 2: Having 29 supporters with varying messages.\nSpeaker 5: A lot of new faces, you know, and we will continue that outreach with the community. There's been a lot of talk about housing, but I want to be clear. You know, we haven't lost our focus about a lot of the things we've heard from the community from the very outset about what the community wants.\nSpeaker 5: Clearly, jobs and the things businesses need, you know, the the parks, the amenities, the housing, the rental, you know, those are things, you know, business. I think this project, you know, we've talk about jobs, but it's also important what it will do for creating jobs at the base, affordable housing.\nSpeaker 5: We have Linda Mammoliti here tonight. I'd like to get her to say a few words, too, about some of the affordable housing.\nSpeaker 2: You know, with the housing.\nSpeaker 5: Again, you know, there's enough here to support the goals to pay for a lot of the things that are in this proforma, that, you know, the things we want. You know, there will be a diversity of housing types.\nSpeaker 5: There's been a lot of questions about different housing types. But we have a, you know, enough here. You know, we using, you know, size of product, you know.\nSpeaker 2: To.\nSpeaker 5: To target a lot of different parts.\nSpeaker 2: Of the market between affordable and market rate.\nSpeaker 5: We've clearly tried to tailor this to, again, demographic that, you know, is going to support transit, that we want to support the retailers, the amenities which are so critical to attracting business. And it's very resource efficient. You know, certainly in our time here of water shortage, I think what's very important with the with site is the.\nSpeaker 2: Capital investment and the message they.\nSpeaker 5: Will send and the importance of of this project.\nSpeaker 2: You know, we've had a chance now to.\nSpeaker 5: Meet with all the businesses out at the point and talk to them about their business and their futures. We've talked to other businesses that have expressed interest in.\nSpeaker 2: You know.\nSpeaker 5: Our project and other things we're working on. You know, it's very clear that a lot of the businesses out there, from Nortel to a county power even right speed.\nSpeaker 2: A new tenant, you know, making very minimal.\nSpeaker 5: Investments in their buildings. And it's largely due to uncertainty about infrastructure. And so I think this, you know, getting city underway is going to send a real strong message to the capital markets, going to send.\nSpeaker 2: A real strong message to these companies.\nSpeaker 5: It's going to send a real strong message to good businesses that we want to locate here. I think, you know, the housing is going to support good transit, both infrastructure and services. And we want to be a catalyst for expanding this throughout the rest of the city.\nSpeaker 5: Again, I'm going to have Elinda talk a little bit about affordable. But, you know, we really want to realize what renewed hope, you know, has achieved with the 25% affordable housing. We've done some preliminary jobs analysis here. And, you know, with site development, we're looking at about 3700.\nSpeaker 2: Construction jobs.\nSpeaker 5: That will translate into about 185.\nSpeaker 2: Million in wages. And, you know, we have in.\nSpeaker 5: The.\nSpeaker 2: In our DDA, you know, we're targeting.\nSpeaker 5: 25%.\nSpeaker 2: Minimum, you know.\nSpeaker 5: Toward, you know, local Alameda residents, Alameda County, and also going to be working with the collaborative for apprenticeships. So, you know, we hope to see a lot of those wages stay right here. You know, permanent jobs, you know, based on the mix of businesses, hotel.\nSpeaker 2: Retail and, you know, the innovation, especially manufacturing.\nSpeaker 5: Looking at about 1700 permanent jobs, of course, sales tax. TOTTY Given the blend of commercial uses, we are making good progress on a project labor agreement with the building trades and we're hopeful we'll have that wrapped up in the next week or so.\nSpeaker 5: And you know, is part of our commitment to bringing jobs.\nSpeaker 2: You know.\nSpeaker 5: Through the lease structures that we've negotiated as part of the DDA, we are committing to at least getting one of those buildings that are in phase in our phase three, getting that redeveloped and activated with phase one.\nSpeaker 2: Building 117, about just under 100,000 square feet.\nSpeaker 5: So again, want to, you know, and a lot of talk about the housing, but clearly want to.\nSpeaker 2: Talk about the.\nSpeaker 5: Many benefits that come from this project. And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to Linda mann Bellini with Eden Housing to say a few words about the affordable.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Madam Mayor.\nSpeaker 1: Members of the council. As Joe said, I'm the president of Eden Housing. I'm happy to be here. I think this is actually in Eden's long term history, one of the best projects that we've been able to participate in.\nSpeaker 1: And I want to tell you why we don't often get asked to be in developments like this in this percentage. Frequently, the other inclusionary ordinances that we work with have 10 to 15%. They never have 25%. And I think the percentage of affordable housing here is actually quite exciting and really exceptional.\nSpeaker 1: And I would applaud the city for that and for that agreement. We're very excited because we can serve a range of affordability with this development and we can serve those who are most in need at the low end, but also take the rents up.\nSpeaker 1: As you saw in the slide that Jennifer put up, we have the ability to create create apartments that are significantly more affordable than the market can provide. And we think it's actually very important that these be rental. And that's largely because the developer here is investing a lot in the infrastructure.\nSpeaker 1: Eden could never be in a project like this and pay for that kind of an infrastructure investment. So the fact that we get to piggyback on that is really important, but it also gives us the opportunity when we do rental housing to leverage the new funds that might be coming from the state.\nSpeaker 1: And I want to say a very special thank you for the yes endorsement vote tonight on 1335 and 35. Both of those are very likely. Both of them are sources that are going to be directed in large part to rental housing and that they will be able to be leveraged on a project like this.\nSpeaker 1: Cap and trade also has a requirement for affordability that is significant. And so we think that it's really important that the affordable be mostly rental housing because we think that that's really the thing that's going to be the most successful financially.\nSpeaker 1: We also.\nSpeaker 4: Think it's the best use.\nSpeaker 1: Of what is in essence subsidy from the larger land development. We can serve more households by doing rental housing than you could if you were doing single family. So for example, if you were to sell a house at $900,000 and make that house affordable to someone at $300,000, the subsidy for that one house would be $600,000 for\nSpeaker 1: one household. For Eden, I could build three houses for that kind of subsidy and maybe four if they were one bedroom. So I think it's just a better use of the subsidy dollars coming from the developer for for us to to do rental.\nSpeaker 1: And so I did want to comment on that because I know there were some questions about that in other places and we're really excited about this. Honestly, I Eden won the Jack Kemp Award from ULI nationally last year for a big master planned development.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm now judging this year for that same competition. And I would tell you this is that kind of a development. It is the kind of development that will get national attention that really has a wide range of affordability.\nSpeaker 1: It affords the folks at the lowest end of the spectrum the opportunity to participate in all of the amenities that you're building. And that's really important. A lot of the developments that we work in, a lot of other communities, they'll take a check from the developer and go build it somewhere else.\nSpeaker 1: But this is really important to be built here. And so I just want to thank you for that because I think this is a really important aspect of the project, and I'm happy to answer any questions about affordability because I know there have been some.\nSpeaker 1: So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Are there any other speakers point f it down with the presentation now. All right. Council members, vice mayor.\nSpeaker 2: Um, you know, I'll start out by saying that I've never been a fan of a town center. Um, I think I've been clear about that. One of the considerations, though, that I do have, and I wanted to make sure that we can verify that other action of the Planning Board was to take the old north housing and\nSpeaker 2: return the housing that's allocated to north housing to what was agreed with in the Navy in 29 at 415 units. And I just want a quick confirmation that when is that going to be? Fortified and established.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. So that will be coming back to the Council on June 16th.\nSpeaker 2: At the same time. And that has a net effect of taking 800 units off the northern waterfront.\nSpeaker 9: Right.\nSpeaker 2: And that and project labor agreement, I think are two key, key things for me. I do have some other other questions and not questions, more comments and direction and things I'd like to see. One of them is I appreciate in-house in coming up here and being a participant in this, but.\nSpeaker 2: I was reading the affordable housing section in the overview of the DDA and that is separate and it's not incorporated in and what we see here in the and these are from our numbers and there is a term in there that talks about their ability or their maximize their potential for obtaining financing.\nSpeaker 2: And I'd like. The risk of them not obtaining sufficient financing not to be on the city. But to be on the developer because part of the promise and we when we hear the input from people part of the promise of this is to deliver 25% of the 800 units as affordable units.\nSpeaker 2: 128 of those are at Eden. And if they're depending on other other sources of of revenue to build these, including state funds. I don't want to get to the end of phase one and they don't have the funds and we not deliver the housing.\nSpeaker 2: So I think that risk should be on the developer and the city can do everything it can to help. But this is this is the promise. And that's what a lot of the support where a lot of the support is coming from.\nSpeaker 2: I'd also like to see. A little more meat behind the leasing and inclusion of jobs in phase one with some milestones because people are going to be living. One thing that's clear is they're going to be townhouses built.\nSpeaker 2: There's going to be an apartment built or apartments built, and eventually they'll be condos built. People will be living there. And one of the best ways to mitigate those people not driving up to the tube or trying to take a bus through the tube or a BRT is to have jobs close by.\nSpeaker 2: On the. The issue of. Having. The ferry. And I've seen that the ferry over the period of this discussion has been reduced to $10 million. And whether or not that's enough to build a ferry terminal. And then whether or not the fairies will come if we build the terminal, I think is still a risk because that's a\nSpeaker 2: promise that's out there that we're going to have a fairy. But I haven't seen a commitment yet from Wheaton to run a fairy. If we build a terminal and I don't know if $10 million can build the terminal, it doesn't sound like it.\nSpeaker 2: So that's another risk that we have in front of us that I'd like to push the push in another direction and it falls under transportation. There are a couple of things that we have to make sure that we do reality based transportation demand management.\nSpeaker 2: And I think one of that demands that we address the issue that keeps popping up, that there is only going to be one additional cars through the tubes at peak time. And whether or not that's true or not.\nSpeaker 2: I don't think it's true. But we have to get some numbers that are bona fide that say what what it's like today so that we can project it out on what we have to mitigate as these units become populated.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that is extremely important to have credibility when we're charging people who are going to be buying these units a substantial amount of money to transport them. Off the island if they have to work off the island.\nSpeaker 2: And then lastly, I mentioned the project labor agreement. I think it's very important to have these jobs local and I'm glad progress is being made. And that truly is a condition, I think that we have to stand by because it's public land.\nSpeaker 2: It's been used for this project. So those those are my comments and my input for tonight.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 4: I have a clarifying question on the statement about the reality based transportation planning and beside of you come up. Okay. I have definitely read in the newspaper from a local commentator that somewhere it said that Alameda Point development is only going to put one more car through the tube.\nSpeaker 4: Wasn't my understanding of what the report actually said. Is it not something more like the capacity only has room for one more to one more car through the tube? Do you want to state it?\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, I do.\nSpeaker 4: Completely that I am.\nSpeaker 9: Sure. I mean, the Aluminum Point Environmental Impact Report studied, I think 32 intersections, the impacts to 32 intersections in in Alameda and then a number in Oakland as well. And what it showed was that there will be, you know, with or without made a point, there are going to be significant impacts given all the regional growth.\nSpeaker 9: Aluminum point, as you know, there are impacts that Alameda Point contributes to. There are significant impacts. No one is saying that there's only one Alameda point generating one car. That's just not right. Absolutely. Will be generating cars. What happens is what that what that person.\nSpeaker 9: Kind of taking data. What it shows is that the tubes are essentially what kind of confirms and in a lot of ways what a lot of us know already, which is the tubes are generally essentially reaching capacity. Now, when you add more cars, what ends up happening, this is what you see in the analysis that was done\nSpeaker 9: is when you add more cars on the Western people that are driving from the, you know, the middle of the island or Eastern don't go into the tubes anymore. The tubes are capacities. What we would all do if you know intuitively they're going to they now then go to intersections on the East End.\nSpeaker 9: And so where you actually see a lot of the impacts in the traffic impact analysis are on the eastern around the Park Street Bridge, around the other crossings because people who would be kind of driving into the tubes today, let's say as the regional growth occurs, other growth occurs in Alameda, the tubes are going to reach capacity\nSpeaker 9: . And that's what the models are saying, is that your tubes only have so much traffic, you know, in there. And so what you see is they actually have spreading of traffic and then traffic that's diverting to other parts of the island.\nSpeaker 4: And thank you for that clarification, because it upsets me every time I see this reported in the newspapers, not so much reporting, but sometimes as an opinion piece and sometimes it gets front page coverage. But I just want us on the council when we're talking to the public to to have an understanding of what that means.\nSpeaker 4: And, of course, it ties into so much of what we've discussed already tonight about the need for getting the funding that we have the ability to apply for through the Alameda County Transportation Commission, both the federal grants and the state matching grants.\nSpeaker 4: And we're not burying our head in the sand. We're saying we do need to look at another model, which is giving people the opportunity to live and work in the same area and getting people who work out of the area, out of their single occupancy vehicles and on to public transit.\nSpeaker 4: But we have to make that possible. And we heard some very good opportunities tonight that are coming to us the best rapid transit and increased funding for ferry and other public transportation. Thank you there for that clarification.\nSpeaker 0: And I just.\nSpeaker 5: Want to add on that very important point about the increase of traffic from Alameda point as it flows, particularly through the outbound Posey Tube in the morning. On the when we decided the air, we actually discussed and evaluated that.\nSpeaker 5: And it was largely because when I was looking at the appendices, I did, in fact take a look at the circles that they had, the schematics and kind of said, okay, look, there's there seems to be something odd about the certain number of of cars going through the posi tube in one scenario relat.\nSpeaker 5: And then when you look at the cars going through the Posey tube, in another scenario, there didn't seem to be that much and there wasn't that much for the reason given by MZ Art this afternoon. This evening. And it was given back then when we discussed the air.\nSpeaker 5: Now, what we also did, though, is we also did back then when we discussed the air and said.\nSpeaker 6: Well, what.\nSpeaker 1: If we're.\nSpeaker 5: Wrong? So back in 2014, what we did in accepting the air and also doing the MIP or the mast master infrastructure plan for Alameda Point, we also had a failsafe just in case something didn't happen, didn't go as we had wanted to.\nSpeaker 5: So that is part of the discussion. That is part of the of the things that came out of the whole nip in the air for Alameda point discussion for that happened in 2014. So let it not be said that this council did not evaluate that very specific information that that is now, you know, gaining currency here in\nSpeaker 5: 2015. We discussed it in 2014 and however imperfectly, we made some policy decisions with regard to that. So if I maybe I'll just continue with some of my points. Okay. My points for tonight based upon this is again on transportation.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you very much for the changes that I saw. Once again, I love that 15 minute headway for the shuttle. I know it's not this answer to everything. And I know, you know, consultants said not to not to glom onto it, but I did.\nSpeaker 5: But also, the other changes that that were made was to make sure that, you know, we'll talk about three things about the shuttle possibly stopping at one or some other place. So I'm glad to see that language in the in the team.\nSpeaker 5: I think in going through the materials for this evening, I think that the my quick notes that I had was make sure that we have language that protects us and our interests. And our interest, for example, are like the sports complex.\nSpeaker 5: Make sure that we have a language that protects us in our interests in this development in the event of a recession. Now, everything that is had indicated tonight is that that will be part that is part of the DDA.\nSpeaker 5: So remember, she talked about, you know, economic force majeure and all those kind of things, because we do have however the project goes in terms of the sales, whether the commercial sales or whether the rental or whether the single family I mean, the the sales for those are subject to the markets at the time and markets at\nSpeaker 5: the time could be down. So however, the on the revenue side, those things go. We ourselves as a city want to see some cost that we want. We want to see costs like that, like the sports complex. So we don't want to do you know, we don't want to sacrifice those.\nSpeaker 5: And I think every everything that MDOT has indicated is that we've taken that into account. We also want to take into account the fact that, you know, we're going to hire more police officers, we're going to have more more fire people.\nSpeaker 5: And we might even, one assumes, some of those costs ahead of time. For example, you can't have half a half of a fire station. Right. So so, you know, you have to make a decision. So as we assume these costs, we want to make sure that we've factored in, you know, well, what if, you know, all of\nSpeaker 5: the property values go down because we have all these assumptions with regard to how revenues offset the costs and we have all these assumptions with regard to the impact fee that we're going to use. So but everything that to me suggests that they they're modeling that into into a DDA.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Land banking, as always. One of the big issues that we learned from the Bay Port Alameda landing. So hopefully that will make sure to have a discussion about that things that I also want to take a look at a.\nSpeaker 5: Flushing out the corporate entity of who will be working with. A lot of times you want to know, you know, the corporate entity with who you're working with just in case things go wrong and you know, you just want to know things.\nSpeaker 5: And I like the that the extension payments that Miz was talking about. I just I think the question that I just wrote here was, are they automatic, though? And if we could just flesh that out later on. And also the mechanism, as I indicated earlier, kind of understanding the mechanisms for how we're going to score the IRR\nSpeaker 5: , because a lot of that is a function of, you know, what we think are the costs that the developer or whomever is assuming as an equity investment need of a project. So, you know, I mean, we got we got to make sure that we understand that.\nSpeaker 5: And I guess the last thing I have in mind is from the outset is I had indicated a variety of things that we're going to be deciding on on June 16th. One of the things that we as a council might want to think about is including the development plan itself.\nSpeaker 5: And the only reason why I would include the development plan, which was discussed by the planning board and voted on by the planning board. The only reason I would raise the possibility of including the development plan as part of the June 16th discussion is if for no other reason, for its ceremonial reasons.\nSpeaker 5: I mean, it is after all, you know, it's a it's a development plan for a key part of Alameda Point, which has taken us decades literally to get to this point. So from a ceremonial perspective, you know, to say hats off to former Mayor Withrow, former mayor opposed to former Mayor Johnson and and Maria Gilmore and all\nSpeaker 5: the previous councils, it's altogether possible that maybe we should have the council at least vote on the development plan as opposed to leaving it just to the Planning Board as part of our June 16th discussion. So largely for ceremony reasons, I get that that the development plan would probably be woven into the DDA.\nSpeaker 5: I understand that, you know, but we might have it. Think about that if for no other reason than ceremonial reasons as to why it should be included. Well, as my comments.\nSpeaker 0: Member, Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mary Spencer. I want to thank the missus and the other presenters in Ms.. Madeleine. If I'm saying your name correctly, that was really inspiring to hear from you. And to that, the project we're aspiring to do at its site is it sets the bar high, even by the projects you've seen.\nSpeaker 4: And I like that. I we got a lot of external correspondence from various people actually supporting one of the letters. I was really impressed with and I'm just going to read it tonight. So it's, it's in their record in heard by the public because I think it really sums up a lot of of why we're doing what\nSpeaker 4: we're doing. So it says my husband Dan Corea and I are Olympians and retired employees of NASA Alameda. I was on the first brand committee for years working to decide what the best could and should become after closure.\nSpeaker 4: Dan worked his last year performing hazardous waste cleanup around the base. I spent my last years in the active center in building one or one, helping people find and apply for new jobs. Dan and I recently went on a tour of what is planned for the Seaplane Lagoon site.\nSpeaker 4: We were filled with hope at what could be done with this tired old base of ours. I remember. I remember when it seemed that the task of bringing the base back to life was just too daunting. Now we see that not only can new life happen, but this plan for society could honor our former base.\nSpeaker 4: Incorporation of existing buildings into the development plan would allow our history to continue into the future. At the same time, we have been watching as too much development seems to be changing. Alameda from the community we once knew.\nSpeaker 4: We think we have gone too far in changing neighborhoods that were not seeking their change. But we still think that the one place that does cry out for development is our old base. The proposed development there will not take away from what Alameda is.\nSpeaker 4: It is development that is sorely needed to allow that crumbling base to become something better than it is now. This is a plan for new life. We endorse it. Carol Fairweather and Dan Corea. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member, Odie.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'll try to be brief, because I think almost every comment that I've wanted to say has been said already. So she ate my my colleague's comments. I just want to focus on a couple of things.\nSpeaker 3: One, I'm glad that there's progress on the play, and hopefully I'd like to see that resolved by now. But I hope that you're getting into the nitty gritty of the negotiations and are able to report back soon that that's been taken care of.\nSpeaker 3: I was encouraged by the the acceleration of the commercial development. The point was made about we need to make sure we get jobs there sooner rather than later. And that I don't think we can underestimate the importance of the north housing realignment of of housing in our in a housing element.\nSpeaker 3: And I think I really want to commend the vice mayor for his leadership on this issue, because what it what this allows us to do is to consider this project in a way such a way that, you know, we're not adding housing to our housing element, where we're going to be able to consider this within the context\nSpeaker 3: of our housing element and not go over and build. You know, I guess I would call extra housing. So again, very, very strong and effective leadership on that issue by our vice mayor in bringing this this whole realignment idea to the council and to the staff back early in the year.\nSpeaker 3: So. That's basically my my comments. I'm glad that we've finally seen the financials. You know, we we saw the pro forma and closed a while ago. But I'm glad that, you know, the public now has an opportunity to review those.\nSpeaker 3: And, you know, this is, you know, where other projects have struggled when the public has had an opportunity to drill down and pick apart the financials. So I hope they they take the time. I mean, we've had 12 days already, but hopefully the public will continue to look at these critically and, you know, provide comments to us\nSpeaker 3: . I still have yet to hear a speaker at council opposed to this. So if you're out there, hopefully we don't hear someone come and say we need more time. You know, we haven't talked about this enough because there has been ample opportunity both at the planning board, other commissions and council, you know, to voice concerns.\nSpeaker 3: So I hope we don't we don't see a parade of people telling us that, because I think that's a little disingenuous after after all the hard work is that you have done and staff has done. So that's kind of my thoughts where we are right now.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And I appreciate the comments and the presentation. And I have received emails from people that are adamantly opposed to any housing, especially on because that would flow through the two. I think they are out there and I and and.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 0: Personally in regards to traffic, that is a big issue of mine. When I look at this, though, it's things that the prior counsel gave this exclusive negotiate an agreement to this company with the 800 homes, which means. I am looking for how the traffic will be addressed.\nSpeaker 0: I see this property as a gift to our meetings large. As much as I want jobs and to have something done at the point, I think that at the end this has to benefit all our meetings. A comprehensive transit has to be addressed.\nSpeaker 0: I'm concerned that, you know, I voted against hiring a consultant to look at that. I think we have to address this bus shuttle transit. And I know we have our business allies that have already said this sooner rather than later.\nSpeaker 0: The traffic through the tube is too much. This cannot within our ability, it cannot contribute any more to that. And yes, it does flow across the island all the way across the island. It is a serious problem. So how do you put an 800 homes and have it have as low impact as possible on our roads?\nSpeaker 0: And I think we have to be very mindful of that. And I'm not sure we're there. I'm just going to raise these issues and I'm hoping everyone can be thinking about this. How are we really doing this? Barry The ferry.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I checked Richmond. They said their ferry was 42. They were just. That just happened 40 to 50 million. And that's on line is what they're estimating for their terminal. And we're talking about 10 million. I don't know what the deal is.\nSpeaker 0: And then we have our dredging costs of I feel like that is very immature unless in there's someone's got this information. What is the deal is we they're going to put in how much money. How much is the dredging?\nSpeaker 0: Is this 10 million going to make a difference? And then I'm going to ask this question of staff, how much parking is being said, set aside for the ferry right there by the ferry. How many spaces are there?\nSpeaker 9: 400 spaces.\nSpeaker 0: 400? Okay. How many cars do we think? Well, I'm going to compare that to Harbor Bay. Do you know how many spaces are there or how many? We have a big problem at the Harbor Bay Ferry right now.\nSpeaker 0: Do you have any idea how many spaces are there?\nSpeaker 9: I don't know. Do you know?\nSpeaker 0: Or the main street ferry? Do we know how many cars?\nSpeaker 9: Main Street? I think it's like 700.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So if Main Street is 700 and this is 400, then that's significantly less.\nSpeaker 9: Than it is. But we're expecting a lot of people to actually live and walk to the ferry or ride their bikes to the ferry and other things. So we're while we're one of the reasons we're putting it in the seaplane lagoon, at the heart of the development is to try to get all the, you know, people moving\nSpeaker 9: there that want to take ferries so that they won't be driving. It doesn't mean the people.\nSpeaker 0: There.\nSpeaker 9: Will be people driving. And we don't I'm not saying that no one's going to drive at all. It's just that we're hoping to really maximize the the.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I like to I appreciate that. So I'd like to know how many parking spaces that Harbor Bay. And I know we've got an excess of cars that use that one and I.\nSpeaker 4: Appreciate their main street ferry terminals will be open to.\nSpeaker 0: Correct, but I am concerned about building a ferry that serves just this area. Why? Because when I look at the housing, I think we are not building what I want to call workforce housing. I think you've got below market rate and I think you have a majority of higher end and.\nSpeaker 0: And and this is at least $10 million. I, I think it's going to cost. I don't know what the deal is, where the rest of the money is going to come from. I don't think 10 million is going to cover it at all.\nSpeaker 0: So. But. Okay, the sports complex, what is the total cost for the sports complex? We're getting 5 million from this development. What's the rest of it?\nSpeaker 9: We have in the master infrastructure plan is $20 million.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And where is that? Where's the other 15 million going to come from?\nSpeaker 9: From other phases of development.\nSpeaker 0: So when will that be? What's the time like before we actually have families that get to use the sports complex.\nSpeaker 9: Well, you mean when will we get the rest of the money first? Right.\nSpeaker 0: When is it going to be built? Because this is for our community. You're setting aside 5 million for something that I think truly will benefit our community at large. Mm hmm. And where's how. What's your timeline? I'm going to want to this one.\nSpeaker 9: On the red. It's going to depend on the timeline for the rest of the development that's really subject to the city council desire to dispose and develop plan. So. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: So if we don't have any estimate for that, then I sounds like we shouldn't be holding our breath for when we're going to actually get a sports complex. They may be putting up the $5 million, but we're not going to see anything.\nSpeaker 0: And.\nSpeaker 1: But if I may, similar to other park projects, it's also feasible to do things in stages, and we've talked about that with the sports complex. So for example, that's something I'm doing with Estuary Park will be doing phase one and phase two.\nSpeaker 1: Sweeney Park will be probably 4 to 5 phases.\nSpeaker 6: So it's not that we necessarily need to raise the entire.\nSpeaker 1: 20 million before we even begin building and opening to the public.\nSpeaker 0: So I will be looking for more information in regards to how we're going to have something that the public can use. I think that's very important. And and I see the sports complex, at least at this point. Do we know how many parking spaces and will be at the sports complex and what that really we have any\nSpeaker 0: idea about when we say sports complex, what that is?\nSpeaker 1: We've not done any detailed design on the sports complex.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: We have it'll depend on how many fields, what type of fields, what types of amenities.\nSpeaker 6: So there's it's it's really.\nSpeaker 1: 44 acres of blank space for us to work within at this point.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I think that our community does feel like we have a shortage of sports fields and that that is a big concern for our community. I don't know if our community at large thinks that we need actually, I have been talking to people about the theory and I thought a good comment that came up was we\nSpeaker 0: have a ferry at Harbor Bay and we already have one at the point, but we have nothing in the middle and that's actually a big part of where our residents live. So if we were pulling back and we were thinking where to serve Alameda and would we want a if we wanted another ferry, where would we want\nSpeaker 0: it to be? I'm not sure we would want it a mile, a mile and a half from an existing ferry. And I'm hoping that we can come up with. So so when I look at this, I'm thinking that this goes to our meetings.\nSpeaker 0: A large and the sports complex may very well be a better use of the money so that we actually get something. And I and I know there's. Apparently people that live in these homes. And, you know, we're trying to encourage people to ride their bikes all over, but to ask them to ride their bike a mile or\nSpeaker 0: a mile and a half, maybe out of the equation, that they need a ferry that they can just quickly ride their bikes to or watch. And I'm not sure that that's correct. Actually, I would submit that's not correct.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm not sure that that's really the need. Overall, workforce housing, there is a need for what I'm going to call housing for middle income people, whatever that is. I'm not sure that that is being addressed here, and that is a big issue in regards to whatever type of jobs are being put here.\nSpeaker 0: Is this the housing that will support those people, whatever if we're doing retail? And I would I would submit that they're not going to be able to afford most of this housing. So whatever I think, if possible, the jobs that are brought in should match a line with the housing because that will in fact reduce your traffic\nSpeaker 0: . If the we don't have to have people driving on and off of the island driving, they can work. I think that's ideal. We're looking for people that can work and live there. Okay. The percentage and the water issue, that's a big issue.\nSpeaker 0: But I appreciate the work that's been done on that because we all know we're in a drought and Allen meetings are being impacted by that. So that's that. I appreciate that work. The percentage of these homes that are being leased as opposed to by now, the comments in this report go to there hasn't been that much new\nSpeaker 0: rental housing built. But I've noticed what I think happens is that we have single family homes that are sold and then some people turn around and lease them. So they did not initially get put out to be leased.\nSpeaker 0: But that's what happens. And you have many if you look at Bayport, for instance, there are people there that are that are renting. It didn't start as a rental. But what is nice about that for a city is that when a Prop 13 benefits or for IT owners of property long term because they're they don't have a\nSpeaker 0: change they're able to have a corporation hold the rental property and they may change on people that are working there or whatnot. But over time they're still holding that corporation, still holding the property, which means the value is not being reassessed.\nSpeaker 0: That occurs when the property is sold and when an individual eyes a house, then they rent it out. Then then the property is going to have more turnover and that benefits our community. Time and the timing of the property long term in a long in a lease situation like that when we're talking about such a high percentage\nSpeaker 0: . That concerns me. And I and I disagree with the suggestion that you don't have new rentals just because you're not doing a rental apartment building. We have many people that rent homes and or we don't really have that many condos, but they rent homes.\nSpeaker 0: And in fact, I think we have overall higher percentage of rentals in our community compared to other communities in the Bay Area. And yet this is correct, and that we don't have that many apartment buildings, but we have lots of rentals regardless.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. The roads, what they're going to actually look like. I recently had the opportunity. Thank you to the bicycling enthusiasts to meet one of the mayors from Copenhagen who talked about how they do designing of roads and and they don't they don't actually don't do cycle tracks they try to do the same direction as the cars, but\nSpeaker 0: they do but they design it intentionally so that you have roads that accommodate your drivers as well as a lot of bicyclists and walk and people that are walking different modes of transportation. And I think that if someone can look at what they're doing, actually that's what this meeting was about.\nSpeaker 0: The many of a few of us had the opportunity, including staff. I think we have to be more focused on trying to make it work when we have our bicyclists and our walkers and our cars, cars sharing the same roads, senior housing that continues to come up, how will this housing accommodate seniors?\nSpeaker 0: And that also goes to universal housing. One thing I have noticed with tri level homes over by target is that the washer and dryer can be on the top floor, which and there'll be a room on the whatever floor you enter on if it's the first floor, the second floor.\nSpeaker 0: But I think it's important to have the washer and dryer on whatever the main floor is with that bedroom so that your person that is limit has limited mobility can actually exist on one floor of a tri level home, if that's what we're doing.\nSpeaker 0: Trial of a home's. Chuck routes I'd like to see and that may be in here exactly how our truck routes are going to be set up because we have that read a maintenance facility. Where the roads are going to be cutting across through this development if they're coming across this development at all.\nSpeaker 0: To get the field to the wheel building and hopefully they don't have to go through this housing development to get their. Okay. And when I looked at the overall chart, I think it was exhibit 11, which I appreciate.\nSpeaker 0: The single family homes, 125 of them, 850,000 was the number here. And this is beyond your development. But in regards to staff and it does connect to this development because 125 of the homes, single family, 850,000 townhomes, 300 800, 795,000.\nSpeaker 0: That's 425. But I'm going to call high end homes out of. 497 homes to buy their condos. 72 condos, 72 condos, 300 townhomes, 100,000, 72 condos or 540. Okay. That could be in the middle that I'm going to call middle, but that's only 72.\nSpeaker 0: You've got 425 that are 800,000 or higher. That's approximately 85% of what to buy is what I'm going to call high end or luxury overall. I don't think that's going to reflect our jobs. I don't think that reflects our community.\nSpeaker 0: I see that as a problem. The apartments. You've got 400, 526 apartments. That are not the low and very low, the low and very low apartments. I can understand and appreciate the comments that we need those to be apartments to provide the services and make it work, and then that benefits the people that are living there.\nSpeaker 0: I'm not sure that this division of. 425 high end.\nSpeaker 1: Homes.\nSpeaker 0: 72 condos, and then 526 apartments that are relatively expensive because we're not going to be able to we will not have rent control there ever. That will always be market rate per state. We would have to change something at the state level, which means that's a high percentage that we can't we can't control.\nSpeaker 0: Now, if we did moderate, if we did more condos change this up somehow, then I think you have a better chance of taking care of people. But then middle income, how many cars will actually be generated from this project?\nSpeaker 0: It's going to be a significant number. They will be driving through that tube. They will not all take the ferry. You take the ferry to get to San Francisco. You don't take the ferry to go to Oakland. Yes, some people will be riding their bike to Oakland, not currently through the tube there.\nSpeaker 0: Not not very many cars will be generated. Okay. To me, the only reason it makes sense to have to offset this traffic that I see is a big issue is if in fact we're addressing some of the issues that Alameda INS have and I'll and what I hear is Alameda instead of being pushed out of this town\nSpeaker 0: because they cannot afford to stay here which means this housing somehow has and seniors. Somehow I think that. Okay there's your balance. If the housing that we're producing will address the needs of our maidens or mere the jobs somehow so that we're not just ending up with housing for people that.\nSpeaker 0: Well are your high, high income families or individuals because that does not reflect Alameda. And when I hear about the ferry, I'm thinking that's your ferry that aligns with your high end housing. And then what about the people in the middle?\nSpeaker 0: How does this project help them? Those are my concerns. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: I think if I could just comment quickly in terms of the current housing scenario, I think the 5000 feet picture of as to why Joe Ernst and Company or even if you look at Bayport, why Bayport turned out the way it is.\nSpeaker 5: And, you know, you need to take a look at, for example. Ron Cowans Project Alpha at Harbor Bay Isle or when Dawn Parker started. Marina Village. You know, back in the seventies, these guys were rebuilding. I mean, Dawn Parker, when he put together Marina Villas, they were building basically on, you know, areas where there was really nothing\nSpeaker 5: . Marina Village was kind of a dump. What's it called? Harbor Bay was, you know, just kind of open land. It's like, you know, Bay, before we was a farm. I think the challenge for any developer, whether it's Joe Ernst or Catalist or whomever, when it comes Alameda point, is that this is important for the public to understand\nSpeaker 5: is that we're basically doing brownfield development. And what that means is that, you know, there's a certain amount of investment that's created that's required just to get to the gate, just to get the property to the to be developable state.\nSpeaker 5: So right off the bat, that almost doubles the cost of of of whatever project that you're involved in because it's not only laying down the infrastructure that's required to support development, but it's actually tearing out the awful stuff that's already there on the ground.\nSpeaker 5: And by virtue of that, you know, that doubles the cost. You're going in, you're tearing it out, and then you're going to put back, you know, things that that are needed. So in order to deal with kind of this brownfield development that, say, Ron Cowen didn't have to deal with over at Harvard or or Don Parker didn't\nSpeaker 5: have to deal with over at Marina Village. Don Parker, by the way, was our first R.A., our executive director. In order to deal with these on the revenue side, on the revenue generating side, you do have to have a certain program that does that does entail, you know, $800,000 homes, townhomes.\nSpeaker 5: I mean, those are expensive, no doubt. And I couldn't afford it. I mean, I'm glad I can afford what I have. But, you know, that's the challenge of doing Alameda point, of dealing with very real infrastructure related problems.\nSpeaker 5: And on top of that, dealing with the social issues that we as a city have decided to embrace. One of those social issues being the 25% set aside for affordable housing, for very low income people and low income people.\nSpeaker 5: And that by virtue of that, as the representative from Eaton Housing said, you know, the city of Alameda is making these decisions that have implications with regard to how you develop the rest of Alameda point to deal with these social cost issues, to deal with infrastructure cost issues, to deal with the transportation issues.\nSpeaker 5: So, you know, I understand, you know, a lot of people have concerns about housing and they want to see workforce, moderate income housing. I understand that. And I think we have in Joe Ernst and SRM and all the different partners.\nSpeaker 5: Sorry, I don't mean to just always say Mr. Ernst, but we do have people who are, you know, struggling mightily to to meet the objectives, the many varied objectives that we, as the residents have indicated that we want.\nSpeaker 5: But, you know, there's there's so much give that the project can take, can give. And and I think, you know, the effort that MBS art has done in putting together the staff and the and the Fiscal Impact Analysis Report indicates that, you know, this is a very tight project and we're at a late portion of this development\nSpeaker 5: process where it's very, very difficult to load on new objectives. You know, in terms of dealing with the rental housing crisis of right now, you know, I'm not going to oversell the argument. I'm not going to say just because you build more rental housing.\nSpeaker 5: Therefore, you know, as the typical market based approach says, you know, that the supply of rental housing and everything is going to be great, that, you know, equilibrium, market equilibrium is going to reach a certain point and suddenly housing be affordable once again.\nSpeaker 1: Maybe it won't work.\nSpeaker 5: Out like that. I mean, other people have different theories. The guy who does Case-Shiller, you know, he says, you know, sometimes the market doesn't work that way. So. I think we're doing a yeoman's effort here, not just SRM, but also all the people who brought us to this this point in dealing with the infrastructure cost related issues\nSpeaker 5: and dealing with the transportation issues. And by virtue of that, there are real life implications in terms of the program that that one we're putting together, that that type of housing. And at some point in time, we're going have to make a decision and finally move forward, because it's been 21 years now.\nSpeaker 0: And member Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. And if I could just add, I appreciated Councilmember de Suggs remarks, and I think there's a temptation when we're creating this new project just for creating something out of nothing or a lot of, you know, really bad things that have been cleaned up and remediated and whatnot.\nSpeaker 4: And there is a tendency to want to solve all of our problems in one fell swoop with this this project. And we're not going to be able to do that for a number of reasons. Can we get closer to solving some of the problems and the issues before us and in contributing to this community?\nSpeaker 4: Sure. And that's where the recreational opportunities come in. And the transit dollars and I, I and I appreciated Mr. Aldrich's comments about we can phase parks. That's what she does for a living. She creates parks and she's seen that it doesn't all happen at once, but you can still create some in a recreational area.\nSpeaker 4: But if we don't do this at all, all of that is off the table. So, you know, we have to to weigh carefully what it is we we preserve and what it is we throw away if we decided not to go down this path.\nSpeaker 4: But I think we also shouldn't lose sight as a council of the kinds of solutions we can work closer toward right now. And for instance, we've talked a lot about affordable rents and, you know, people being priced out of this town because they can't afford their rents.\nSpeaker 4: I hope that soon the rental ordinance that we contemplated and was sent back for some tweaking, I hope that'll come back to us soon and I hope it will be passed unanimously by this council because I really feel bad for the folks who were hoping that we would have passed it back when it came to us before\nSpeaker 4: . But that's something we can make a dent in now, is to at least make sure that people are not being priced out of their home there, their rental units, without at least some fair hearing to to see whether or not that's a just increase and have some attempt at having their case heard.\nSpeaker 4: So there's some things we can actually do now that are right in front of us. There's some great things out there potential in the future. But we I agree. When Mr. De Sykes said we just have to resist the temptation to load on more and more expectations of this because I think we've loaded quite a bit on\nSpeaker 4: already. But anyway, I I'm really appreciative of every time this comes before us for an update, we've got more detail and it'll help us make that much more an informed decision next month. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 2: One more comment. The negotiations are not over. I mean. The D-Day is in front of us. So I'm hoping that our input is being. I'm sure it is. It's being heard. And I think the mayor raised some points of basically stretching the envelope of what the mix would be.\nSpeaker 2: And we need to hear what comes back from that. I, I think I added some on trying to load risk of if in housing can't get their financing, we're still going to deliver the 128 units and we're not going to deliver it.\nSpeaker 2: I must I want to see what we can negotiate that the developer delivers it and that in that failsafe scenario. So I think these are all points that have to be carried back to the bargaining table and the the mix has to be stirred so that we can, again, get get this thing delivered, but delivered to fulfill\nSpeaker 2: a promise that is that it offers.\nSpeaker 0: So we are, as I understand, this comes back June 16th, right? Okay. Is this the last meeting before it comes back to us or will there be another meeting?\nSpeaker 1: I think this is the final meeting.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So in regards to whether or not my council members think this is good or bad, I appreciate anyone that wants to weigh in and explain why you think it's a great idea. I tried to be very honest, but my concerns have been I've been raising these concerns for a long time, and I continue to think that\nSpeaker 0: we have to address more than the people at the below market and the people at the high. And that's all I'm doing is I'm putting it out there is at the end of the day, there needs to be four people that agree to this project.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Any other comments? So that's now number seven, City Manager Communications. Right.\nSpeaker 1: We have none.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Number eight. And we don't have any other public comment. We have number nine, council referrals. And number ten, council communication.\nSpeaker 7: Mr. Horn, remind the.\nSpeaker 1: Audience here.\nSpeaker 7: For the street bridge is closed. So trying to leave the island, you have to take alternative means.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All right. Appreciate that. Council communications member Odie.\n",

Recommendation to request city attorney to prepare an audience and resolution to designate the VIP record sign located at 1014 is Pacific Coast Highway as a historical landmark District six.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. We do. We have a motion on the floor, but we're going to go and do a short staff report, I believe. So let me just turn this over to Mr. West.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mayor Councilmembers. This is a fantastic night to declare a historic monument. Weren't turning this over to Christopher Koonce.\nSpeaker 0: Who will walk us through the item. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and members of the council. I know we have many folks waiting from the public, so I'm going to run through a couple of slides as quickly as possible.\nSpeaker 0: We're talking about VIP records, which is at the intersection of PCH and Martin Luther King. Here's another appeal. They're at King and PCH near the high school. So a little bit of background on the VIP records sign and its current location.\nSpeaker 0: Strip Mall was built in this location in 1962. The sign came quickly later and you'll hear more about that tonight in 63. During the 1970s, before we could take the mic and improve it. Rap really started, Mara, as an East Coast phenomenon.\nSpeaker 0: The IP records opened in 1979. You see the rise of hip hop and rap as a West Coast phenomenon during the 1980s. And you also see really challenging gang and other challenges in central Long Beach during the eighties and dissipating in the 1990s.\nSpeaker 0: So that brings us to today. In 2016, VIP records contemplated closure or relocation. In May of 2017, this council authorized funds for preservation and relocation of the VIP record sign assisting the business and side owner. With that, in June of 2017, VIP records filed for a landmark status for the iconic sign.\nSpeaker 0: And in November of this year, the York Cultural Heritage Commission recommended that this body make the VIP record sign into a local landmark. So the sign itself is of what we call the Googie style, which you see throughout sort of an earlier period, 1940s to 1960s, and we see it in a later example in the sign.\nSpeaker 0: So while it's a static sign, it evokes sort of a sense of movement and activity. It's a combination of metal and Plexiglas, and it's oriented in east west direction. Here's a picture of the sign. I think we all know it because not only of you driven by it, but it's an iconic piece of album.\nSpeaker 0: Album covers, music videos and our sort of shared cultural history and pop culture. It's just a different view of it. And the sign has remained. While colors are different, things have changed over time has remained basically the same.\nSpeaker 0: Not as many tapes sold in the later period. More cities. But it's a bad sign, as has been a fixture here in Long Beach throughout its history. So I think you really cannot think about VIP records without thinking about the history, about music here in Long Beach and about thinking about the man behind VIP records.\nSpeaker 0: And that, Mr. Calvin Anderson, is really a big part of why we are so enthusiastic to be recommending landmark status this evening. So at a time that it was is a difficult place to be for a lot of folks in central Long Beach, especially youth.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Anderson was there for not only his family, but basically bringing in the entire community as a part of his family. And VIP records became really a refuge, not just somewhere to buy records and CDs, but somewhere where you could learn about music and the music industry.\nSpeaker 0: Somewhere where you had access to recording equipment, somewhere you could find someone to be your champion and to provide you some guidance. So when we look at historic landmarks, we look at different criteria under our ordinance. The first is that the sign is, in this case, associated with events that made a contribution to broad patterns of the\nSpeaker 0: city's history. So that's the development of rap and hip hop and a social movement that it recognizes. But I think the most important criteria that we're talking about tonight is criteria B, which is the association with lives of important persons and really recognizing the importance that Calvin held and holds to this day to the community.\nSpeaker 0: So this sign will be removed from its current location. So it can be properly restored, it will be stored, and then it will have a future life as part of a exhibition and asset to the community that I think you'll hear more about tonight.\nSpeaker 0: So with that, we are recommending that you declare the VIP record, sign a local city, historic landmark and direct staff to continue working with the VIP teams on preservation of the sign and promotion of it. So with that, if there's any questions for the staff table, I can answer them.\nSpeaker 0: And if not, we have a short video and I think we want to welcome Mr. Anderson first up to the microphone with his team. Great. So I know we do have a motion on the floor, but what we're going to do is Councilman Andrews has requested that we first do the public comment piece and Mr. Anderson wants\nSpeaker 0: to come first. So we'll do the video if there's any public comment, and then we'll go back to the council and we will hear from Mr. Andrews, the mic, the maker of the motion. Okay. So while folks come up, we do have a short video.\nSpeaker 0: So we're going to the video and then we're going to first hear from Mr. Anderson and the VIP team and then everyone else will get a chance to speak as well. Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 7: I became a rapper. The VIP was like the place to go. If you know what war. Wherever you wanted to showcase your skills for people who was in the music industry. And the VIP was the closest to the music industry.\nSpeaker 7: Considering that Campbell was dealing with all of the artists that was making records and putting out their music. So it was a direct connect. And once I started making music, I got a relationship with Campbell and so many employees at the VIP, and they allow me and my cousin Daz and Warren G and L.C. Slice.\nSpeaker 7: We were able to come up here and work and make some, you know, quality music that was like mixtape material. And eventually the music was, you know, strong enough to get us a record deal. So the VIP has been special to me in so many different ways.\nSpeaker 7: That's why I shot my first video here. When I put my record out, I made sure that VIP was the first place that you can get the album.\nSpeaker 0: Long Beach in the title, my third book. First of all.\nSpeaker 7: I wanted to shoot a video in the city that I was from because we had never had a video in Long Beach. Second of all, I wanted to come to a location that was monumental and a location that was really the centerpiece of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 7: So by choosing a VIP and having a director like Fab Five, Freddy and Dr. Dre, it it magnified the abilities of what we could do with the video. And it became a classic video, The Look of the shadow with the sound of it, the whole delivery of the video.\nSpeaker 7: And I'm just glad to be a part of it. I'm glad I can say that I brought that to the VIP for them doing what they did for me, that was like a payback, you know, for giving me the opportunity to hit home my skills and to become a rapper for me when I make it to come\nSpeaker 7: back and make VIP, the hottest spot in hip hop. And to this day, the VIP is known as one spot that artists from all over and people from all over just want to come and take pictures of for the simple fact that it's a love and a love they giving me is a love.\nSpeaker 7: But I took it outside of the city. I took a long beach with me. Everywhere I went, I took the VIP with me everywhere I went, because there's certain things that I was told that I loved on the east side that were instilled in me that I take with me everywhere I go.\nSpeaker 0: So we're going to hear from VIP first through Henderson. Thank you, Mayor Garcia and city council members. I stand before you today to tell you why I think that the VIP record affair should become a historical landmark. I have with me today VIP with opened June 1978, and it actually was opened by my brother Khalid, a fan\nSpeaker 0: of and is here with me today. Cletus opened the store. He redesigned the Christmas liquor store sign and turned it into a VIP record signing. So I am honored to have the man, not only the man who put me in the record business in 1972, of whom I worked for for seven years.\nSpeaker 0: And he taught me everything that I need to know about the business. And like I say, for those who have those extra questions about how did the saying come about, I actually had a living witness with me here today, so I'm happy about that.\nSpeaker 0: Also with me, I have my children with me, three of them, Tasha, Tanisha and my son Calvin Junior, who, you know, grew up in VIP. My daughter Latasha actually ran VIP for many years. That allowed me to go out and network and actually build the business and build the brand.\nSpeaker 0: I also have my brother, Timmy Danson here, who actually worked at VIP and one of the early pioneers in working with young males in the community to teach them how to become a deejay and, you know, were the big help.\nSpeaker 0: So my entire family, it was a big supporter of VIP records. I also have a few guys that worked for me back for many years. Keith Thompson, Deejay for Life. Michael White, Deejay Forsyth, now Deejay P and I also have first degree here that when I actually opened their recording studio in the back was very instrumental in\nSpeaker 0: working with those young men's and women's back during the time that I opened the recording studio back to the site. I have traveled all across the country and to a few places overseas. And what's remarkable about that sign is that I can just ask people, you know, I tell them I'm from Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Can you name anything, any sites or locations in Long Beach? And it's always the Queen Mary and VIP records. And I had a testimonial about six months ago from a young man that came in a store and bought a t shirt he sees going to Africa for a business trip for a week.\nSpeaker 0: And he said, Well, I can't tell you what I wore on Monday. He's about to see. I wore my VIP shirt and he said he was greeted warmly. Everybody was very inviting. He said, with the You wore something else and nobody saw him.\nSpeaker 0: So he wore his VIP shirt the rest of the time. Recently in May, I was on a cruise, Alaska cruise, and the day that I wore the VIP shirt and several people on the cruise from France, Germany, Japan, the South, Mississippi, Alabama and stuff.\nSpeaker 0: And it's just amazing the reaction that you get from people when they see this logo. There's a logo. And, you know, I am very proud of all of the years, six months from 40 years and six months, it'll be 40 years.\nSpeaker 0: The VIP records have stood on that corner. And, you know, I'm very happy about the work that we did for so many years in the community. You know, people always associate VIP records with rap and hip hop, but I am very proud of the gospel years, the jazz years, the blues years, the R&B years and the effect\nSpeaker 0: that we had on all of those artists for so many years. I also want to recognize. Chill, chill. The gentleman here, he's up there. I know you want to speak, so I hope we can get a mic up there to him.\nSpeaker 0: He's a little disabled and and have a little hard time getting around. But, man, I mean, we are part of the family and, you know, we treat everybody the same. And we have love, respect for the. I think that's one of the reason that I have been able to survive in this community is because we've been able\nSpeaker 0: to get back the love that we have shown in this community. And, you know, there's no millionaires in my family because we give everything away. And so, you know, we are we are that type of family. And, you know, my kids were pretty upset about it growing up, but I found out that they got the same problem\nSpeaker 0: . And so I've given, you know, everything away. So I hope today that you feel the importance of making this sign a historical landmark that I feel. And because in many people's heart it's already a historical landmark and stuff.\nSpeaker 0: So hopefully tonight we can make it official. I have received it with something and I'm almost stop. When I originally moved out of the original location, we had a lot of you know, it was on the news, it was on social media.\nSpeaker 0: And I had two people to come from Japan, one from France and one from Germany that said that they could not die before on foot in VIP records because it had that much influence and impact on their life.\nSpeaker 0: And so, you know, the sign is very important to a lot of people. You know, I was told that it's like 200 and something historical landmarks in Long Beach area, and I know that, but I don't know how many is known in this many places.\nSpeaker 0: This brand is known. So I hope that, like I say, everyone feels the same way I do in this past. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Lemmy, we're going to hear from the VP team first.\nSpeaker 0: So we're going to hear from the VIP folks who are here. Thank you. Good afternoon. To the mayor. The city of Long Beach and in Long Beach City Council. My name is Cletus Anderson. In 1967 Hours, an aircraft painter alone beat at Douglas Aircraft.\nSpeaker 0: Douglas Aircraft. I became the BRP painter of the Year in 1967. I also opened the first BRP. I named it the Pier, a very important place. KPFA Radio was the number one urban radio station at that time. They had a list called VIP Top 40.\nSpeaker 0: They always repeated BRP Top 40 number one records as being known as BRP. We reap the benefit sometime we could sell 100 copies of one single tile in a day. So BRP would hear we. We couldn't keep enough amateur in stock based on the fact they had that BRP survey sheet that they were mentioned.\nSpeaker 0: And we had that name. So I said, We'll go to the roof. And along came Snoop Dogg. And he'll leap up on the roof. The BRP and Long Beach. And he made a video. That video went worldwide. Things changed that BRP.\nSpeaker 0: BRP became the world famous BRP. And he stole my thunder. But when I travel the world, I ask people, Have they heard of BRP? And they will say yes. The world famous BRP landed Snoop Dogg. I see. You got it.\nSpeaker 0: So I visualize one day being at L.A.X. and.\nSpeaker 6: Seeing busses lined up world famous.\nSpeaker 0: BRP tours. Long Beach, California. That smells. That sales revenue. When I hear the word Long Beach, California, I think of Queen Mary. The Pike and the world famous VIP. Thank you for my time. Okay, I know we have some folks who want to speak, but is there anyone else from the VIP group that has a public comment\nSpeaker 0: at this time? Before we open it up to general public comment. Yes, please come forward.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8: Hi. I'm not going to keep long. First, I would like to say that I've been knowing I believe in Carnival for over 20 years, for sure. I know. And I can speak to his integrity, his character. I have never known him to be affiliated or looked at him as being a part of the rise of the gang\nSpeaker 8: movement in Long Beach. He is a very humble spirit. He's a very soft spoken individual. Is a man. Can I get a name in? I know somebody knows him. And so I did not identify with that being placed in your writing.\nSpeaker 8: I may maybe you have identified it, but I didn't when I thought about VIP records. And also Calvin, I don't know if somebody was killed in front of the building and that I really don't know you. But anyway, that just struck me.\nSpeaker 8: I'm very excited about this moment. I have to share with you that I spent the day with Snoop Dogg on last week, Tuesday, and even though he cannot be here, he is truly in spirit here with you all.\nSpeaker 8: He wants everybody to know he loves him some long beach. And just like he said, he attributes it to his success in many, many, many ways and looking forward to the day that that bonds can grow again. I'm grateful for the opportunity to stand here and just see this moment happen, period.\nSpeaker 8: And I would like to say that you all should address the possibility of a monument being set up with the signs somewhere in the city of Long Beach. I don't know if would be King Park, six district area.\nSpeaker 8: Somewhere on that side, there's a park right down the street, I believe, on Martin Luther King Boulevard that is right behind that, the high school there. And I think a monument of some sort to the legacy of this space and this sign would be a wonderful thing.\nSpeaker 8: I love you. You know I love you. Be bless.\nSpeaker 0: You. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Mayor Garcia City Council residents who are here tonight. I have been given a privilege to come up and speak by the VIP team who asked that I come and say a few words. My name is Katie Rispoli. Tommy.\nSpeaker 2: I'm the executive director of We Are Even a nonprofit based here in Long Beach. Our goal as an organization is to help young people understand the city that they live in and build a relationship with it. We were privileged to recognize Mr. Anderson for his many years of service to the community and for his work being a\nSpeaker 2: leader to youth in Long Beach over the last 40 years. Recently with our organization, I, as someone who holds a master's degree in historic preservation, recognize how valuable it is that we do this tonight. It's no secret that this country has carefully created a collection of historic sites that tell a specific version of our nation's history.\nSpeaker 2: And as a result, we've denied recognizing the full American story. Nationally, we have begun to broaden that conversation by even more. In the city of Long Beach. Right now, there are only two historic landmarks designated for their affiliation with a nonwhite non-male individual out of over 100.\nSpeaker 2: So it's time that we start to make this change. And tonight, I expect you'll move forward in designating number three. I hope you'll look around tonight and recognize the crowd that's in this room. I know, and I'm sure you know that people invest in the government that invests in them.\nSpeaker 2: Tonight you're investing in them. And as a result, this crowd is here. Some of them for the very first time. Don't let this be the last time we are in these chambers together. Tonight, designate VIP records a historic landmark and let this be the gateway to recognizing all history in Long Beach and acknowledging, respecting and celebrating our\nSpeaker 2: city's full population. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Excellent. Thank you so much. Best. Please come forward. And actually, we're going to lower that just for you just a little bit. Okay. I want to order for you there.\nSpeaker 3: So high tech.\nSpeaker 4: Technology. You got it. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And ladies and gentlemen of the council. My name is to me and I. I'm here to ask for your support to make the world famous VIP record sign a historical landmark for the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: I am eight years old, and in my short years, I have been able to see the impact that VIP records has had on the lives of many people. But I would like to speak on behalf of the children, children past and present, that have been able to see and use VIP as a safe haven, a support system\nSpeaker 1: , and a place to be encouraged. But to do their best, to be there best. For me, VIP represents family, and that sign that is recognized worldwide represents possibility to youth who hear the stories of how dreams were made possible in the doors of VIP, the place where creativity has been encouraged, where people are looked at for what\nSpeaker 1: they can be. This moment is important for my family, and I plan to make sure the legacy of VIP continues for generations to come. Thank you for allowing me to speak to you. And on and on. On a personal note to my papa, I am so happy to share this moment with you and other family members present\nSpeaker 1: . And it is amazing to hear how you have personally touched the lives of so many people in the city of Long Beach. We we, your family, are proud of you and love you. Thank you for your support.\nSpeaker 0: Very nice. Very nice. Thank you so much. And when we will move the speaker's platform up for the next speaker.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Vice Mayor. And ladies and gentlemen of the Council, I just am so overwhelmed with emotion today. I am grateful just to be able to experience this opportunity. I am here in support of you making the world famous VIP record sign a historical landmark here in the city of Long Beach, not just for\nSpeaker 3: its significance to hip hop, but to its significance to the community of Long Beach and to the people that I speak to personally, not in the community and worldwide. But see, that sign is home. See it as familiarity, see it as just a place to be, the place to be.\nSpeaker 3: When growing up, I grew up, as my father stated in V.I.P. All of us, my siblings and my cousins who are also here present. We are VIP kids because as you can see, and since 67, most of my cousins, most of us were born, all of us were born after 67, I think.\nSpeaker 3: And we have just been going through this process with my family. And it has been, like my father said, a amazing journey to experience the lives, being able to experience the lives of other people, letting us being able to be an impact to other people and going broke for other people.\nSpeaker 3: We do it not for accolades, but we do it for from the kindness of our heart. It is something that is embedded in us, all of us, as a family. And I'm just grateful again just to be able to have a father who has been instrumental in helping people achieve their dreams and instrumental in supporting people to\nSpeaker 3: be all that they can be. And again, I thank you. I am extremely humbled and thankful to be able to go through this experience. And I ask for you, encourage you to please make this a historical landmark. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next week at place. Hello. Love you guys. Appreciate the moment. My name is Freddie Johnson. I grew up in Long Beach. Okay. VIP has been open all my life and has been open to me and my friends all my life.\nSpeaker 0: And I've seen at least three of you guys on this panel at that place. You understand what I'm saying? There's only there's only really three things. In Long Beach, the Queen Mary also does pros, goes gay and is the VIP and is hip hop.\nSpeaker 0: Now, hip hop is something that is see or you got your own personal opinions about it. But one thing hip hop did do was make sure this city was well known. No matter what, Ali, or what corner you can go into.\nSpeaker 0: They know about Long Beach rehab. I've been everywhere around the world in this VIP shirt. And they respect it and they honor it. Because we upheld a love and understanding there of the city, of the culture of love in this city.\nSpeaker 0: And his brother behind me, Shani Domino. Okay. We took that place and we walked up to that place. No matter what we was going through or what we understood, we were accepted there and we were able to grow there and we learned things there that we couldn't learn at home.\nSpeaker 0: So it was a place for fatherless child to find a father. It was a place for a child can play safely in every way they can free think and they can learn. But what I'm asking guys is this What is history?\nSpeaker 0: A lot of you guys. A successful ministry. Look where you are. But that place is history to me because when people would not allow me. To express myself. That place did that, Mandy. When I needed some money to catch the bus to go try to to audition how many auditions we went to.\nSpeaker 0: So I had no money. But Calvin say he got $50 for you. Take this VIP shirt and you don't in number 60 and make sure you get out there and make it happen because we frontline is year. But what I'm asking you all to do is to give us something back.\nSpeaker 0: It might be small to you. It might not be too much importanti. But that sign means a whole lot to a whole lot of people. You know why? Because it was something to look up to. I go to Kings Park.\nSpeaker 0: I got the King statue, but I'd rather the man instead of a statue. But what we do have, I would rather have that and keep that because it is a part of my growing history. Every day I grew up on this side of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: That place was open to me and that place was there for me and my friends and I met my friends that could sing and rap because we are the original place of singing in rapid. Period. Long Beach is an R&B town.\nSpeaker 0: So what I'm asking you to do in your heart, what you know, what to do, because when you put this t shirt on. I know. Oh, yes. This is fly. Thank you very much. And there are available. But what I want to tell you is this.\nSpeaker 0: I want to smile with you. I want to laugh with you. But this place was a place that frowned with me to. So when I lost my father and when I lost my friends, that place gave me want.\nSpeaker 0: That place gave me a sanctuary. A place to go and learn how to pray. When the church wasn't open. Period. That's what I'm that's what I'm trying to get you all to understand the power and the value of this hip hop thing.\nSpeaker 0: Because the same people you look at, the Snoop Dogg's, the Domino's perfection, the twins, all of these guys excelled from the condition. They became celebrities from the same condition. That people make point at and say why? Well, here's why.\nSpeaker 0: Because it was a place to find change. So how many people will open the door to change instead of stand there and watch it die? I'm not pointing you out, but you'll know which ones I do know. And I don't know you.\nSpeaker 0: But I do know you because you run my community. You are responsible for the way that I grow here. So I'm asking you on behalf of hip hop, because this is my favorite hip hop. When I didn't have nowhere to go.\nSpeaker 0: When I was out trying to pull me to go to war, Calvin opened the door and gave me a cheer and let me plug that speaker up. And I stood and sat on the speaker until I figured out what I was going to do.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm asking you to please come sit on the speaker with me so he could give you an opportunity and show you a road to where we can go.\nSpeaker 6: Because as being.\nSpeaker 0: A young black man in Long Beach, I had many places to go. I have no where to go now. I have no place to go and celebrate my culture, which is hip hop. The hip hop and the culture that I'm talking about is not Hispanic, black, white, Jewish, Muslim.\nSpeaker 0: It is for people. And that's the problem that we have in this city, because I do understand, no matter what color you are, you are still people. And it takes people to put you where you at. So help these people keep the little bit we got out here so we can build some money.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker. So I, I obviously I obviously let the gentleman go beyond the time because I thought you had a lot to say. So I want to make sure you. Sure thing. But I want to make sure, obviously, just to to be you know, I've got to keep the rules going.\nSpeaker 0: So please, if can stay within the time allotted and we'll continue. Yes, sir. Hello. Thank you. City Council. When I was Vincent Martinez, I'm from Long Beach, California. I'm going to try to make a quick I'm actually on my lunch break, but I'm a music producer.\nSpeaker 0: I'm from the east side of Long Beach. I'm actually signed to a record label called Soul Election, which has has over a million followers worldwide. And a radio show on Beats one Apple Music. The reason I'm here is because I don't think any of that would have been possible without the app, because I had a lot of\nSpeaker 0: friends. I could have been a gang member. I could have done a lot of different things. But instead I just go to the skate park and I go to VIP records and learn about music, not just hip hop or jazz.\nSpeaker 0: So everything and none of that would have been possible without VIP. So I just want to say thank you, VIP. Thank you, guys, for your consideration for making this a landmark. And I hope you guys say yes and.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. This VIP record is, is honestly, I feel like I'm one of the youngest people speaking right now besides the Kilo girl that I feel that it's a it's a symbol of hope that you can make it out of here.\nSpeaker 0: So that's why I'm here. Just wanted to on behalf of the younger artists, because hip hop now is not just about gangster rap. There's a huge community of Long Beach. Of artists that are doing soul music, hip hop, just different things, speaking on a lot of issues in our community, and that's why I'm here, just to represent\nSpeaker 0: our younger community and let you guys know that I'm a product of what we did and that we can make it out of here and it's not. So that's kind of nervous. But yeah, I just want to say thank you, Gabby, and thank you guys.\nSpeaker 0: Doing great. Thank you very much. Mr. Pete, why don't you come up? But, yes, Mr. Pete, your next. Mr. Pete, I need you to. I need you to speak. Please. Hey, Mr. Pitt, you're up. Look.\nSpeaker 6: I.\nSpeaker 0: I know I've been waiting for you to come up. Go ahead, sir. Come on.\nSpeaker 6: Couple of seconds. Give an honor to Jesus. He's the only one who deserves honor to me. But anyway, at any rate, this is a great thing. You know, it's it's long overdue because I've been there been a landmark election, but I'm glad to see.\nSpeaker 6: And here today, you really honor something that black folks did because black folks put Long Beach on the map, as far as I'm concerned. So. I mean, that's that's real. I mean, I'm not coming off racist. I hear everybody that comes in here.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, they praise they praise their race. And it's good. Everybody's supposed to. If you're white, you're supposed to be glad for which are people dead. If you're Hispanic, be glad for what your people did. But, you know, it seems like when you say something about some black, oh, why don't you guys.\nSpeaker 6: You know, this is good. And we need to have more of this here. Unlike, you know, I've seen in the past, which given everybody else. So let's keep it American for Americans and let's let's do much more of this recognizing what's here and let's include real citizens and not non citizens, because I know this arc has a\nSpeaker 6: has a thing with non-citizens. And the bad thing to me about this is I've never this is beautiful seeing all these black folks out here. I wish we get them all the time.\nSpeaker 0: But with the.\nSpeaker 6: Way things are going with a rent control, you ain't gonna be here that long because rent control is about to drive them out. And that has something to do with this, too, because we're finally recognizing something that should have been recognized.\nSpeaker 6: But through, you know, all these other bills, I see non-English speakers being pushed. I want to see more things pushed for black folks. I know you don't like to look me in the eye, Mayor, but you sure do push Hispanic stuff because you're.\nSpeaker 0: Not wearing your Trump hat.\nSpeaker 6: That's why. Well, you know what? Doesn't matter. Oh, you trying to get funny, huh?\nSpeaker 0: Well, check this out. You usually you don't try to talk about time because, you know, nah.\nSpeaker 6: You don't try to make yourself.\nSpeaker 0: Seem like a good guy, because I don't think you're a good.\nSpeaker 6: Guy. And you guys better understand this guy is not for, you know, so so you come up here more often, we're going to get rid of that rent control because that's going to drive black folks out. We're going to do much more of this.\nSpeaker 6: Rent control is bad. I'm telling all you, black folks see what happened in Frisco, New York and Santa monica. There was blacks in Santa monica before they put back control. So they want to put rent control here. So I just had to say that.\nSpeaker 6: So you hear that? Remember, no rent control. They're trying to drive us out. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 6: Like.\nSpeaker 0: You go the next speaker. Okay. Hello. I'm the artist known as Domino, responsible for moving millions and millions of records, as well as being in many movies that have grossed quite a few millions of dollars. I just want to say that I have a lot of respect for VIP.\nSpeaker 0: When I was younger, they probably was the only corporation that was really identifying and connecting with the community, as far as I'm concerned. And, you know, a lot of us really we took this thing around the world because it meant a lot to us.\nSpeaker 0: It's responsible for many other artists that have moved many millions of records. I just don't know any other place or any other establishment in Long Beach that is responsible for such. And so I think that it is mandatory that we make something that has never been duplicated, a historical landmark.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm going to leave it at that, because everybody has already said what needs to be said. Sorry, that landmark in my head. So thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please compose.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening. My name is Pastor Q. I live here in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: It's interesting that VIP is on MLK and PCH. Dr. King said this Everybody can be great because anybody can serve.\nSpeaker 6: You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love. And when I think about VIP.\nSpeaker 0: I think about that.\nSpeaker 6: Soul right there generated by love. Why? Because in 1989, I walked into VIP, fresh from Texas with a group called The College Boys. And if you want to know who the college boys is, Ramani Malco, who starred in Think Like a Man.\nSpeaker 0: Two and Think Like a Man.\nSpeaker 6: And was in 40 year Old Virgin and starred in Weaves. So Kevin didn't just launch hip hop careers. He launched careers. Can I get a man up in here? And so to me, to me, I don't see you voting any other way.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, it's it's done. As far as I'm concerned. It's done. It should have been done. And Kevin, we went on. We walked in, like I said, in 89, we walked into VIP. One year later, we came to California to get a record deal.\nSpeaker 6: One year later, we had a record deal. Why did we have a record deal? He took money out of his own pocket, did a demo tape for us. We signed the Virgin record the next year. So. He has done so much for Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: It's time for Long Beach to do for VIP. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: This is so obvious. But thank you for hearing us out. My name is Cammy Johnson again. And I'm speaking. And I hopefully this is the last time I have to speak about the historical landmark designation. I really like to talk to the youth tonight and our future, because what we're doing today is for our future.\nSpeaker 3: We'll be here. Everyone who is standing here, there's going to be five and six year olds is going to look at this video tonight and they're going to say they fought for us. This historical landmark designation is just one step into a step that I hope that all of the council members, all of this city can stand\nSpeaker 3: behind because we have more to do. We have a museum to build. We have trucks to go out to share with the entire nation about black history and black music. We have so many things that needs to be done, and this is just one step to offer leverage into those things.\nSpeaker 3: VIP means more to me than anything, and here's why. When I first came to Long Beach, I was five years old. And the one thing that I knew when my dad used to take us over the VIP records to pick up his gospel albums, because that's all we could listen to.\nSpeaker 3: And then we also went to P&G to get Boudin and all of the Cajun food that we weren't able to get because he's from Louisiana. We were able to see black business at its heart and inspired me to not only be a hard worker, to get my education, to make sure that I don't only work for somebody\nSpeaker 3: , but I work for myself. This is what VIP did for me at five years old, and I continue every single day to work hard for this. This is not something that just came overnight. This is something that has been inbred in me the moment I stepped my foot onto that pavement.\nSpeaker 3: When I saw those record signs, I said I wanted to be a painter just like that. I wanted to do record covers just like that. And guess what? I became a graphic designer because of that. It took me ten years to get my bachelor's degree in graphic design.\nSpeaker 3: I worked hard. I was a single mom, and I was able to cross that line because I always had it in me to say that I am an example. And VIP was my example always. Thank you, Kelvin Anderson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you to Shirin. So the goal. You have you two have been really supportive of this movement and all I'm going to say one more time tonight to the youth. Hashtag support, V.I.P. Hashtag Dee Andrews Support VIP. Thanks so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, everyone. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name is Sol Anika Smith and I am a longtime resident of Long Beach and a volunteer in Long Beach. And many, many of our programs and this is obviously a no brainer, in my opinion and in the opinion of so many people here tonight.\nSpeaker 3: But Calvin, I am here also to let you guys know. Calvin is so much more than just a businessman who has had a business in Long Beach. He is a communitarian. The IP records and that sign is symbolic with what the city has been able to showcase, and that is diversity that is elevating the brand of the\nSpeaker 3: city of Long Beach to when people do recognize that sign. And it is very synonymous with progress, with dreams being realized and made. And it is because of Calvin's dedication and commitment to our community, whether it's volunteering for a King parade and having that his location as a stop point where we can rest, we can get T-shirts\nSpeaker 3: , we can get some some snacks, and we can keep going. It is a it's been an epicenter of dreams, of goals being realized and also where people can create and we can continue to do that. And I just encourage you guys to designate this as a Long Beach historical landmark for so many reasons and to also so\nSpeaker 3: thank you to Calvin for being not only a wonderful person and businessman, but but communitarian in our community. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Speaker, please. Thank you, mayor. City councilman. I'm the youngest brother and he's the oldest. And via AP Records has been my life and the lives of most of the kids. We had over like 14 stores, so every kid and everybody that worked inside his store.\nSpeaker 0: Soon as he got out of school, I was brought to Bishop Long Beach a few months before Calvin took over the store. And it was a beautiful store back then and was still a beautiful store when he took over and ran the store.\nSpeaker 0: I think that everybody has a lot of things to say about the VIP. So in the past, I have vision for the future for VIP. I've been pushing also the museum idea. I see that New York is putting $40 million into hip hop music museum in New York.\nSpeaker 0: I say Long Beach is a place for right here. I hear earlier we are short money, short million dollars of all the programs. Then money need to come to Long Beach. I believe that VIP can bring that money.\nSpeaker 0: I look at things like the voice now that everybody's watching on television. VIP was a voice you want the VIP kids came there and we tell you, you have a hit record. You don't have one good many record companies.\nSpeaker 0: Often, every Thursday, actually, they invited us to the record company to pick out the next hit. The artist didn't pick the hit. We picked the hit. We told Best Buy what was hot. We told Target what was hot.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, we didn't get the credit for it. But VIP records was a foundation for hip hop and R&B and jazz and gospel and blues. So I think that talking about the past and I think you've already made your minds up about the historical and that's good.\nSpeaker 0: But I also believe that VIP can be the next Queen Mary for you. So I want to pass it on, but I thank you guys for my time. Thank you. Next week, a Bruce Springsteen. Good evening, Mayor and Council.\nSpeaker 0: My name is Bruce Milam, Jr. I moved to Long Beach, 1992 from Joliet, Illinois, and I wanted to come too. I moved out of there to get away from the violence and to come.\nSpeaker 8: To Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: And then I got here with the naval shipyard. My brother was in the Navy and I you know, I missed the Navy here and I moved here and want to be in this being the entertainment business. And so my first very my first celebrity I even seen was that VIP wreckers, that Snoop Dogg video Shoot You Can\nSpeaker 0: is a little speck or you can see.\nSpeaker 8: Me in the video.\nSpeaker 0: It was a lot of people there, but but Fab Five, Freddy, Dr. Dre, it was really exciting to me to let me know that seen him there in the city, that I can do it too. And so from there, you know, I end up appearing on Emmy Awards and I released the album called Through the Eyes of\nSpeaker 0: the Real. In my first album, The Wrestler, we had friends, they call it VIP Records and Killed to let us put our album in the store. So from the video shoot, you know, years later, record music took in a record deal and ended up having our CD in his store.\nSpeaker 0: So I appreciate that. And, you know, now have a show called Downtown Bruce and and I'm on Franklin Middle School. Wilson Long Beach City College.\nSpeaker 3: Entrepreneur Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: What aromatherapy business? I love Long Beach and with VIP records, it really helped me, you know, have, you know, take my dreams to the next level with knowing that I can do it. Seen all the celebrities being in the mix, as we call it.\nSpeaker 0: And so I would really recommend that you guys make this landmark happen. So, Kevin, I want to thank you for, you know, everybody in Long Beach for, you know, taking it to the next level. We appreciate that. And so this bill is real business.\nSpeaker 0: We have a lot of friends is a number of it's a lot of people that's not even here that went to VIP records and became so-called celebrities or got record deals. It's a number of them, the big list.\nSpeaker 0: So this is real. We want to thank you and I appreciate it. Once again, I'm Bruce Mahlum and I see you guys later. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good afternoon, Mayor. Good afternoon, counsel.\nSpeaker 0: And more importantly, good afternoon, Long Beach or good evening. Now my name is On the Fire, which I've been living in Long Beach for over a decade. And I'd like to first of say that VP Records is Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: And, you know, I came to Long Beach in eighth grade coming from Orange County and, you know, coming into Long Beach. And I went to Will Rogers Middle School and I met a buddy of mine named Matthew Roe, who who came out to me.\nSpeaker 0: And I was a big dude. I was about \u00a3300 at the time. And he said, Damn you a big guy, man. Where are you going? High school. And I said, You know, I'm going to I'm going to Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Wilson And he said, All Hell no, hell no. You're going to you're coming to the phone calls. You come to Long Beach Poly and you go play football with us. So, you know, after that, I went up to my mom and dad and I said, mom and dad, you know, I'm not going to school unless you want\nSpeaker 0: me a Long Beach poly. And, you know, I went in there and I got I went in there. I was coached by Coach Slice right there. And, you know, I really embraced what, you know, the community of Long Beach was all about.\nSpeaker 0: I really embraced, you know, what that meant. And, you know, here I am, you know, a white boy from Orange County. And I'm surrounded by, you know, you know, blacks, Pacific Islanders. And, you know, I was kind of but but, you know, playing a sport and what's one thing that we we all related to was music.\nSpeaker 0: And I knew of coming along because I knew, you know, three things. I knew my parents had business in Long Beach. I knew the Long Beach Grand Prix because I love races and I know Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg and VIP records.\nSpeaker 0: And, you know, music brings community together. And when you look at, you know, what Snoop Dogg has done for for music, for hip hop and for, you know, just bringing cultures together and bringing community together, I think, reflects on what, you know, Kelvin and his family started here at VIP.\nSpeaker 0: And, you know, just bringing in community, bringing in, you know, things for good, you know, creating art. And I think that's that's truly is a you know, I think it's truly is a blessing that, you know, God has given us.\nSpeaker 0: Calvin and his family brought him to Long Beach. And, you know, you see the product of, you know, what has been created because of that. And, you know. I just I just want to say, you know, I, I worked with I got the real estate license I work with.\nSpeaker 0: My mom was a broker here in Long Beach. And, you know, we we were living in a property on Long Beach Boulevard. And my mom's like, here, you got to open up this property. We got some, you know, clients coming in.\nSpeaker 0: And, you know, we go in there, I open up the property and here comes, you know, Sharon and Kelvin. They come in and they're like, hey, you know, we're from VPI Records. I was like, Get out of here.\nSpeaker 0: I'm talking VP Records right now. It's just I, I couldn't believe it. And, you know, it's just. Just the warm hearted greeting I got from them and just just you. You could feel when you're around good people. And it was just I just can't say, you know, much more about, you know what, you know what Kelvin is\nSpeaker 0: and the VP records and that whole family is just they're truly are, you know, great people and you know, this deserves and I'm surprised it's not a landmark. You know, over 40 years everybody knows that sign from every every country in the world.\nSpeaker 0: You got to keep the time, so just keep it. Yeah, no worries. Always. I thank you for your time. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Next speaker, please. Good evening, council members and mayor. My name is Daryl Mosley and I'm here on behalf of Kelvin Anderson and the world famous VIP.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm praying that you guys support and vote to make it a historic historical landmark. My story is basically I grew up in Long Beach since I was eight, and I went to I graduated from Poly High and I lived in Signal Hill and I had to come down Martin Luther King to go to Poly High.\nSpeaker 0: I fell in love with music at a young age. And instead of hanging out and, you know, doing different things, I chose to follow music. And VIP was the place where I could do that, you know what I mean?\nSpeaker 0: And they welcomed me back in the day. We had like Warehouse in Lakewood and Tower Records and all that, and I couldn't hang out there for obvious reasons, but I could hang out at VIP though, and they would welcome me like a family member and made me feel welcome.\nSpeaker 0: And I thank you for that. Calvin. I feel this should be a historical landmark because of its significance to the world and what it does for Long Beach. I also worked at VIP for many years and I've seen a lot of people come from different countries and it's just amazing how respected, you know, that sign is in\nSpeaker 0: that record stories. You know, it kind of blew my mind to see people from Japan, from Australia, from all over the world, you know, I mean, they really recognized this sign. And like a lot of these brothers behind me, you know, I mean, my dream was to be a producer, a rapper.\nSpeaker 0: And he helped me, you know, have the ability to honed his skills. And I thank him for that. And there's a lot of people, I'm pretty sure that have that same feeling, you know what I mean? So I pray that you guys do the right thing and vote to possibly make it or not possibly, but make it\nSpeaker 0: a historical landmark because it's the right thing to do. And I thank you for your time. Thank you. We have three final speakers. I'm closing the speakers list so that. Oh, I'm sorry. So we have a clip, a few more.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I just wanna make sure I know how many have have. I can close the speakers list. I have the four that are in line and I have the gentleman that's in the back actually. Okay, it's going to be five in line.\nSpeaker 0: The gentleman, the back and then the speakers list is closed. Okay. It is now closed. I'm going to let the gentleman in the back go and then I'm going to have you come up next search. So please, sir.\nSpeaker 0: Hi.\nSpeaker 8: Hello. My name is Marcus Phillips.\nSpeaker 0: Better known as Chill. Singer, songwriter, producer out of.\nSpeaker 8: The Abbey Records.\nSpeaker 0: According to the AP, more than, well, probably 24 years ago as a member of the group 12 M, which was managed by Calvin and. I've seen personally being there VIP people that come in here and just from from all over the world.\nSpeaker 8: And just get so fascinated and just.\nSpeaker 0: So starstruck being there and may not even be a started to looking at but if you do you know, they look at you as being kind of a star at VIP. We see a lot about VIP records, the sign itself, because it is very important to the community.\nSpeaker 0: But Kelvin Anderson is very important to the community called The Good. Children did a lot for.\nSpeaker 8: The community and is still doing a lot for the community.\nSpeaker 0: If you need a job, he would give you a job even if even a just work day to sweep up or something. But he was always giving back. And this was not just to people in in Long Beach, but it really didn't matter where you came from.\nSpeaker 0: Anybody can come to Calvin and Calvin would help you with anything. I was always able to able to go to Calvin about anything, and he was always willing to help. When I was made up in that organization was the worst experience in my life.\nSpeaker 0: No, tell me 1/2. I think to make just one out that can. Yeah. There you go. You know, when I was up in the hospital after open heart surgery and I woke up and saw Calvin sitting there. And many.\nSpeaker 8: Times in that hospital.\nSpeaker 0: Campbell was there. Yeah. P t shirts and, you know, hats, whatever. I was at the Heritage Commission last month. Days after that, I had another heart attack. So I didn't know if I was going to be able to be here today.\nSpeaker 0: But I will call Calhoun once in a while and say, Hey, what's going on? And I plan on being there. So I'm I'm thankful to even be here today. God has blessed me to even. Just in case. There we go.\nSpeaker 0: Yep. So your guys blessed me to even see this day, but I'm more thankful to see all the people that have come out to support VIP. And there are many more that should have been here and probably could have been here.\nSpeaker 0: But they aren't for whatever reason. But.\nSpeaker 8: To me, I'm saying that this is going to be designated a landmark. And I wish we could designate a man as landmark.\nSpeaker 0: As Calvin would definitely.\nSpeaker 8: Get that. And I'm just pretty out there.\nSpeaker 0: Maybe kill Musharraf or cancel, you know? Thank you, sir. Bishop, in the last four speakers here. Yes, sir. All right. Hello, Mayor. And the rest of the council members. My name is Kelvin Anderson, Junior. I am the son of this man here.\nSpeaker 0: I've known him all my life. Uh, I'd like to pretty much make my long story short. It's pretty much as everybody has said, that, um, as far as what my father and what my uncles have done is they took a city and truthfully made a family out of it.\nSpeaker 0: I really don't see the record shop as a record shop. I literally see it as my home. And everybody that comes in is whether a brother or sister or uncle. And I refer to these people as such. I don't even refer to them as clients.\nSpeaker 0: So even with that being said to where I can see a man who sees a young man stealing from him and he disciplines him by taking his bike. And then the same very young man that came home, his skills to where he becomes a superstar today, that speaks volumes to where somebody just got out of jail for\nSpeaker 0: whatever they may have done, still brought him to the back, led him home, his due skills, and he became a legend today, honestly, one of the biggest stars known today. How would that have happened? I mean, to give them a chance.\nSpeaker 0: You ask yourself that. This man who everybody else kicked to the curb, he brought inside. Every last one of them, no matter how reckless they may have gotten. He saw the content of their character as far as what was underneath, as far as well as hidden behind any problem that they had.\nSpeaker 0: He was there for them. So with that being said, with what my father has done and what my uncle has done and how this may be a legacy and all that. Yes, that is true. And I'm only speaking on behalf of friends that I have in Japan that I would have never met in my life.\nSpeaker 0: Switzerland, Netherlands. Uganda. Who thinks to go there? To be honest. So with him having this entity and for people to treat this place like it's their own backyard, as if they've went to Michael Jordan's house or they went to Michael Jackson's house or anything like that.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm looking at this place like an everyday place, but they treat this place as if it is a church. If if everybody understands what I'm saying to them is sanctified to them, it's holy to them. It was their place of safety.\nSpeaker 0: They couldn't go home and do none of this. As a couple of others have said, my father became their father. That's why I look at them as my brothers or my peers. A lot of these people, I've cried with them, laugh with them.\nSpeaker 0: So this place is more than a business. So for this place to not already be an official legacy. I find that a problem. So for it to have took this long. Don't get me wrong, I'm very appreciative. But this should have been something that happened a long time ago.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Next speaker. Very good. You. I, too, was at that Heritage Commission and I hadn't heard I obviously had heard about the IP records, but had never heard the full saga.\nSpeaker 0: And it was extraordinarily impressive. You've heard it here today. My range of of African-American singers, artists is rather limited. Fats Domino was mine in terms of anything that it approached that in the other end of the scale. Marian Anderson, who I still think we should honor by having a facility down here.\nSpeaker 0: I would get into that at some other time. Well, and it was just so impressed by the the how culturally important it was to the people in the and within the black community and so forth. Functioning as a why?\nSpeaker 0: A sports operation or a parody organization. Well, one of the things I related to when somebody mentioned taking the 60 bus up to Hollywood reminds me a long time ago and in high school I had a boy band and in the summers we had a good summer in Maine.\nSpeaker 0: The neighbor, one of our neighbors, was a vice president of Capitol Records. So when I came out here, I did take the 60 bus and I forget what a bus is for the blue eye. What bus? Up to Capitol Records.\nSpeaker 0: And I went in, auditioned for it. He said, Come on back. I want you to meet somebody. Came back the next day and auditioned with him and Lew Wasserman. You know, it was crazy watching this one. They heard me sing.\nSpeaker 0: They sang me to a contract, the likes of which all they want is a lifetime contract. And the only other life going contract, which was a steel berg, had that lifetime contract as long as I was, as long as I promised never, ever, ever to sing.\nSpeaker 0: Because I figured if I sang, it would ruin the industry. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 9: I think it.\nSpeaker 0: Was actually wonderful. Oh, no, I'm with that one. Wow. Yes, sir. A mayor, a city councilman. I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight, showing their support. I have no big, huge story. But I do want to say VIP has been a very, very, very special part of the community, of the city, of the history of\nSpeaker 0: not only Long Beach, but of California as well. It's a unique landmark. It's one of a kind. And I think we all know if we would do what's in our hearts to make it a historic landmark for the world, not just for the city, but for the whole world.\nSpeaker 0: And like we said, for the youth and an up and coming generation. I would like to give my votes for because without the VIP, I would have missed a lot of opportunities as well. You know, so we all have personal stories that we can tie to the VIP and.\nSpeaker 0: I just want to give my thanks for the brother, for standing there for so long through the ups and downs and not giving up and not giving given out and not turning his back on the community and for always helping and accepting us.\nSpeaker 0: And so with that, I truly thank you. And for those who don't have anything to give for Christmas, please come down to the shop. We got great items. We got good clothes, all sizes. Come get them for the Lord.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Councilman D'Angelo and the council. I just want to commend you guys for listening to the sixth District for PAP record. I commend you for that. I didn't see too many people on a cell phone in the council meeting as we were speaking, but I think\nSpeaker 0: you guys were hearing out VIP records. And I'm looking for for Councilman De Andrew and the mayor of Lowndes to continue to make this process, be a process and find a home for the sign of VIP records. I spoke with De Andrew earlier and he has our support to help VIP find a place for the amendment.\nSpeaker 0: And Councilman Garcia, I heard that you have been a very supportive in this and we as the sixth District will look forward to complete this process. And I thank you guys for hearing out all the different views that we had because we are different culture and people have different thoughts, but we all are one people and tell\nSpeaker 0: the innocent how, bring us all together. And I just want to thank the councilmen and the mayor and the Andrew for your support. And we're looking forward for your continued support. And by the way, I'm sorry, my name is Michael Baker.\nSpeaker 0: I own a barbershop next to Kelly Anderson. Mr. Baker Southcenter mayor, we met before. I don't know if you remember, but we really appreciate all the things that you have done for Sixth District. And may God continue to bless all of us.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. You know, the last bit askew. The mayor. I'm sorry. Have you got one quick thing that I want to say before Sherry speak, and that is the ACMA. 2015, I placed a sign up on eBay.\nSpeaker 0: I was burnt out. I was tired. I was alone. I'm like, you know, I can't go any further and stuff. So I actually took a stand off of eBay to look at some other possibilities and stuff, so I buy me a year.\nSpeaker 0: The idea of open a black music museum came to mind. So I'm like, okay, well, I need to sell design if I'm gonna try to open a museum. So near the end of the year, I'm like, Man, how do I get this done?\nSpeaker 0: Because in order for me to get this done, I need a relationship with the city of Long Beach. And he needed things, did you know, to help make this happen? Well, I would say around October, a friend of mine came back into my life that I hadn't seen in like 20 some years.\nSpeaker 0: And she said that she had been thinking about me. She'd been kind of reading things that was going on with me. So she came back and I sit down and I presented to her what I was trying to do or would like to do.\nSpeaker 0: And she said, Those things can happen. And I'm saying this, sorry, I love you. You really took this dream. And it's almost to make it a reality. I mean, I never couldn't have gotten this far without you. You're hard work, man.\nSpeaker 0: I don't know what else to say, but I had to get up here on record to make sure that I left. Not only. You guys, but everyone in here know how hard she have worked to make this dream a reality.\nSpeaker 0: So I had to say that.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. I feel like I know you guys. I really do feel like your family. Even though we bump heads, we disagree on some things. Equity. It's important. And I don't want to talk about the past. I'm not here to convince you to make it a historic landmark.\nSpeaker 3: It's an important resource. And I know you're going to do the right thing. But what we want is for this moment not to be symbolic. We want this moment to be utilized to rebuild our communities. We want jobs.\nSpeaker 3: We want to bridge the gap in technology. We want to deal with mental health issues in our communities. We want to bring creativity in our communities. And we want to make sure that when there's a place down the street that's only a mile away, where there's only 3% poverty in kids and there's millions of dollars spent.\nSpeaker 3: We want our communities where there's 50% poverty in the sixth District among youth to be invested in the same way in historic landmark. I've had so many comments online. Why would the mayor throw away $80,000? Why would the city council do that?\nSpeaker 3: Help a private business? You didn't. You secured a historic landmark for the city of Long Beach that will bring your property values up in the area that it's in, 15 to 20%. You're securing a historic landmark that's going to bring millions of dollars in tourism into the city.\nSpeaker 3: And we're not looking for handouts, but we're looking for partnerships. And we're looking for the city to invest in what Calvin Anderson and Cletus Anderson laid down for us as a foundation. It's one that works. And so when we sit down and we meet and like, God bless you, vice Mayor, for the work you're doing with youth\nSpeaker 3: , because you have been showing up for everything we ask you for. Councilman Pierce, you are an amazing supporter. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, Councilman Austin. You've been wonderful since we've opened up the small space in your community and you're very supportive.\nSpeaker 3: And and Mayor, you know, we have a we have something special. But I want us not to focus on. This the missteps of the past and limit our relationship for the future. It's really important for this sign not to be anchored as a monument thrown up somewhere that that's not what's going to happen.\nSpeaker 3: Guys, we have put together a plan to the city. We have put together a plan. And we have our eye on where that science should go. And that's on MLK and Pacific on that empty property where history was built.\nSpeaker 3: We should not have to bid. Right now, we're in a bidding process on this property. And I encourage the city attorney Pat or city manager Pat West and the city attorneys and the city council to work together to find how we can legally build our museum and multimedia center on that land.\nSpeaker 3: We should not have to run the race with everyone else. We should not have to be competing with developers outside of our city. When this man built that corner, it's not going to happen. But what I can tell you is that we're committed to help you raise the money, bring in the celebrity, bring in the investments, and\nSpeaker 3: rebuild the sixth District to reflect African American history where people can thrive again. This is it's not a sign. It's hope. It anchored hope when children had nowhere to go. It anchored hope. And that hope is not gone.\nSpeaker 3: And so what's really important, many have asked us. Right, Pops? How come you guys don't just take the sign and go downtown and open up a cool place and it's fun and you've got performances and music and all that is still.\nSpeaker 3: You're making it too complicated, they tell us. But if we abandon the community that built us. That's not what should happen. And so today is a beautiful day. But it's a bittersweet moment because 711 and the same week as this becomes a historic landmark, will be moving into the origin or opening up their celebration party this week\nSpeaker 3: to a Japanese corporation and a 40 year old African American historic spot. When this sign finds a home, it will become a point of interest. It's really important for us council members to understand the value that brings to the city.\nSpeaker 3: It would be the only one of its kind west of Mississippi. It would put it on the global maps and it will bring in investments and funds. We just want you to work with us the way you work with other communities.\nSpeaker 3: And so that Domino and all of the other artists and all of that can come back and invest their time in the facilities we build, in the multimedia centers we build. And so we want to thank you, and I really do appreciate you.\nSpeaker 3: But I'm an advocate and advocates are like doctors. You don't ever go to them when you're feeling well. Right. And so it gets a little bit uncomfortable sometimes when someone's fighting for equity, it gets a little bit uncomfortable.\nSpeaker 3: But we're here to work with you. Hand in glove equity has to be a plan and not something we fight for on a day to day basis. And so that's why it's important that the economic blueprints that we create of equality somehow have to work with the land use plan that has no equality, no equity clauses in\nSpeaker 3: it. We have to be smart in our planning right now, guys, before we get to 2040. I love our development and our growth, but if we have an amazing blueprint that says inclusion and then we have a plan that builds, that does not create a part for inclusion, we're going to continue to battle each other, and that's\nSpeaker 3: not where we want to be. So I appreciate you. I really thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I hope that we can create spaces in all your districts. Really, the opportunities that have been coming in are amazing.\nSpeaker 3: But I just ask you that when you look at VIP records, you look at something that is a benefit to the community, our resources, our growth, our kids and to help us invest. So I appreciate you. Thank you for honoring Pops, Calvin and Clearest Anderson and the Anderson family.\nSpeaker 3: And I hope we can continue to build from here. So thank you, Mayor. And to people, honestly, that have stuck with me, Chrysler, Batman has honestly held me through some really tough times. We have an incredible head of our economic development department, guys, that really believes in inclusion.\nSpeaker 3: He puts his money where his mouth is, his work, where his mouth is, and it makes us feel hopeful and a mark. Taylor, thank you so much. And Christopher Coons, thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you. So appreciate that. That concludes public comment. We're going to go now back to the council. There is in motion in a second on the floor to move forward with the designation. Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Thank you, ma'am. First of all, before I get started here, you know that it seems like we we shouldn't even be talking about the VIP side. We should be talking about Kevin, because this young man here, his compassion and sympathy, what he's done for the sixth District and for the VIP.\nSpeaker 0: You guys here, I've been here, I think, longer than most of the individuals, 70 some years. And I've blacks have come and go. But I think Kevin's about the only black business that we still almost have opening now.\nSpeaker 0: There's a lot of things I think we can do. I think one of the biggest mistakes we made there is we didn't buy the building. We tried trying to deal with a lot. And I hear the young lady talk about across the street, you have to deal with that.\nSpeaker 0: I understand that. But there was a building already there. Kevin started there, and that's where Kevin should be. So there's some things that we should take under consideration. When I gave my $80,000, it wasn't because of the fact that I felt like I was just giving money away.\nSpeaker 0: I knew what it was for. And I hope that some of my other constituents up here will be saying great things about VIP. But sometimes I want you to put your money where your mouth is. So when we finish all of this, I'm hoping that Mr. Kevin and his family and the people here in the city of\nSpeaker 0: Long Beach. First time ever since I've been here for 11 years and that this many African-Americans come out and speak on any issue. So this kind of tells me something. When you get riled up about something, you will come out and you will speak about it.\nSpeaker 0: You will talk about it. And some of the speakers I heard tonight, if I had and that I would give all my money to you, Kevin, because when they finish, but it's just the idea that we have something that should be a historical monument.\nSpeaker 0: It shouldn't. That should be a no brainer. But then the thing about it, where are we going to put it? Put it where it started. I mean, these are some things that we really should take into consideration. And I want to thank everybody who came out tonight and showed their compassion and consideration, especially for a young man\nSpeaker 0: who started it. And Kevin, I don't think you want to leave it to him with it just up in the air somewhere. We don't put it off in a corner. It has to be more than that. And I'm praying that we can get behind that and raise enough money where we can, you know, really show the honor\nSpeaker 0: and privilege that this young that this sign means to all of us. And I'm sure Snoop right now is looking and doing his little rap song about it. We're going to get some of his money, too, but we've got to get this thing right.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much, everyone. Yes. Thank you, Councilman. Next up is Councilman Austin to be the second.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And I appreciate those comments.\nSpeaker 6: Councilman Andrews, I want to thank Mr. Anderson for being a real pillar in our community. A father figure, a mentor, a black business leader, and inspiring so many in this great city and beyond. You are a real example of being your brother's keeper.\nSpeaker 6: And so we appreciate you very, very much. Thank you. And to the community. To all of the speakers. I don't think a whole lot needs to even be said behind Israel because you guys said it all. I appreciate and I share your passion for this design.\nSpeaker 6: This is an easy call for me as a council member. Who am I? What's my name? That video put Long Beach on the map in the hip hop genre, which is now international. It's a classic that made me snoop in VIP in Epic, Epic and worldwide.\nSpeaker 6: VIP serves as a community art space for so many youth over the years, and they work on there as they worked on their craft. And our city would be better off, I think, if we had more VIP records across the city.\nSpeaker 6: I would I would welcome one in my community. I was a young 20 something year old aircraft worker, Long Beach City College student, when I moved here to Long Beach. Many of my coworkers had roots in the east side of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: This east side of Long Beach. Not that. No, no. To my council members, I used to get I used to get all of my new releases, their mixtapes, VIP records. Usually after getting a fresh cut from Bobby Neill's, which preceded Mr. Baker will go to PPG Fish Market.\nSpeaker 6: Get my buying pies from Marcus. Yeah. Oh, and we ran many, many campaigns out of that shopping center. And Calvin was was part of many of the VIP, was always the anchor space in that shopping center. I think the sign is perfectly good where it's at right now.\nSpeaker 6: I always felt at home in every part of the city, but the sixth district is always going to have a special place in my heart. My wife, Daysha, who's upstairs? Hello. Jason and I and our sons have made many great memories in their community there.\nSpeaker 6: We continue to do so as Polly family as well as long as patriotism and our involvement in that. Tonight, we are here to honor and we honor you. Calvin Anderson is an entrepreneur and creating an era of pride for our city through your business efforts.\nSpeaker 6: This VIP record sign has been it is an iconic centerpoint in our community, and I'm heartened to know that tonight will be making it a historic landmark. I'll be strongly supporting the recommendation of the Cultural Heritage Committee Commission and voting in the affirmative.\nSpeaker 6: But also, you have my commitment to to work with you moving forward to make sure that we preserve the history that we built. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much, Councilman. Vice Mayor Richardson, thank you so quickly. I just wanted to chime in and just say that, frankly, I'm just honored to be a part of the city council that gets to take this vote tonight and really reflect and represent what you are the community of articulate so well tonight.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm really honored to take that step. I do want to acknowledge that you've done a great job. So so Calvin Shaw ran the whole team, the community in articulating your stories. And that's what's required to make sure, like our shirts as equity, to make sure that we can make a case for why our communities are diverse\nSpeaker 0: , culturally diverse communities matter. I was astounded. You know, I mean, this this conversation has really elevated the broader conversation in our city around sort of the relevancy of our culture, heritage process and and whether or not we as a city of our historical landmarks, if if our cultural representation is really reflective of the diversity we're really proud\nSpeaker 0: of. And so you have really elevated that issue. You've done your part. Now it's on US policymakers to make sure we address the system that was put in place for why we have that lack of diversity. So it doesn't stop with this landmark process tonight.\nSpeaker 0: We have to make sure that we continue to acknowledge and demand that all communities, no matter your background, you have a significant history that's relevant and it's important and it needs to be recognized by our city. Finally, I just want to give a big shout out to the Andrew's the.\nSpeaker 0: I got to tell you, when sometimes it's difficult to articulate something that's important to you in your community, to others, and you've stepped up, put together the funding to make all of this possible. And so I do want to recognize you for doing that and say that I support I support your leadership.\nSpeaker 0: I support the community. I'm going to vote in support of this tonight. And I want to see. I want to see where this all lands. I want to make sure that we do keep the presence of Bishop Long Beach in central Long Beach, where it where it started.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor Council Member Pearce.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I am also extremely honored to be on the council that gets to name this as a historical landmark. The first time this came to council, I shared a lot about my background and some of you guys probably heard I won't share it all again today.\nSpeaker 2: But you know, when Snoop said, I take Long Beach or I took Long Beach everywhere I went. Growing up in Houston, in the neighborhood I grew up in, hip hop and rap was a core part of of me.\nSpeaker 2: Even though the majority of the folks didn't look like me, I still grew up poor and grew up where those stories were relevant for me. And so coming along, this was the first place I drove by. The very first time we moved to California and we took our drive up PCH.\nSpeaker 2: We said, we got to stop and see. And I you know, Sharon has been an amazing advocate. And I think the comments that she makes, it gets uncomfortable when people fight for equity is so core to where we are on this council, to where we are in history right now, and how proud I am of you all\nSpeaker 2: fighting and demanding that equity and working with councilmembers like Councilmember de Andrews, who has always fought for equity. And sometimes we need community members as a partner to work with to be able to get there while we have a vision in our heart and we know where we want to go.\nSpeaker 2: We can't do it alone unless you guys are out there fighting with us. And you were here tonight. And so and I'm saying I agree this comment, this is the beginning of where we're going. This is the beginning of a partnership with the rest of the colleagues, with the mayor.\nSpeaker 2: And again, I do want to shout out to John, our economic development director. I've worked on him on a couple of items around equity and just he's always so great about having that conversation define what that word means for me.\nSpeaker 2: What does that look like? And process. We're growing as a city and we're growing as a city because you guys put your hearts out there and every single one of you, Calvin, you obviously are a mentor so much.\nSpeaker 2: And as my colleague said, My Brother's Keeper and I think about that lately I've been doing this thing where I'm like, how do I get my good karma, right? So it's like I'm paying other people's meters and everything and it's just having that warmth that you guys have.\nSpeaker 2: You feel like a family and you bring that in here and it feels so warm and so loving. And I just want to thank you for sharing your stories with us. I look forward to working together. I know you guys have your heart set on a place and whatever we can do, we will do that.\nSpeaker 2: And I've also talked about how do we go and bring other folks to this partnership? While you guys have put Long Beach on the map for music, we also have another other communities that have music. And so how do we do this together will be, say, all of us can celebrate our diversity and Long Beach together.\nSpeaker 2: You know, you've got indie artists that love hip hop and vice versa. We all take from everybody's art and craft. And so I'm really looking forward to what this means for the next steps for Long Beach. We'll just thank you all for putting yourself out there.\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I, too, want to say I hope everyone will support and I think we're getting there. Absolutely. And I want to say congratulations for all of the work that each of you have done, Calvin, Cletus, your whole family.\nSpeaker 2: Shereen Your words were just absolutely beautiful for a councilmember like myself who grew up in my younger years in North Long Beach and then going to Cal State and then becoming a council member. And I think when I was very first elected, I went into the store and talked to Calvin and just learned the history because that\nSpeaker 2: was the first thing is like when you become elected, you have to understand not what's going to be happening next, but where we've come from and what the history is. And I was so glad to have that chance to speak with you directly and just have a moment with you about a couple of t shirts about my\nSpeaker 2: records I had my first record player had to get them at VIP, but just like my council colleagues had mentioned, this is just the beginning. I know that the landmark is one thing, but the beginning means that I see you becoming really a fixture of mentor mentorship with a lot of entrepreneurs that are coming along that really\nSpeaker 2: want to know the history, not people that, you know, come in here and kind of fly by night and just go in and go out. But people that have been here and a mainstay for social responsibility and great entrepreneurship.\nSpeaker 2: So I absolutely see that for you. And I just want to say again, thank you. You have sold our city. A lot of times we go to other regions and we talk about the city of Long Beach and absolutely people bring up VIP.\nSpeaker 2: And it's a source of pride I know for myself. And it will continue to be so. Thank you so much again.\nSpeaker 0: I think you killed two women, Price.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I want to echo the comments of my colleagues. And I have to tell you guys.\nSpeaker 3: That those of you who spoke tonight, some of the most.\nSpeaker 2: Eloquent words I have ever heard being on this council and spoken with sincerity, authenticity and so much respect, respect for the person you see as a mentor. Respect for each other.\nSpeaker 3: Respect for us as a council.\nSpeaker 2: We don't always see that. And I have to tell you, it made me want to just stop and listen to everything you were saying, because it was just from a place of goodness and from a place of passion.\nSpeaker 2: But understanding.\nSpeaker 3: Your.\nSpeaker 2: Audience and understanding how important it is to convey your experience in such a positive way, it really, really was impactful for me, I think, to the Anderson Brothers. I learned a lot tonight from hearing from everyone speak. And I don't know if this is true.\nSpeaker 3: You guys have.\nSpeaker 2: To tell me if this is true or not. But I get the sense that, Calvin, that you're a very humble person.\nSpeaker 3: And that you help people. But it's not for you. It's not about getting credit.\nSpeaker 2: It's not about making sure that everyone knows.\nSpeaker 3: That you did something. It really is about.\nSpeaker 2: Is that right? Am I. Is that him? Yeah. It's about really making a difference. And it sounds like what he cares about most is not himself, not promoting himself. It's about every single one of you who got opportunities I love.\nSpeaker 2: I forgot your name, sir.\nSpeaker 3: What? The guy was trying to sell us the beautiful shirt right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your words were really.\nSpeaker 2: Really beautiful in my in my day job. I'm a prosecutor, and I always look at folks who give people a second chance, give them a chance to learn the lessons and do the right thing. And people like Calvin are really hard to come by.\nSpeaker 2: I don't see them very often, and I respect that on such a deep level. So obviously that agenda item tonight, it's it's a no brainer. But to me, I feel like this was such an eye opening experience for me.\nSpeaker 2: I learned so much that I didn't know and I'm so.\nSpeaker 3: Grateful that there are people like you here. Frankly, I'd love to have people like you all around my community too.\nSpeaker 2: Because when we talk about struggles, every community has got some sort of struggle or stress or something that they need mentorship with to make sure that they make good choices. And I'm so grateful that you guys came here tonight.\nSpeaker 2: I really feel I was as I was listening to you talk and sharing, you said something about and I say sharing because I'm Persian and that's.\nSpeaker 3: How we say it.\nSpeaker 2: But you said something that I loved, which was, you know, we may butt heads, but we are family. And you consider that family? And I you know, I'm one of those people who really believes we have to respect one another in that situation.\nSpeaker 2: And so I you guys taught me a lot as you were talking, I was thinking to myself.\nSpeaker 3: I'm so glad.\nSpeaker 2: I like Vice Mayor Richardson was saying, I'm so glad I'm able to be a part of this. It really is one of those memorable moments because Councilman Andrews hit it right on the on the head. We don't have a lot of African-American speakers come to council to speak.\nSpeaker 2: And when and tonight to me.\nSpeaker 3: Said a.\nSpeaker 2: Lot to me about who you are, what you think about your community, the level of respect you have for the system. Thank you. Thank you for that. And Councilman Andrews, you are. You are Calvin Anderson. You know that, right?\nSpeaker 3: You're one of those people who does so much good for your community and you never are promoting.\nSpeaker 2: Yourself.\nSpeaker 3: Ever. He is. The man is just a class act. He does it.\nSpeaker 2: Because it's the right thing to do. He fights for jobs. He fights for opportunity. He fights for his.\nSpeaker 3: District, too, to move up and get.\nSpeaker 2: Advance. And he does it with so much class. To me, I look up to him as a mentor on this council and I thank you guys for honoring and respecting that because he deserved that tonight. So thanks for bringing asylum.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: When I entered the chambers tonight among you, I saw a mentor of mine. And so I got to sit in the crowd tonight with him and feel your passion and pride as each of you got in line to speak.\nSpeaker 2: And we kind of chatted about some of your stories and the things that are going on in each of your lives and the mission and vision that you've had for VIP records. And it's fine. And during your speaking, I came up with three words, and I think these are three words that a lot of people could learn\nSpeaker 2: a lot from your testimony here today. And that is.\nSpeaker 3: You came to the table with solutions. You always have. You come to the table with hope and you always offer sweat equity. It's not a donation of $80,000. It's an investment.\nSpeaker 2: And I appreciate that. In your discussions and dialog, you talked a lot about what the city's meant to you, and that's really identifiable, but also thanking those that have worked with you along the way. And so I'll also give some credit not only to our own Councilmember Dee Andrews, but our economic development team that works full time\nSpeaker 2: to make sure these things become a reality. And so for that, I, of course, am 100%. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Remember your anger. Thank you, Mayor. You know, I can't remember a day ever driving down PCH.\nSpeaker 7: And not seeing that site.\nSpeaker 0: That I can't remember that ever. It is a little bittersweet today because we're talking about a sign, but we're talking about a lot more than that when we talk about.\nSpeaker 7: The owner of the store and the meaning of Long Beach and the meaning that it has that it carries for central Long.\nSpeaker 0: Beach. I was a community college trustee at City College, and I go down a lot on my way to the PCC campus and I would always see it.\nSpeaker 7: And they'd always be some cooking out there.\nSpeaker 0: Some kind of barbecue going on and smoke. And it it brings back some fond memories. And my hope is that it stays on PCH somewhere, preferably there. That's going to be the struggle. That's going to be the challenge.\nSpeaker 7: But that would be my hope and my dream to keep it where it's at. And I would be 100% on this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Super. Thank you. I, too, will be supporting this item tonight. And I'd like to thank everyone for being here tonight and speaking and in special thanks to the Andrews. I think the Andrews and I are probably the only ones are old enough to remember when the sign was originally erected and part of a kind\nSpeaker 0: of a mini urban renewal on the PCH quarter back in the day. And two things I'm very struck by. Number one, that anything in Long Beach has lasted that long. We're real good at tearing things down, but we need to preserve a lot of our historical items such as this.\nSpeaker 0: The second thing that struck me tonight was the statement that worldwide we're known for two things the VIP sign and the Queen Mary. Now, staff, as I recall, I think the city has spent upwards over $200 million on the Queen Mary.\nSpeaker 0: So when you look at it, I think the VIP sign might be the biggest PR bargain the city has ever had.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you very. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you again. I think to to the power of of of the moment and the importance of the item. And we we really have everyone speak on an item, but everyone wanted to to give the remarks and some of that.\nSpeaker 0: I'm going to close. And before we vote, let me let me just say just, of course, to Mr. Anderson, but really to that just to the Anderson family. I know there's a lot of folks here, so thank you for your service to Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: I've told you this before. I'll continue to say it tonight and whenever I can. I think that it's really important that tonight we we designate this an important historic landmark for the city. But it's really about honoring you and honoring your family.\nSpeaker 0: And I think that just want to make sure that we don't miss that as part of of the moment. Clearly, your devotion as a black business owner, as a family that brought so many people in during difficult times in our city's modern history, whether it was some of the photos that we saw, we remember what happened during\nSpeaker 0: the riots and during other difficult times in in Long Beach is history. But really, the region's history of VIP has been such an important part of that. I also want to say I, I always say this. I like to and it brings me back to my younger days.\nSpeaker 0: But I say the first the first record I ever bought with Doggystyle by Snoop Dogg. I listen to it nonstop. I can still recite probably almost every lyric from the album. I love hip hop, I love the history and VIP's, an important part of of that history.\nSpeaker 0: I also think it's really important and it's something that that Mr. Anderson said, which I think is really important and something that's been repeated a few times. It should not be lost on us that we have so few historical landmarks that honor, first and foremost, the black experience and black Americans in Long Beach, because regardless of of\nSpeaker 0: other communities, whether it's the Latino community or the LGBTQ community or others, the black history goes back extensively and has been a huge part of the development of Long Beach. And if you look at. Recent histories that have been written about Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: And there are some there is absolutely a lack of coverage of the black experience and and what the African-American community contributed to the growth of the city from business creation, from the development of our school system, from the civil rights movement.\nSpeaker 0: There's so many black leaders that were involved in the civil rights movement. And so you're starting to see, particularly in the last few years, a recognition, long overdue of the contribution of black Americans in Long Beach. And you're seeing it finally in some of the naming of our schools in the what's happening tonight and in other ways\nSpeaker 0: , which I think are really important. And so I would just challenge us as a city. And I'm also speaking to the staff from Mr. West on down. I would challenge us as a city that we have to do a much better job of recognizing and honoring the black experience in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: And also just just to conclude, I'll say that I think we've you've heard loud and clear that this this council, every single one is very supportive of this. But also, I think you've heard that we're also very supportive of what VIP means and what's the next step, because we know today closes each a chapter on the restoration\nSpeaker 0: side. But we're very aware that there is much more to do and much more and other ways that we will recognize the Anderson legacy and the VIP legacy in Long Beach. And we're all I know I am and others are very interested in that.\nSpeaker 0: I do want to say first, Councilman Andrews, thank you so much for your leadership and support. You and I have had many conversations about this, and I just want to thank you for we wouldn't be here without your support.\nSpeaker 0: I want to thank Sharon. Listen, your you hustle and you did a great job of of inserting yourself sometimes in uncomfortable moments by inserting yourself to ensure that people listened and and took this process seriously. And I want to just personally thank you for that.\nSpeaker 0: I think I thank you for the friendship that we have built. But thank you for pushing the city, especially our staff team, to really understand how important culturally this is. Not just beyond just being a sign, this is a culturally important experience.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank you for that. And then lastly, just all the folks that are here. Thank you for coming out, speaking out. This is an important moment for all of you, for the black community, for hip hop, for VIP, for the Anderson family.\nSpeaker 0: And you have my commitment and I know you have the staff's commitment to really continue doing this kind of work. And again. Mr. Andrews, thank you. Yes. And in closing. Sure. Go ahead. Yes, in closing, I just want to say, I want to thank all of my people coming out tonight and really showing, you know, respect and\nSpeaker 0: dignity. But we really was very important. And even to be able to have Mr. Pay, you know, when you can keep him in line. You guys did a great job. I just want to let you know and thank you very much, every one of you coming out tonight.\nSpeaker 0: Again, thank you. Thank you. Let's go ahead and take a vote, please. I understand.\nSpeaker 3: Motion case.\nSpeaker 0: Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you. Okay. Thank you all. We're going to continue with the rest of the agenda. Thank you all for for coming out. I do have the consent calendar in front of us.\n",

And that note that you are available for questions from the council speakers will have 3 minutes. There is no yielding of time because this is a courtesy public hearing.\nSpeaker 0: The presentation monitor on the wall you'll see your time countdowns. Speakers will stay on the topic of the hearing and direct their comments to members of council as a whole. Please refrain from profane, obscene speech. Direct your. I already said that.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. No personal attacks. Councilman Sussman. Dr. Sussman, please put Council Resolution 111 on the floor.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Mr. President, I move that council resolution 111 be adopted.\nSpeaker 0: It has been moved. And second it the public hearing for council resolution 111 is open. We have the staff report. Laura brzezinski, hello. Hello. Welcome back.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. Thank you. Members of council for having me. I'm Laura brzezinski with the Office of Economic Development in our Housing Division. I'm just going to provide a brief overview of the staff report here. I know this is a topic that we've talked extensively about over the last several months, so I will try to keep this brief\nSpeaker 10: . But first, I want to acknowledge many of the folks in this room and those who might be watching for the hard work and hours that they've put into this process over almost a year at this point. I want to acknowledge enterprise community partners, the Corporation for Supportive Housing and Community Strategies Institute that served as the consultants on\nSpeaker 10: this plan, collecting data and overseeing plan development. I want to thank our Housing Advisory Committee, who put in a number of hours over many months on this. I want to thank members of the public and council members who have also spent time providing feedback on the proposal you hear you see tonight, as well as reviewing the document\nSpeaker 10: itself. So thank you. We are excited to bring forward this plan for council approval. This is really the first housing plan that the city has had that addresses housing needs across the entire spectrum, from homelessness to rental housing to workforce and affordable homeownership.\nSpeaker 10: So with that, I am pleased to bring forward this presentation on the purpose of the comprehensive housing plan, which you can see is in section 27 164 of the municipal code. The purpose of the plan is to guide investments of city housing expenditures by the Office of Economic Development in the Housing Development, Preservation and Programs.\nSpeaker 10: There's a few outlines required elements of that plan, including an overview of housing resources, setting measurable goals for the investment of Housing Resources by Amy. Category Goals for unit development, preservation and programmatic investments, including a mix of for sale and rental units.\nSpeaker 10: Systems to track areas of the city that are vulnerable to gentrification and displacement and stabilize residents in those areas who might be at risk of displacement. And then to recommend key actions and strategies to address the need for supportive services, land acquisition and mixed income development.\nSpeaker 10: There was significant outreach conducted, as I mentioned, as part of this process, including surveys during planned development and during the public comment period where the plan was open for review in 2017 with more than 1200 responses. Both of those were conducted in English as well as in Spanish.\nSpeaker 10: We held five public meetings in 2017 with more than 250 attendees. Those were meetings distributed across the city. We held focus groups with experts from homelessness, rental and homeownership areas to inform our recommendations along the housing spectrum. We had a number of different council meetings, including a full working session in the summer of 2017 for presentations to\nSpeaker 10: the Safety Committee and individual meetings with many of you. So thank you for your time invested in each of those. We also had a number of presentations and meetings with specific stakeholder organizations, as well as monthly meetings with our Housing Advisory Committee in addition to open office hours.\nSpeaker 10: Feedback collected during the plan development helped to refine our policy and investment strategies that you will see tonight, including the prioritization of resources along the housing continuum. I know the next two slides are information that's familiar to council members, but just for a brief overview, the plan contains four fundamental values.\nSpeaker 10: Leveraging and enhancing our housing investments to support the creation of inclusive communities throughout Denver. Identifying ways to support communities of opportunity. Recognizing that certainly housing is an important component to wealth building, but also transportation access, economic mobility through job creation, education and health care.\nSpeaker 10: Other component important elements of building communities of opportunity as well viewing housing as a continuum that serves residents across a range of needs and incomes, and then certainly embracing neighborhood diversity. To accomplish those fundamental values. The plan outlines four key goals creating affordability in vulnerable areas as well as in areas of opportunity, preserving affordability and housing quality\nSpeaker 10: , promoting equitable and accessible housing options, and then stabilizing residents at risk of involuntary displacement. The plan also contains a recommendation for the investment of resources from the Office of Economic Development. Along the income continuum, 40 to 50% of our resources will be invested to serve residents earning below 30% of the area.\nSpeaker 10: Median income. That's about $17,000 for an individual and those who are experiencing homelessness. You can see the breakdowns 20 to 25% for residents experiencing homelessness and 20 to 25% for residents earning below 30% AMI underneath that broader category.\nSpeaker 10: In addition to those resources, 20 to 30% of our housing investments will serve a slightly higher income population on the rental housing side through development, preservation and programs for those earning 31 to 80% AMI and then 20 to 30% of our housing resources invested to serve residents who either are homeowners and want to stay in the homes\nSpeaker 10: they already own or who are seeking to become homeowners. There are a number of different goals outlined in this plan. Housing an Inclusive Denver. We are aiming to create or preserve approximately 3000 units over the next five years and serve 30,000 households through our programmatic investments to stabilize residents at risk of displacement and helping those who are\nSpeaker 10: seeking to obtain housing access new housing opportunities. Part of the reason why these numbers are informed the way that they are is that you can see from the last slide that we have a target of serving a majority of our resources to the lowest income populations.\nSpeaker 10: Serving those populations requires typically a higher per unit investment. So that is accounted for as part of these projections compared to higher army units, especially on the rental side. We have made some updates to the plan that's submitted for your approval tonight, including some feedback from our meeting with the safety committee just a couple of weeks ago\nSpeaker 10: , including a couple of changes to recognize the nexus between jobs and housing and the relationship between public and private investment, rising housing costs, and what impact that has on residents who are at risk of displacement. We have also added some other items through the plan updates over the last several weeks, including a more specific timeline and evaluation\nSpeaker 10: criteria for exploring additional housing resources more effectively. Coordinating our language in this plan with the language in the gentrification and displacement study that was released in 2016 by the Office of Economic Development, focusing on long term affordability in our housing investments, strengthening the language around comprehensive, comprehensive eviction assistance in the plan.\nSpeaker 10: Updating some of our language to explore community land trust with diverse input in a variety of factors in terms of our evaluation and then some overall updates to the plan structure to make it easier to navigate. We certainly recognize that we have a lot of next steps as part of the implementation of this plan, including finalizing some\nSpeaker 10: of our 2018 action planning with input from our housing advisory committee and certainly input that we received from the safety committee that met at the end of January. We are also looking at how to best support our Housing Advisory Committee in refining the role and structure, including the work plan for 2018 and the ongoing reporting of investments\nSpeaker 10: and outcomes. We are also working internally to OED with input from our advisory committee and other stakeholders to update our financial products to better align with the priorities you see here to serve the lowest income populations with our investments into development, preservation and programs, and then in integrating the plan priorities here into how we evaluate new opportunities\nSpeaker 10: for investments. Certainly, we are also working to further coordinate our housing and affordability investments defined as some of the other investments that we have in the city along this spectrum, in agencies such as the Department of Human Services, Denver's Road Home and some other rental assistance and supportive housing investments the city makes that are outside of OED\nSpeaker 10: . We are also working to provide clarity on the front door for new housing programs. We have a lot of really good ideas that are coming to us in the city for opportunities that align with this housing plan. So we're working on clarifying how new programs can come into the pipeline and how we can foster those.\nSpeaker 10: So with that, staff recommends City Council approval of 18 zero zero or 0111 to adopt housing an inclusive Denver.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you. We have. Ten speakers this evening. I'm going to call you all up to the front row in multiples of five. All right, Helen Taylor, Tim Kraft, Jonathan Capella, Capelli, Emily Bustos and Aaron Meeropol. Helen Taylor, you are first.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, I'm Helen.\nSpeaker 6: Taylor at Northeast Denver Housing Center 1735 Gaylord.\nSpeaker 4: Street, Denver.\nSpeaker 1: I'm speaking on behalf.\nSpeaker 6: Of Northeast Denver.\nSpeaker 4: Housing Center and Del Norte Development Corporation and in support of the True Tour program, which is known as a temporary rental and utility assistance.\nSpeaker 6: Program. In the short time of.\nSpeaker 4: Four months, the program has helped over 440 households facing eviction.\nSpeaker 6: Or the loss of their home and at risk of becoming.\nSpeaker 4: Homeless. We have assisted 91 people with disabilities.\nSpeaker 6: 45 seniors over the age.\nSpeaker 4: Of 60.\nSpeaker 1: To 325.\nSpeaker 6: Female head of households.\nSpeaker 4: The households are experiencing job losses, medical hardship and decrease in household income. Without true, and most of these families would be facing eviction. Our processes.\nSpeaker 6: Continue to.\nSpeaker 4: Improve to provide service in an efficient and timely manner. We have also assisted 62 families with utility assistance. The Comprehensive.\nSpeaker 6: Housing Plan for Denver will need to.\nSpeaker 4: Balance its approach and expenditures by making sure that most at risk and vulnerable are protected. The continued.\nSpeaker 6: Demand for housing and associated.\nSpeaker 4: Increase in rent will challenge low to.\nSpeaker 6: Moderate income households.\nSpeaker 4: The adage.\nSpeaker 6: Of one paycheck.\nSpeaker 4: Away from crisis is truly happening.\nSpeaker 6: In Denver today. We are seeing household.\nSpeaker 4: With certain medical expenses, auto repairs, reduction.\nSpeaker 1: Of income.\nSpeaker 9: Being giving.\nSpeaker 4: Eviction notices within five days and escalating late.\nSpeaker 6: Fees.\nSpeaker 4: The true program is critically.\nSpeaker 6: Needed to help families that need the.\nSpeaker 4: Space and time to manage and overcome short term challenges on behalf of the residents and community we serve. We encourage the city council to continue this program. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Ms.. Taylor. Tim Craft.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity. Tim Craft, 2500 Cherry Creek Drive South in Denver. Also a Denver based small business owner represented of the Home Builders Association of Metro Denver, as well as a real estate developer generally in favor of the bill.\nSpeaker 5: However, I would like to express a couple of concerns. First, I think many of the estimates in it are actually a little bit low. I think the demand on Denver proper is going to be even greater in terms of affordable and attainable housing than is what I identified in the report as growing anti-growth sentiment develops and in\nSpeaker 5: some of the suburban areas and neighboring municipalities. We do anticipate additional demand for tenable housing in Denver proper. Would also caution about the the impact of both additional impact fees as well as mills. Ultimately, in the research that we've done, it typically leads to a greater disparity, a greater gap between what's called in the report affordable and\nSpeaker 5: attainable housing. Simply put, it's hard to make something more affordable by making it more expensive. Then, beyond that, the council to consider potentially delaying fees, not necessarily the affordable fees, but fees across the board that will ultimately help make some of the larger products that can actually move and make a bigger impact on Attainability until later in\nSpeaker 5: the process. So to give an example, say a 300 unit, either apartment building or condominium building. For every dollar that's imposed upfront at the time of building permit, typically after the cost of capital equates to roughly $2 by the time of build out.\nSpeaker 5: And then, of course, that's passed along to the either the renter or the home buyer. Thank you very much for the time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Kraft. Jonathan Capelli.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you for letting me speak my name Jonathan Peli. I'm a Denver resident and the director of the Neighborhood Development Collaborative, which is a coalition of 13 housing development nonprofits based in metro Denver. And our list them all really quick.\nSpeaker 3: Northeast Denver Housing Center del Norte New said Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver. Denver Urban Renewal Authority, Urban Land Conservancy Archway. Rocky Mountain Communities Cowal Community Resources or Community Resource and Housing Investment Corporation Coalition for the Homeless and Colorado Housing Assistance Corp. and the Condo Committee Land Trust.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, so together, since 2009, we have created over 4600 affordable homes in Denver and also helped an additional 4000 families through housing cost assistance, downpayment assistance, rehabilitation, foreclosure prevention and have also helped 35,000 residents through housing counseling. So in short, we are the organizations that are going to be delivering on a large portion of the goals that\nSpeaker 3: are outlined in the plan. So what do we think about the plan? Well, through the work of a lot of our members on the hack, as well as individual meetings that I've already had with many of you on the council, you've heard that we still strongly feel that the city needs to work on creating ambitious goals that\nSpeaker 3: are targeted to alleviating the housing crisis by reducing the percentage of housing cost burden households in Denver. And then also by raising enough dollars to fund those goals once we create them. We've also voiced the need for Denver to work to partner more closely with nonprofit housing developers that will be developing the services or providing the services\nSpeaker 3: that are outlined in the plan. And also, we hope that in the future the city will rely on the hack to a greater degree to create and improve housing policy. However, insofar as this document is a road map for spending $150 million, the first half of $150 million fund, we actually think it's a great plan.\nSpeaker 3: Over its 100 plus pages. There's a ton of really great housing policies and programs that if we actually move on them and implement them, we think will really help us and other organizations that work in the housing realm to do their work.\nSpeaker 3: We think the Division of Housing Product types and by EMI was also well done, even though that's usually a really difficult decision. And we're also pleased that the plan includes language just to explore new sources of housing funding.\nSpeaker 3: So given all the, you know, issues with increasing land values and rent prices and everything, rent costs, everything is going on the city. We're really, really glad that the city council worked the comprehensive housing plan into the housing fund that got passed last year, and that you're considering it right now.\nSpeaker 3: And we look forward to working with you to deliver on the plan and also to, you know, bring more funding and work to increase the scope of the goals in the future, but approve of this plan. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Right on time. Thank you. Mr. Capelli. Emily Bustos.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. My name is Emily Bustos. I'm executive director of Denver's Early Childhood Council. I'm also a Denver resident. I'm here tonight representing the early childhood education community who advocates and represents a wide range of Denver's population. We often act as the voice for educators, parents and their children here in Denver.\nSpeaker 1: And as you know, as of 2017, more than 33,000 children in Denver are living in poverty. If this remains the status quo, 40% of low income students will not graduate high school. And half of Colorado families will not earn high enough wages to sustain their families.\nSpeaker 1: With that being said, we would like to echo the sentiments made in our last public letter from September of 2016. A city that allows its affordable housing supply to dwindle also weakens its schools, as affordable housing is the backbone to true affordability and access and creating a thriving, family friendly city.\nSpeaker 1: We think this is very important. We applaud Denver City Council as on passing our city's first local affordable housing fund. And we believe that the city is taking significant steps in the right direction to address the widespread, widespread displacement of longstanding Denver residents.\nSpeaker 1: We recognize the impact of 150 million affordable housing fund, but our excitement comes with a dose of apprehension. It has come to our attention that there is no mention of permanent, affordable housing anywhere in the city's initial recommendations, which we believe that affordable, permanent affordability is critical to the long term success of our families and children here\nSpeaker 1: in Denver. Today, our city is facing a shortage of affordable housing options. And according to the latest report published by Shift Research Lab, the crisis is largely a supply issue. This report exploring Colorado's affordable housing affordability challenges and all of their complexity states that households under $50,000 a year spend more than 35% of their income on housing\nSpeaker 1: alone. These households are the families we serve, as well as the teachers that educate our children here in Denver. How can we move forward with a clear conscience, knowing full well that many of our students are on a path on the precipice of leaving our school systems due to lack of affordability?\nSpeaker 1: In 2006, Denver voters approved a 2.12% sales tax, which created the Denver Preschool Program, an organization that makes preschool possible for all Denver families. In 2014, Denver voters reauthorized the tax, this time increasing funding 2.15% since its inception and through the close of 20 1617.\nSpeaker 1: That program has served and provided nearly 93 million intuition support to close to 46,000 children. Over the last 30 years, there's been a growing demand for early care and education services here in Denver for families of all socioeconomic backgrounds.\nSpeaker 1: The field of B.C. has faced significant challenges in attracting and maintaining the skilled, diverse and stable workforce that's needed to nurture our youngest children. Thank you for your time. We we're more than happy to answer any questions to provide additional resources.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Bustos. Erin Murphy.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening. My name is Aaron Mariupol, a little bit 38. 39 was 29th Avenue, Denver resident. And I'm also the president of the Urban Land Conservancy. First thing I wanted to tell you is thank you. What you have done.\nSpeaker 7: The step forward and passing 6 to 5 in September of 2016. Moving forward with a plan, a housing plan. A five year plan. Is something that's been long needed. And I know it wasn't easy, but it was something you guys took the bold step forward on.\nSpeaker 7: And we really want to share with you how much we respect that. It wasn't easy, as I said. I've been working in affordable housing now for over 30 years. I started in this work as a tenant organizer, worked on national housing policy issues, as well as local housing issues.\nSpeaker 7: And I will tell you, you have made a huge step forward as a community. And it bottom line, it's about our community, our people that we serve. You will see has invested over $60 million here in Denver. That's leveraged another 300 plus million in redevelopment.\nSpeaker 7: It's a range of affordable housing, nonprofit facilities, schools. We serve over 1000 people a year. Despite the work that we've done, what we're seeing and you going to be hearing, obviously, is that the affordable housing issue has only gotten worse.\nSpeaker 7: And so how do we get forward and how do we address this? You've done it with the fund, a plan. And then I would add, the piece that I think is really critical that you do need to consider is having permit affordability in this housing plan.\nSpeaker 7: Currently, it does not state it and it needs to be in. And when I talk about permanent affordable housing, we're talking about multiple generations. We're not talking about a one off. So we know that there are examples today in Denver where there's a 15 year deed restriction and it's burning off and it's going to market.\nSpeaker 7: We cannot allow that to happen going forward. We need to be the stewards as a community of the investments that we're making going forward in affordable housing for the long term. So you've gotten letters from us in the past.\nSpeaker 7: I think you know that you also strongly endorses community land trust work. We do it in multifamily and in commercial real estate. We think it is an important tool. The city has certainly talked about it as part of in the housing plan.\nSpeaker 7: We think that's a great step forward. Jan reading short term deed restrictions 30 years or less should not be approved. We should be moving forward with a minimum of a 50 year covenant on affordability or using a land trust, which is actually 198 years to 99 year leases.\nSpeaker 7: We're on the ground. We understand what the true cost of affordable housing development is, and we really, really, really ask for you to think about this permanent, affordable housing as a component of the housing plan. We really think it's important.\nSpeaker 7: At the end of the day, as I said, it's about the people. We have far too many folks in our properties that. But for us, there's not another opportunity in this community. And so we really do need to think about a permanent solution.\nSpeaker 7: Mr. Tanner, thank you very much for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you for your comments. All right. I'm going to call the next five up. Andrew Romero, T.A. Peterson, Brad SIEGEL, Will. Crawl. Crawl. Wilk, Richie, Rene Martinez Stone. Sorry about that. Well, okay. Uh, Mr. Romero, you up first.\nSpeaker 4: Amanda Romero.\nSpeaker 9: Resident in Jefferson Park neighborhood. I am here representing the Colorado Latino Forum. I'm on the board of the Colorado Latino Forum. We at the Latino Forum are concerned, of course, like everybody else, about the significant issues that we face with displacement, housing costs and the lack of high income jobs that can support those high housing units.\nSpeaker 9: Overall, our housing budget and the city of Denver is approximately $2,022 million a year. When we compare ourselves to a comparable city, Seattle, which has 700,000 people as well, their budget is over $100 million a year. So that's five times our budget.\nSpeaker 9: And so we know we can do more because we see other cities doing more. They're doing it through a variety of mechanisms. They're using mills. They're bonding those mills. The city budget is about $30 million of that 100 million.\nSpeaker 9: And then they have significant investments from the private sector. Paul Allen gave one project $30 million last year. Maybe we don't have somebody like Paul Allen here, but we certainly have people we think that we can partner with the private sector, corporations, foundations to do a better job on this issue.\nSpeaker 9: So we support the core goals of the plan. We support the plan. And who would not support the plan. It's got great ideas. What we think, though, is that we just don't see where the funding is to make this plan effective.\nSpeaker 9: And what we don't want to see is the plan to just sit up on the shelf. So we would very much advocate various ideas that are out there, including all in Denver, which has suggested a housing bond. They've suggested additional mills in reallocating funds from the overall city budget.\nSpeaker 9: So we would like the council and the city to look at different options for increasing funds. We we also feel very strongly that the community land trust model is something that will very significantly impact our communities in a positive way, especially broken down into the neighborhood level.\nSpeaker 9: And we encourage some of the funding to go toward those efforts. Kdka's and nonprofit groups are some of the best organizations in our town and being able to allocate and get administer funds and get them out to the community.\nSpeaker 9: So we'd like to see more language around that in this plan. In closing, the plan isn't perfect, but it's a step in the right direction and obviously has. I think it could. We think it can use more details in some of the implementation.\nSpeaker 9: And tomorrow, more funds.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Your time is up. Thank you. Thank you. Deanna Patterson.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. My name is Tiana Patterson. I'm a resident of Denver, and I'm the state and local policy director for Enterprise Community Partners. I'm here to speak my support of approval of y'all approving this plan. Sorry. My Southern ness just came out.\nSpeaker 1: I had the distinct pleasure of serving as an on the ground liaison for Enterprise Advisors as they worked with the city on crafting this housing plan. Although I was not directly involved in writing this housing plan, I did work with the advisors by providing them with context on Denver.\nSpeaker 1: And I want to commend the city for listening to the needs of the community and experts in the housing field by incorporating and addressing the issues so robustly in the housing plan. For instance, the recommendation to leverage publicly owned land for affordable housing development.\nSpeaker 1: As many of us know, acquisition of land has been and continues to be one of the biggest barriers to producing more affordable housing. And we believe this is a great first step towards addressing and overcoming this issue. I have been personally impressed by the robust engagement with the public and the end of the community.\nSpeaker 1: Concerns have also been reflected in this housing plan. Specifically, the recommendations on enhancing renter protections and the creation of a community land trust were both spoken about passionately by community members at Housing Advisory Committee meetings and other public comment opportunities.\nSpeaker 1: Community members have been grappling with gentrification and displacement, and these two initiatives show that the city has listened and wants to work to keep people in place, stabilize communities and address the concerns over the community. I believe that this plan is a great first step in making Denver a more inclusive and accessible and robust community for all\nSpeaker 1: . And I hope that your support support moving this plan forward. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Ms.. Patterson. Brett SIEGEL.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. My name is Brad SIEGEL. I'm a Denver native.\nSpeaker 3: I'm a Congress Park resident in beautiful District ten. And tonight I am speaking as a co-founder of All in Denver. All in Denver is a nonprofit advocacy organization, and we believe an equitable city is where all people have the opportunity to to prosper and thrive.\nSpeaker 3: Regarding the housing plan, we support the housing plan. We've monitored the progress of it and commend not only the city, but all the volunteers who've been involved in putting it together. We have actually from last from the fall of 2016 when the dedicated fund was formed.\nSpeaker 3: However, we have been advocating for more funding. So tonight I'm here to simply reiterate a position paper that we sent to council back in December that provides a roadmap on how an additional $150 million surge could be directed toward housing within the next 3 to 5 years.\nSpeaker 3: The good news is we already have a dedicated fund which over ten years potentially has $150 million. The four ways to accelerate that, number one, is to look at next year's budget and general fund.\nSpeaker 4: What a great way to.\nSpeaker 3: Launch the housing plan and double down on the 15 million that's expected for next year. So we're proposing that the administration and council consider another $15 million allocation from the general fund in 2019.\nSpeaker 4: Secondly, we're recommending that the council.\nSpeaker 3: Remove the sunset that was originally placed within the dedicated fund. If you'll recall, there was a ten year sunset that's now at nine years.\nSpeaker 4: We feel that handicaps the utility.\nSpeaker 3: Of the fund. We feel it's shortsighted. And we understand that council action could reverse that, could eliminate that sunset attack. Perhaps if we feel bold and inspired, we could.\nSpeaker 4: Consider that this evening. Third item on our list.\nSpeaker 3: Was to add an additional half mile under the De Bruce, saying that the city participated in a couple of years ago. There's the ability to.\nSpeaker 4: Actually add additional.\nSpeaker 3: Funds.\nSpeaker 4: Through Mill Levy. And then our fourth.\nSpeaker 3: And final idea, which we talked about back in September of 16, is the notion of taking this to the voters. We do feel it's a number one priority for the city.\nSpeaker 4: And whether it's a property.\nSpeaker 3: Tax, a sales tax or another mechanism bond the funds. So we accelerate the funding and get the dollars in today. The following speaker.\nSpeaker 4: Will karlovic.\nSpeaker 3: Will talk about the bonding in further detail. But we feel it's even more important a recommendation today with reckless economic policy in Washington.\nSpeaker 4: There could be more inflation.\nSpeaker 3: Over the next several years, which could diminish the value of the existing fund.\nSpeaker 4: And then lastly, when we brought this.\nSpeaker 3: To you in 2016, this was a fairly novel idea. Since then, more than three dozen jurisdictions have issued housing bonds throughout the West and throughout the country. So, again, thank you. We support the plan and we hope this is a springboard into looking at more funding.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Segal. Well, Brockovich. Sorry about that.\nSpeaker 9: No good jack name. My name is Will Karlovic. I'm a proud 15 year resident of Denver at 2828 Zuni Street. I'm speaking here today as a board member of All in Denver. And I want to supplement what Brad SIEGEL has just spoken about.\nSpeaker 9: In particular. I'm here to introduce a new concept for your consideration that here now has not been part of the conversation, and that is the concept of time, value of money. I urge you to listen up. The next 90 seconds is your MBA in finance and corporate finance.\nSpeaker 9: Analyzing time value of money is a correct way to compare to competing investment options. Because of inflation, a dollar, six years, seven years, eight years from today is not going to be worth the dollar that it is today.\nSpeaker 9: Likewise, when we talk about 15 million available in each of the ten years of the dedicated fund adding up to $150 million in present value terms. That's actually a fallacy depending on what interest rate is used. That $150 million in today's dollars actually equates to only about 115 million to 120 million.\nSpeaker 9: All in Denver has done a present value analysis comparing the dedicated fund pay as you go option against a housing bond option. And again, depending what interest rate is or inflation rate is used in present value terms, they actually come out to be about equal, however.\nSpeaker 9: There's a couple of considerations that if construction prices continue to rise and property values continue to rise, which there's no reason not to expect, those then future dollars will have less value than today. And as Brad said, if the US economy is headed for higher inflationary times, which many people predict the present value buying power of the\nSpeaker 9: dedicated fund in the guise of a housing bond is going to be worth more today and be able to contribute more to addressing the affordable housing crisis we have. As one example, if a 4% inflation rate is used, a housing bond actually has a greater present value buying power today than the half mil of the dedicated fund\nSpeaker 9: in a pay as you go scenario. So simply put, when options are looked at as corporate finance, investment really should be analyzed, a housing bond has the potential of actually giving the city more bang for the buck, which therefore makes a housing bond potentially a more fiscally conservative and fiscally responsible thing for the city to do.\nSpeaker 9: And for all of you to consider. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. All right. For that MBA lesson. Ms.. Renee Martinez Stone.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening. My name is Rene Martinez Stone. I'm a resident of Denver, and I speak to you tonight as the director of the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative here in Denver. The West Denver Renaissance Collaborative includes nine wonderful neighborhoods in Denver.\nSpeaker 11: It's home to many residents that have achieved the American dream of homeownership. It is also working class families whose wages are not keeping pace with housing costs, with rents, with property taxes. These neighborhoods have all been identified as vulnerable, and there are families at risk of having to lose their homes in north in west Denver.\nSpeaker 11: This has been a priority for the neighborhoods, and as such, we've created an initiative called the West Denver Single Family Plus Program. This solution provides homeowner education, connects them to key partners providing repairs, and creates a pathway for accessory dwelling unit development for low and middle income families.\nSpeaker 11: This is important because it stabilizes Residents Creek's equitable access to a development tool that's been tried and true for hundreds of years and creates affordable rental units within neighborhoods controlled by homeowners and benefiting homeowners in the city. I want to thank you tonight and staff as well for the work on this plan and express my support for\nSpeaker 11: this work and this plan. Two areas specifically that I will call attention to are the emphasis on raising more funds and needing to do as much as possible, and specifically benefiting projects that leverage money or bring more money to the table.\nSpeaker 11: Really rewarding and standing by those projects. Next I'd like to to express my support for. The how the plan speaks to accessory dwelling units. I believe that it does this in the right way because it calls for 80 used to be a tool for affordability and to stabilize residents who are at risk of displacement if it is\nSpeaker 11: worth expanding and creating policy. I need you. We have to do it in a way that creates a pathway to those residents that need this tool the most. The plan also calls for use as wealth building tools for low and middle income homeowners.\nSpeaker 11: This is innovative. This is not this is being pursued in many other cities across the country. No one is doing it yet. It is worthwhile. And this is a very progressive call. It's not going to be easy at all, though.\nSpeaker 11: It's very difficult in building the ADU program that will be rolling out this year in West Denver. There are many facets to it and there are policy facets to it. There are also the risk of unintended consequences. The plan calls for Blueprint.\nSpeaker 11: Denver laying the groundwork for this. We cannot just blanket the city with additional adu zoning everywhere without including restrictions, priorities or incentives. We could create a backlash where neighborhoods do not and want to resist.\nSpeaker 0: It's this in stone. Our time's up. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Want to thank all the speakers, and that concludes all of the speakers. We are now ready for questions by members of Council Councilman Espinosa, Europe.\nSpeaker 9: Question for Tim Kraft. For? Well, he's walking up. I just want to say here here to what you're asking of blueprint Denver on the use that's important sort of guardrails to making sure that they're angled at mean they're for affordable housing not just sort of.\nSpeaker 0: Question question.\nSpeaker 9: The question he walked up here to fast so I am glad that you mentioned for the first time something that I've been trying to sort of get us to sort of grapple with, which is that cost of the dollar at start versus at the end.\nSpeaker 9: So do you think what do you think the consequences. So right now our linkage fee is fairly meager, is as onerous as some people might think it is. It's it's fairly meager. What do you think the outcomes would be if we were to save that value and allow the developer to pay for that later on?\nSpeaker 9: I mean, because that implies that they're paying for it rather than providing units. So why would we do that?\nSpeaker 5: So the delay would ultimately get passed along to either the homeowner or the renter. Simply put, it's no different than the permit. Fees are very similar to foundation cost. They go in very early and then you carry that during the entire time.\nSpeaker 5: It's easy to look at, say, one specific developer, but ultimately any developer who stands before you guys isn't financing a project with their own money are very few would be, you know, to give an example of how the flow of funds would work, let's take, say, PERA.\nSpeaker 5: So the Colorado Employment Fund, the retirement fund ultimately invests in, say, a private equity group who ultimately invests in guys like us. So they give us a dollar of that dollars on typically 12 months, roughly after the process, the entitlement process has begun.\nSpeaker 5: That's when the permits fees are paid. Then there's another 12. It's 6 to 12 months until you can actually break ground, then say 2 to 5 years construction depending on the size of the project. So assuming that Pedro would like to see call it an 8% return, ultimately that means the deal needs to produce somewhere in the\nSpeaker 5: neighborhood of an 18% return. So to actually deliver that, you're looking at doubling every three and a half years. Which is why I say a dollar upfront ultimately means somewhere in the neighborhood of a buck 75 to $2 at the time of CEO.\nSpeaker 9: So do you. I wish we could play with just the hard cost of the units, but do you think you could come up with four people working on the implementation side? A scenario where if we did two things, essentially effectively do the math of what it would be to defer the fee and defer Sudeep to CEO rather\nSpeaker 9: than, you know, at the time of permitting as well that we could actually capture unit, you know, physical units, especially on private development where we then relax the HUD requirements for units, mix and sizes.\nSpeaker 5: Any deferment and fees will definitely benefit ultimately the occupant, be it an owner or a renter. As far as the other details there, I'm not sure I caught all of it. Again, a recommendation would be and it sounds that's something that almost every speaker who is up here said is that really we're in a supply problem.\nSpeaker 5: So again, from in, there is no bigger proponent for affordable or attainable housing than the HBA. It's what the group does. But to the extent it's more of a care versus the sticks are less of a penalty and more of a benefit.\nSpeaker 5: So I really stress the importance of giving density bonuses for groups that do more affordable housing and the like, reducing or releasing restrictions on, say, heights, that you can actually do more with the land and ultimately, you know, defer the cost of the actual real estate with more height.\nSpeaker 9: Great. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: It's all right, Councilman Cashman.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President. Question for Laura, if I can. So Laura, in numerous places throughout the plan, it talks about the phrases if local and federal resources remain consistent with current levels, then we're going to create 3000 new units, address 30,000 households with various programs.\nSpeaker 4: There seems to be an indication that federal levels won't remain the same. There's at least some concern. I wonder if you could address that and how far along you might be in in contingency thoughts on how we would move forward.\nSpeaker 4: Because this I mean, I spent the weekend reading the whole plan and it touches everything. And so. Yeah, just the finances.\nSpeaker 10: Sure. In terms of federal funds, we will not know our 20 allocation, 2018 allocation likely for several months. There was a continuing resolution passed at the federal level. We do have some contingency funds that allow us to fund our programs until we know what our award is in 2018.\nSpeaker 10: Typically, we find that out somewhere between July and September. So we're funding programs for this year knowing that we might not find that out until a little bit later this year. So we're looking to find that out. The president's proposed budget eliminates funding for housing.\nSpeaker 10: It's a policy document, not necessarily the proposed investment, but it is an indication of what we might see at a federal level, which is a decline in resources. But at this point, we won't know our federal allocation until a little later this year.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. The other question, just wondering when we should expect the rollout of the 2018 action plan and how will that be done? Will that come through committee? How do you anticipate that?\nSpeaker 10: Sure. We have some discussion with our housing advisory committee at the upcoming meeting in March to refine some of that planning. But I'd be happy to take back to the team their request to bring that forward to council.\nSpeaker 10: For an update on what the 2018 Action Plan looks like, I can take that back to the team.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Thank you, Laura. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Thank you. Councilman Cashman. That's from Flynn.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. Excuse me. Rene Martinez. Stone, could you come up and talk a little bit more about what you were going to say about ADOS and and and some of the nuances about them that you didn't get to finish?\nSpeaker 11: Thank you so. He launching a program that really is dependent upon native zoning, really puts you in a position to want more zoning. But one of the things that we've learned in studying cities across the country who are doing the same thing is one of the fundamental things that it does is it increases the rate of return\nSpeaker 11: , typically on investment properties in vulnerable neighborhoods. And so in some cases, the unintended consequences are that you just increase the value of those properties to those who are able to access the financing to not only purchase those properties, but to build a need to you.\nSpeaker 11: So ideas have been zoned in Denver since 2010. We haven't seen a lot of aid use built. You can't really put your finger specifically on why that is. Has to do with financing, has to do with custom design, has to do with a lot of reasons.\nSpeaker 11: So it stands to reason. This isn't with a lot of in-depth study that if you expand zoning, what you're doing is expanding zoning for those who are capable of financing and building it to use. And so without a different pathway, you're not able to expand that tool to middle and low income homeowners.\nSpeaker 11: So a lot of cities are saying, you know, before you broadly increase use zoning, you may want to look at incentives or restrictions or even geographic areas of priority. You may want to look at it's tough to do, but limiting the numbers so that neighborhoods, you know, aren't fearful that they're going to get, you know, 10,000 acres\nSpeaker 11: versus the number that they typically get, which is a small amount.\nSpeaker 8: Do you have any specific suggestions for what this plan should have said regarding those restrictions?\nSpeaker 11: I like that the plan specifically calls for this tool to be to be a tool into achieving affordable units and helping men in low income. I think if if all actions follow that course, they'll be different actions than they would just to expand zoning.\nSpeaker 11: They will be about creating pathways. They will be about looking at accessing you. To use zoning means that you're doing it in geographical priority areas. You're looking at is does the owner have to live on the property or not?\nSpeaker 11: Because if they don't, that really opens the door even wider for investment. It is a tool to expand the number of units, but expanding the number of units in a city through its use has to be done thoughtfully and carefully.\nSpeaker 11: Right. Because it can be if it's done too fast. I mean, and also planning board members. So I hear the number of residents who don't want the problem of an issue. They don't. There's a number of issues that can be made of it.\nSpeaker 11: But as well, when it's framed in the right way, there are neighborhoods and we are talking to residents who like the idea of units being financed and built that they control, that aren't concentrated to create traffic issues that are housing families who are losing the rental units within the existing neighborhood.\nSpeaker 8: Was the group at all concerned with the possibility that folks could have ideas that would essentially they would use as short term rentals and not really to house people on a long term basis, that sort of thing?\nSpeaker 11: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 8: I don't know if that's something we can legislate.\nSpeaker 11: Or not, but it's certainly something we can look at for the West Denver Single Family Plus program, any program, any homeowner that develops an ATV within our program will not be allowed to short term rent their ADU.\nSpeaker 8: Okay, that's under your program.\nSpeaker 11: It is inconsistent not with the wealth building portion. Right. Of our program. It would build a lot of wealth to be able to rent at short term, but it's not consistent with the long term feasibility of promoting you to use as well as them providing an affordable long term solution within neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 11: So all of those elements of a need you all of those potential unintended, unintended consequences are really important to look out.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 4: Laura, can I ask you.\nSpeaker 8: A few things based on the email exchange that we had earlier today, map 2.5 areas vulnerable to displacement relative to neighborhood types. I was sort of scratching my head as to how DIA and Gateway are in the area of considered vulnerable to displacement for obvious reasons that it's an airport.\nSpeaker 8: But also I'm down in my district, Bear Valley, and I've I've never, never had anyone suggests to me that Bear Valley was vulnerable to displacement. So I'm wondering if you could just take a moment to explain the metrics that went in to number crunching that gave us these particular census tracts and neighborhoods that are vulnerable to displacement\nSpeaker 10: . Sure. So the vulnerability index that was part of the 2016 gentrification and displacement study that we'd collected. Put together had three different factors. It looked at the percentage of residents that were renters versus owners. So if there was a higher percentage of renters in a neighborhood, that was one consideration.\nSpeaker 10: It looked at the overall income of the residents in that neighborhood. If the income was lower than the average citywide, that was one of the indicators that might make a neighborhood vulnerable. And then the final factor was the educational attainment of residents in the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 10: So it used the access data in terms of residents who have a bachelor's degree or higher. If the percentage of residents who had less than a bachelor's degree or higher, that was a third factor in the analysis in a neighborhood was identified as vulnerable.\nSpeaker 10: Is it that two out of three of those factors? Okay.\nSpeaker 8: Maybe we could sit down afterward because I'm a little stunned that Bear Valley would have would qualify under any of those. Any of those three compared to all the neighborhoods around it. But let me move on. Other neighborhoods in my district, verbally, West Harvey Park, South Fort Logan and Marston along South Wadsworth is described as a Type\nSpeaker 8: three neighborhood, which is where residents enjoy hip neighborhood restaurants and chic boutiques.\nSpeaker 4: I have an IHOP, a Taco Bell.\nSpeaker 8: Outback Steakhouse and Applebee's. I. I thought maybe you got a confused with the. I have a restaurant is very popular with seniors so I thought maybe it was hip replacement restaurants. But how did those neighborhoods end up being categorized in the same as the same type as Councilman Espinosa's hot neighborhoods in Highland and Slim Lake, Jefferson Park\nSpeaker 8: , Stapleton Lowry, Cherry Creek Country Club. I'm stunned. Sure. And the reason I am just to be clear, Mr. President, reason I am is I'm concerned how these classifications will drive resources.\nSpeaker 3: Sure.\nSpeaker 8: Because being in that type may keep resources from going to those neighborhoods when in fact, maybe they ought to be going there.\nSpeaker 10: So to pieces, I will address the first piece. The neighborhood tapes were developed by Enterprise Community Partners based on almost 50 different factors. A majority of those were data points from the American Community Survey.\nSpeaker 8: And I did read through all of those in the appendix.\nSpeaker 10: I appreciate how much time council members have spent reading through the plan this week, and I want to say thank you. So there's in the appendix, there is a list of the different factors that went into those neighborhood clusters and typology analysis.\nSpeaker 10: It includes both what the the main theme is of the data as well as what the sources and the year that the data was collected most recently from. So the neighborhood clusters represent neighborhoods that scored similarly on those different factors.\nSpeaker 10: So the types were transit as well as housing, stock and availability, transportation, education, housing, stock, economic mobility like workforce and then health care were some of the themes of the different cluster analysis and the different data sources. The second piece, maybe I'll pause there.\nSpeaker 10: Does you have.\nSpeaker 8: No, no, no. What I would like to do then maybe is after, you know, in in the next week or so and see the actual number crunched up the crunched the numbers that led to this, it it's very confusing to me.\nSpeaker 10: Go ahead. I would be happy to spend more time. One of the things that we also outline in the last section of implementation, we recognized that these neighborhood typologies were developed as part of our analysis to look at what different neighborhoods of the city had, similar characteristics and those opportunity indicators.\nSpeaker 10: But we think that they need additional vetting, additional conversation. So we're proposing to look at some of the physical conditions on the ground, in addition to what we found from the neighborhood clusters, based on X data, as well as have continued conversations about what opportunity looks like for these different areas and how to focus our investments.\nSpeaker 10: So, yeah.\nSpeaker 8: I'm sorry, can you say that this categorization, this ranking or placing them in different categories will or will not drive or block resources from going to those areas?\nSpeaker 10: I think it will inform our investments, but I think there's opportunity for additional conversation about what those neighborhoods look like and what the.\nSpeaker 8: Last question is on the live Denver program. The voucher of the voucher to make up the difference between the the of the rents that a tenant might be able to pay versus what the market rate is in vacant units.\nSpeaker 8: I think the theory of the market is that if a landlord has a lot of units that are vacant, he's asking too much. And I'm concerned and I wonder what the discussion was in the group. I'm concerned that by agreeing to pay the difference between what a tenant who needs an affordable unit can pay versus what we\nSpeaker 8: will backfill. Does not provide any incentive for a landlord to lower rents that were only feeding a spiral. And I'm very concerned about that. So what is. I know that this program is not quite in place yet. And tell me what your thinking is on on that phenomenon.\nSpeaker 10: Sure. I will take a first stab at the answer to that. Certainly. Eric Sullivan, who is the director of the Office of Hope, has worked on this project for a long time and might have some additional information to provide as part of this.\nSpeaker 10: But as as part of an RFQ that we released in November of 2017, we asked interested property owners who were interested in responding to the RFQ to provide their market rent, what they were charging, as well as the concessions that they were offering, for example, two months free rent.\nSpeaker 10: And so we took in as part of the RFQ responses, both that market rent as well as the concessions. And part of the analysis that the staff in the city, as well as our partners in DOJ have been undergoing, is to look at what we're calling a reasonable market rent comparison, looking at what was provided as a\nSpeaker 10: response to the RFQ, to other properties in the area that are comparable in size and location and and type of unit to ultimately come up with a reasonable market rent for the particular units that responded to the RFQ.\nSpeaker 10: As we finalize the parameters of the program, there would be an RFP that is released to finalize what that reasonable market rent is for the particular units. But that's some of how we are determining what the reasonable rent is for the properties that responded to the RFQ for this program.\nSpeaker 4: All right. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Ortega. Turn your mike on speaker resolve.\nSpeaker 6: Laura, I have a few questions for you. So let me first start by just laying out a couple of things that when you come back to do the review of the one year action plan, I'd like to make sure are contained within that.\nSpeaker 6: So for example, the live program we had talked about this at the last housing meeting when the plan came through, a number of us asked to see it mapped on where these units are at by district. How many are we doing in total and where are they?\nSpeaker 6: So that's one issue. I would like you to address. What the expectation is on the existing, the existence and the ongoing role of the Housing Advisory Committee. So you can either speak to that tonight or, you know, when this comes back to us, I would think that there's been some thought put in to the role and the\nSpeaker 6: importance that the broad and diverse group of stakeholders have given to the city. And I think, you know, knowing what the city's commitment to that is is really important. I think they play a vital role in helping look at the annual priorities and making sure that we are meeting not only the spirit, but the intent of the\nSpeaker 6: , you know, the five year plan in meeting those AMI thresholds. So I would like to see how. The in the one year action plan, how 20 $17 in 20 $18 are in fact meeting those RMI goals set. I would also like to know.\nSpeaker 6: On the. Renter protections, what those specifically entail. I know we had Helen Taylor talk about the program that is currently funded, the Temporary Rental Assistance and Utility Program. Are we continuing that? What are some of the others? You know, city council, for example, put funds into addressing legal issues with evictions and whatnot.\nSpeaker 6: So is this something that our housing fund is going to be providing some dollars to? So that's another one you can speak to in that when you bring that back. This one's really important, the investments that are being made.\nSpeaker 6: The plan speaks over and over to investments that the city is going to make, but it doesn't clarify the commitment to permanent affordability. So the live program, it's a temporary program. It's not creating permanent units. It's utilizing existing permanent units.\nSpeaker 6: And I don't have a problem with the concept, but where we know we need more units in this city, I don't want to see us obligate all of this money to some things where we're not able to address the creation of more affordable units in this city.\nSpeaker 6: Go on. Got a couple more here, Mr. President. Okay. If I may, I think it's important to know. Of the obligations, how much of that being committed to the various programs? How much is going to the community land trust?\nSpeaker 6: How much is going to the live program? I tried to get information on how much we've obligated to the citywide community land trust and have not been able to get that information from from anyone. So I think when that comes back to council with the one year action plan, I want to know that I would think some\nSpeaker 6: of my colleagues would want to know that as well. And, you know, somebody raised the question about, you know, do we really have a supply problem or mention that we have a supply problem? But if we have apartment buildings or, you know, apartment owners offering a couple of months free rent, that says to me that it's not\nSpeaker 6: necessarily a supply problem, it's an affordability problem. And so I think understanding that will be really important in terms of, you know. Do we need to keep building more units? Like I said before, we've never had more housing units in this city being built than we do today.\nSpeaker 6: The problem is they're at a price point that the average person cannot afford. So what are we doing to bring that price point down to address the needs and demands of people that are trying to stay in this city?\nSpeaker 6: So currently, I just.\nSpeaker 0: Want to make sure there's a question in that.\nSpeaker 6: One. Well, it's asking for that information as part of that.\nSpeaker 0: So is that is that a vacancy rate? Question is I just want to be clear.\nSpeaker 6: It's it's so so it's trying to answer the question, do we have a supply problem or do we have, you know, an affordability prognosis? You got that? Okay. Two last ones. Brad. Raised a question about the funding and I wanted to ask Brendan if you could talk about the.\nSpeaker 6: Analysis that we've done about bonding and whether or not there are other city resources programs that we're looking at to add more money. You know, this was a priority in city council's retreat. And we we all feel that pressure that families experience every day.\nSpeaker 6: And so what are those various tools that we're looking at to add more resources?\nSpeaker 3: So, Councilwoman, on your first question, we're going to be in committee on March 7th talking about the the multiyear obligation type structure that all in Denver is. That's all in Denver is proposed. Councilwoman Kennish has been very involved in that.\nSpeaker 3: We've been working through her and her office, so we'll will be in committee on that day. The second is, I think this has been a leading priority for city council over no less than five years at this point in time.\nSpeaker 3: And I think every year is a deliberative budget process. We've we've looked to add funds this past year. We worked a lot.\nSpeaker 9: On adding funds that.\nSpeaker 3: Backfilled the linkage fee when it underperformed.\nSpeaker 9: We also transacted, you'll remember, the Tsotsi settlement. We transacted dollars.\nSpeaker 3: Into that as well. So we're always kind of looking for those opportunities as they come around. And we continue to do so both during the budget process as well as when we see, you know, an opportunity like \u00d6tzi come through.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thank you. The last one is on the ADOS. And just a question, Laura. When you all come back, I think it's important to hear what the thinking is on. ADOS be available as permanent housing. If they all are allowed to be turned into short term rental, then we are not solving our housing problem, we're just exacerbating\nSpeaker 6: it. I think we did that when we created and allowed adus. That's my personal opinion. I think that so there's somewhere in the ballpark of 3000 units that are currently not available, as you know, permanent rental housing for folks because they're utilized as short term housing.\nSpeaker 6: So I think we need to look very seriously at how we allow those ADU use to be. And again, to Renee Martinez, to Stones point, how we prioritize that. Okay. And the very last one I'm sorry, Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 0: We got a lot of folks. Okay. Thank you. Come on. Thank you. All right, Councilwoman. I mean, Councilman Neal. Sorry about that, Ken.\nSpeaker 5: Brenda, you know the question. Younger tie ins. Councilwoman Ortega's question. But I it's going to be one question, Brenda, on the when you come to committee. You know, I was very impressed with the options that Brad presented tonight.\nSpeaker 5: You know, can you do an evaluation on each one of those options to the committee to talk about the pluses and minuses of each one of those options so council can understand clearly what the city's position is on those and what your opinion is on that?\nSpeaker 3: Sure, sure. We had some PowerPoint slides from the last time we were in committee. I'll make sure that you get a copy of those two that at least outline pros and cons for each of the proposals.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, we're covering each one of the four options that he gave tonight.\nSpeaker 3: There are some additional options that are in front of us. So I have to run some additional numbers, but we'll get those to you. That'll be great.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilman. Councilman Lopez.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. President. I don't know. Who I think is Laura, if you can push the microphone. I wanted to ask a question and this is just a follow up regarding land trusts right now, there's different kind of land trusts.\nSpeaker 3: And I know folks in the community have talked a little bit about the need for community driven land trusts, right? Like neighborhood owned land trusts. So more of that kind of co-op type of land trust. What has been I mean, you talked a little bit about it in committee in terms of the process.\nSpeaker 3: What's the commitment in the housing plan to that? And specifically, do we actually talk about, I mean, differentiate the types of land trusts and put our chips in on a and specifically on a neighborhood land trust? And what's our commitment to neighborhood land trust?\nSpeaker 10: So the housing plan outlines exploration of community land trusts. I will note that we do have a couple of land trust that do operate in the city. We had heard from the Urban Land Conservancy as well as the Colorado Community Land Trust.\nSpeaker 10: But as part of the exploration of land trust, the language in the plan outlines a couple of factors for consideration. And community stewardship is one of those factors.\nSpeaker 3: In community stewardship, meaning that it's.\nSpeaker 10: Owned with how the and how the land trust is informed by community participation. I think that exploration of land trust will involve a lot of those conversations about what exactly the right model looks like in an individual neighborhood.\nSpeaker 10: But that's part of what's outlined in that in the plan for exploration and something that we're working on in 18.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And Renee, if you can come to the microphone when we're talking about ideas and we're talking about the West Denver Plus, I really want you to evaluate something or just explain to us a little bit more in depth and what that can be.\nSpeaker 3: I've asked this question of you. We both talked about this because this is happening throughout the neighborhoods and that is people are already converting their garages even in non edu zone districts. Right. We've seen CPD make exceptions for artists who were having nonconforming uses.\nSpeaker 3: Can you talk a little bit about kind of the program and how it would address? A lot of people think I mean, a lot of people know the reality of building you need to use. It's pretty expensive. It's about $65,000 at a very minimum.\nSpeaker 3: Right. Can you talk a little bit about the plan to approach some of the garage conversions, if that is indeed a possibility?\nSpeaker 11: Yep. So will be the first component of West Timber single family plus meaning homeowners where they are. And so it's a bit of a triage to to make sure their mortgage is good and their home needs doesn't need any critical repairs.\nSpeaker 11: Part of that would be around looking at a garage and assessing, you know, sort of the needs of the family, what their equity is, what their opportunities are. 80 you construction is expensive. We just did a market review with a few builders and a 650 square foot unit.\nSpeaker 11: Pulling together numbers from a number of homeowners who've just built to use in a number of builders. The average price is $250,000 for a 650 square foot unit. And it's it's very expensive. There are a lot of as there should be, building code requirements that in some cases prevent a garage from being converted.\nSpeaker 11: So our primary approach to that situation is working closely with a very valued partner, Habitat for Humanity, and we'll be building the units for the 82 program of the West Denver Single Family Plus, and through a number of efforts, including valuing engineering, creativity, their experience, the same size unit 650 square feet will cost approximately at this time\nSpeaker 11: 125,000. So half of the market rate. Part of that is to pull down that price to an attainable, very controlled way of developing that unit, but specifically converting a garage. Um, is going to be dependent on a number of factors.\nSpeaker 11: And in most cases, I have to say, probably not very likely.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And if I just may ask Laura, one just follow up question to that conversation. Thank you. That's okay, Mr. President. Laura, it is expensive, even fixing garages that could be used as a to use and doing that require if it's not.\nSpeaker 3: The challenge with with with money or capital to borrow against to be able to do that. Sometimes the challenges with CPD. And getting them to recognize that this you know, a lot of these, you know, don't perhaps need to be so stringently enforced in terms of some of the regs with already existing uses.\nSpeaker 3: Do we have an approach with CPD to identify that kind of challenge? I mean, I use the the artists that were in non-conforming abodes, so to speak, of spaces as an example of CPD moving to help those folks that were there.\nSpeaker 3: Do you is there anything in the plan or any goal that that you've you've encountered in making sure that that same courtesy can be extended for. Things like this.\nSpeaker 10: So I will acknowledge that the housing plan does include some land use recommendations, including expanding the opportunity to construct to use in the legislative and regulatory section. On that particular question about the conversion of enforcement is something that I haven't personally talked to CPD Sarah Showalter as hear from CPD, although on the planning side, if you have\nSpeaker 10: anything to add, please feel free. Otherwise I can take that back to the CPD team and ask for some further analysis.\nSpeaker 3: If you want to make.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. I didn't.\nSpeaker 0: Say it. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening.\nSpeaker 11: Sarah Showalter with Community.\nSpeaker 1: Planning Development. So don't have that much to add because we haven't talked about it at all. But I think it's a great point and you give a great example of what we are, you know, that that way of thinking for the artists spaces.\nSpeaker 10: So it's a great idea.\nSpeaker 1: I think we definitely take it back. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you and thank you, Mike. My only point, Mr. President, is just the artists. We extend that courtesy for folks and that with our success, we should probably be doing the same thing for folks that already have ideas.\nSpeaker 3: Unbeknownst to them, it was illegal from God's. Please.\nSpeaker 0: Dr. Sussman.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. President. Ren\u00e9, I have a question for you. I was I was very intrigued with the kind of study you did about AIDS and stars and and all the nuances that, you know, it might mean. And one of our big decisions as we were working on stars or one of our big rationales was that for\nSpeaker 1: some families and the reason why we require that they be primary housing was that some families could use an SDR in order to meet a mortgage. But we didn't have third real good third party data about that. We had it from the from the Airbnb and we had it from some of ours.\nSpeaker 1: Is there data that you were able to look at that compared that value, that good value? Yes. Help me meet my mortgage if I suppose I buy a house that already has an ADU versus. The one that you all were concerned about, that under this program you can't use an SDR because of the you already have to\nSpeaker 1: have enough money to have a mortgage in order to get the home that has the adu. I would love to have, if you have it, the data that passed that out, because that's that is an important nuance.\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. And unfortunately, I have to say, we don't have the data. That is a true rental analysis of the rents being achieved with short term rentals versus long term rentals. Part of the problem with studying its use, you know, dependent on any variable is just there's not that many to study in the city and that's driver.\nSpeaker 11: That's true in particular of documented areas. Last study I looked at there was three in all of us, Denver, that were permitted. So there's a real lack of data. So that's why we're looking to other cities. We know that anecdotally, some of the reasons that are pushing families to do the to use the cost.\nSpeaker 11: Right. Um and so we've heard anecdotally again that. Do you see at the cost that this ended up creating in the time that it took in the unforeseen variables? We pretty much like have to run it at the absolute best return that we can on that.\nSpeaker 11: So that would be that. That's why after a lot of study, we really didn't hesitate to consider having a no short term rental requirement because of the cost that will be saving the homeowner. The work that's gone into reducing the cost of the ADU really does not put it into in the financing, won't be predicated on like\nSpeaker 11: the highest amount of rent that can be achieved. Yes, I see. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: I thought maybe you had found a secret cache of data that we couldn't find ourselves. But. But it makes sense. I mean, we you know, that it would be interesting to do some more research to see if I can find some.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much for your explanation.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, President Brooks.\nSpeaker 1: Laura, I have a question.\nSpeaker 6: For you about the American community survey data. And if you could explain for folks who are watching this at TV exactly how that data is collected.\nSpeaker 10: Sure I will make my best attempt, but it is the Census Bureau that collects that data every ten years. As you know, there's a full analysis and EC's data is collected annually as estimates as part of the in between the years of the ten year census.\nSpeaker 10: But I can certainly follow up with a more detailed analysis of what factors. Particular community. Well, let me let me clarify. I'm happy to follow up with more information about how data is collected and how we can make residents of where aware of those particular data points.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: It's via telephone that that that.\nSpeaker 1: Data is collected.\nSpeaker 10: I can follow up with that.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\nSpeaker 6: And so what is the plan? This is a point in time. What's the how is this going to get updated and communicated specifically to our constituents if there's changing conditions? Specifically with, you know, the maps, the type one through five.\nSpeaker 10: Sure. It's anticipated that we would update this map as new information is available and that would be contained in the annual action plans. So I believe it's 2015 is the majority of what this data is based on because it was the most the data was available across the most number of factors for the 2015 data, but that's\nSpeaker 10: what we anticipate in terms of updating information.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: And then, you know, once we vote on this tonight and, you know, thank you for all of the work and outreach and engagement. But once we vote on this tonight, city council will not then approve the action plans going forward.\nSpeaker 6: And so how will constituents and special interest groups and different stakeholders be able to, you know, continue to be engaged in the process if there's maybe not something that city council is voting on?\nSpeaker 10: Sure. We have a requirement in the ordinance that created the fund, as well as the committee, as well as the plan to have at least one public meeting annually. We are figuring out exactly what that might look like in coordination with planning, and we're also working with our advisory committee to refine what annual action planning looks like\nSpeaker 10: . So I can take the desire that I've heard tonight to have some updates on what annual action plans look like as they're being developed as well as as they're informed by this council. Back to our team as well as the advisory committee.\nSpeaker 6: Okay, great. My last question, and I'm not quite sure who to address this to, I'm sure it would be someone within OED. But regarding deed restricted properties. You know, it's my understanding in the past there was a kind of a blanket developer's agreement that that was filed to convey that those properties were indeed deed restricted.\nSpeaker 6: To my understanding, it hasn't been recorded on each individual property previously. And so are there conversations within OED or within.\nSpeaker 9: You know.\nSpeaker 6: The city to rectify or address that issue where someone might have a deed, restricted property and for whatever reason not know that there's income restrictions and there's limitations to them either buying or selling those properties.\nSpeaker 10: Sure. So I will at least answer the question. And if there's more information I can provide, I'd be happy to. Under the development agreements on major, large scale developments like Staples here in Green Valley Ranch, Lowery as well as under the inclusionary housing ordinance and rezoning agreements, we have more than 1200 units that have been produced that\nSpeaker 10: are for sale units. A majority of those units have an individual covenant on the property. But there are some filings in Green Valley Ranch where the covenant is on the filing and then the information about the affordability covenant is within the warranty deed, but the covenant sets over the entire filing.\nSpeaker 10: So that's a unique scenario. In Green Valley Ranch, the majority of our covenants are on the individual unit. So I will acknowledge that we are also working to educate our homeowners in that program about the requirements of their covenant.\nSpeaker 10: We just sent out a letter in the last couple of weeks to remind them just of the requirements of the covenant. So those are some of our outreach efforts, but I'd be happy to spend a little bit more time talking about that in more detail with you.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, I would love to talk more about that because the onus is put on the homeowner. And, you know, when you're going through mortgage paperwork and you're signing away, it might not be as clear as it needs to be, especially if you're looking to sell.\nSpeaker 6: And so I look forward.\nSpeaker 1: To having a little bit more robust conversation about that.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Thank you. Thank you, President Brooks.\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. One question for Will.\nSpeaker 9: Well. Is. The question is, is there a way to factor in? Is there a way to factor in the value of people living in affordable housing? And I imagine that if we did a bond, we would probably build denser housing sooner and to factor in the value of having people living in affordable housing for the better part\nSpeaker 9: of that ten years as opposed to incrementally over ten years. Let me just understand with that support the numbers that you were talking about. Right. So looking at a present value analysis of the value of somebody living in at affordable housing today or, say, a year from now versus eight years from now.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. I mean, there is a way of quantifying that. I can think of a number of ways you could quantify it. But I do have to give some thought to that. The reason why I say that is because you basically said, well, there's sort of the same amount at some point, but I think that there's some real\nSpeaker 9: value there to to our communities in the city to having higher concentrate, higher or higher numbers of affordable units in inclusive communities. It would I think maybe the more important question is how many more people could you house help by bringing money forward and having more money today than less money a year from now?\nSpeaker 9: Now. So I think it's something to think about. Sure.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Just a couple of quick questions. Laura, there's a comment about the restriction in affordability. Has there been an analysis done by OED on what cities have. What blanket did restrict your requirements. They've done citywide. So on our linkage fee it's a we have a 20 year on our ordinance.\nSpeaker 0: What have other cities done citywide?\nSpeaker 10: I will pull out the exact page, but we have conducted at least some initial analysis. There's a couple of examples in the housing plan that state in this section where we recommend enhancing the minimum requirement. Right now, it's the preservation ordinance that has a 20 year minimum affordability restriction for the receipt of city funding.\nSpeaker 10: The linkage fees also have a 20 year restriction. We looked at Boston, Seattle in a couple examples, and some of those are 40 years, 50 years, some of them use in perpetuity. But we would want to conduct some additional analysis and certainly have some policy conversations with our housing advisory committee as we inform that final number.\nSpeaker 0: So that seems like a change that the city council can make towards the preservation ordinance to a 4050 year based upon the hax recommendation.\nSpeaker 10: That is the place where the minimum affordability restriction exists in regulation.\nSpeaker 0: Great. And then just a quick question for Rene Martinez. So have you have you addressed and is this a yes or no? But have did you address tap fees? For a to use. Okay. She said, we hope to address taxes because I think that's a big, big, big issue.\nSpeaker 0: Do you. Yeah. Yeah. You want me? Yeah, go ahead.\nSpeaker 11: I actually would say to add on to that is that. The situation with taxis and water service is such that that will be an enrollment criteria because it's such a big variable in the development of an idea that a person's utilities and tap situation may actually influence if they're able to develop an idea or not.\nSpeaker 0: Do we know cities that have waived tap fees?\nSpeaker 11: We know cities that heavily permit fees but not found any.\nSpeaker 0: That waive tap fees.\nSpeaker 11: But we will we do intend to work at it at a larger level with the city versus just doing 30 units here and there.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you and thank you for your work on this. Okay. This concludes our questions. We're ready for comments. Public hearing of 111 is now closed. Comments for members of Council Councilwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. I first want to say a great big thank you to everybody who has been involved in putting this five year plan together. I think, you know, our city does this five year plan because it's required of HUD.\nSpeaker 6: But in this body of council used to approve the five year plan and somewhere along the lines, we got away from this body playing a role in in approving them. And I was pleased to see the mayor's office support this plan being adopted by council.\nSpeaker 6: So for members of the hack, which includes a broad spectrum of of interests and stakeholders to folks at OED finance, you've been very much part of these conversations. You know, this has involved communities around the city being able to weigh in.\nSpeaker 6: I think it's vitally important that we move forward, adopt this plan. But I'm anxiously looking forward to seeing the details in the one year action plan. That's really where we will see if we're meeting the benchmarks that are spelled out in the five year plan, you know, the emission levels that are sort of identified as target goals\nSpeaker 6: for the majority of the funds being spent, four 0 to 30. And, you know, looking we we don't have enough money to do everything unless we go figure out how to bring more money to the table so that we can address, you know, the issues, which is not all about production.\nSpeaker 6: That's important. Creating more affordable, permanent units in the city is important. But there are a variety of other things that this plan moves us towards doing, creating some renter protections for folks who find themselves paying ridiculous fees for, you know, being late one day, you name it.\nSpeaker 6: But this really, I think, hits the marks in terms of the key areas that we want to see happen in moving this plan forward. And again, we'll see the action plan come to us in March. I am anxious to see that we are committing to the community or neighborhood level community land trust and specifically for the yes\nSpeaker 6: neighborhoods. I know other neighborhoods are looking at this as well, but with gas, the thing that makes this a little different is Sea Dot has committed $2 million to those neighborhoods to address the housing that's being lost as a result of the I-70 project.\nSpeaker 6: So that money should go to those neighborhoods and they've got the, you know, appropriate. Expertize, working with them to ensure that those dollars are being spent in a way that maximizes the benefit to those communities. And so with that, I'm not going to continue more than just to say I appreciate the work that everybody has put into\nSpeaker 6: this, because this gets us moving forward. The real work starts as we continue to raise more dollars and, you know, really work towards trying to keep people in this city that want to stay in Denver. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 9: I want to thank the volunteers that worked on this over the course of this amount of time and the staff that led them and guided them through the process. But like several supporters that spoke tonight, they picked on the plan.\nSpeaker 9: So count me among them, the title of the of of the of the of the plan is called Housing and Inclusive Denver. And I think the operative word there is inclusive. And yet it only the word inclusive only comes up in one of the plan recommendations.\nSpeaker 9: And it's the fourth plan recommendation, and it's not even in Denver. And so that plan recommendation is pursue regional collaboration with partners across the metro Denver metro area to promote inclusive communities. I'm very big on the idea of inclusive communities, and maybe you argue that all of these other recommendations will do that.\nSpeaker 9: But I see a lot of sort of my concern originally when we passed this ordinance that created this whole thing, which was maintaining the status quo, a lot of the things recommendations sort of maintain the status quo, which we recognize aren't doing a really bang up job on inclusive community.\nSpeaker 9: So I get frustrated by that idea because it says recognizing that housing and affordability challenges, challenges do not start and stop at Denver's boundary boundaries. The city and its partnership should pursue regional partnerships, including with Denver's Regional Council government, to leverage funding and investment strategies to promote inclusive communities sort of outside of Denver.\nSpeaker 9: And this is the problem of displacement, is we need to be. I wish we had a strong recommendation to the to include to have inclusive inclusivity, to be a part of new construction. That idea is not strongly stated as a goal for Denver.\nSpeaker 9: Instead, that page that I just quoted emphasizes inclusivity on our surrounding communities. Not here, despite the title of the document Housing and Inclusive Denver. So among the recommendations is is a clear is clear direction that we should pursue inclusive housing as a norm.\nSpeaker 9: That should be among the recommendations, not an exception whether that is achieving achieved voluntarily or descriptively. And to do so, there needs to be an emphasis in this plan on lobbying in the state legislature for greater municipal autonomy regarding housing.\nSpeaker 9: We have strong limitations on what we can and can't do. You know, we went you know, Councilman Brooks went to great lengths to sort of get to that point with the incentives, which I think. Which Tim sort of spoke of.\nSpeaker 9: But that is a small. That is a small, small step towards this inclusivity idea. But we are encumbered, meaning that we are limited by the the rules and decisions that have been made at the state legislature on the degree of regulatory mandates that we can do towards this end.\nSpeaker 9: And it's not stated here. It's more like again. And maybe that's the aim, right? Which is this is just the permanent affordable housing fund and how we're supposed to divvy that up. But this is also replacing our housing plan, which does the does the bigger macroscopic picture.\nSpeaker 9: And so. That is my my my lone frustration. I appreciate the the the efforts towards sort of the my stated concerns that at committee and to Mr. Siegel's and Mr. Romero's comments get me the ballot initiative and you will see me relax my position on sunsetting.\nSpeaker 9: All right. So I want to see us. That's been my biggest frustration all along, is this is we've never done a big enough move on the affordable housing front at this time of incredible prosperity in crisis, in housing in Denver.\nSpeaker 9: And now is the time to sort of still the time to sort of capitalize on this thing, make moves that are that are more sustainable and sort of give us the ability to manage assets. None of that is I mean, that's all sort of granular.\nSpeaker 9: Hope to see it in the action plan. But, you know, I wish it were more strongly worded in this document, but I do still nonetheless appreciate the level of analysis and in the aspirational aspects of this document going forward.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Lopez.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. President. I also wanted to just thank you all for your work. I know there's a lot of work to create this housing plan. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for fighting for it way back when it's actually be completed.\nSpeaker 3: The housing plan was actually something that we talked about ten years ago without having an actual plan. And so I think being able to see it go through come to fruition is a big thing. However, a plan is a plan.\nSpeaker 3: This sits on the shelf unless there's action. And we all know that from this council to the people in this room, to the advocates, to the folks we know in the community that are that are screaming for help.\nSpeaker 3: Right. Especially when it comes to affordability. We have to make sure that that plan doesn't sit on some shelf and collect dust. We there are implementable changes. However, I do have a few comments. Rene, you're amazing. What your your work, your dedication in the West Side, especially with the 80 with the 80 use and the question of\nSpeaker 3: 80 use is something that shouldn't really, truly be revolutionary. This is something that we've always had the power to do in a lot of our areas. And in 2010, we kind of foresaw this as a good, happy medium because back then we weren't talking about affordability, we were just talking about survival and staying and keeping those homes\nSpeaker 3: right and keeping those that ownership of those homes. Unfortunately, there are just a few areas in Denver where it was the hardest hit in the whole country, both in Montebello and Green Valley Ranch and in the West Side, you had probably the some of the highest foreclosure rates in the country and it would go neck and neck\nSpeaker 3: with some of our other what the other cities. But the aid use has always been an option. And I think as a city we need to do whatever possible to help that come to fruition areas that we are okay with and focus in on.\nSpeaker 3: At least I know in the West I don't want to have to use we're down to do the legislative rezoning, give us staff time and let's get it done. That way these folks can actually take that next step.\nSpeaker 3: The other thing is, is a question that I think we have to address is, you know, there are a lot of folks that are living in garages and they're not necessarily living in garages as garages. They're living in garages as a way to use their just nonconforming uses.\nSpeaker 3: I visited a few of them and having conversations with CPD said, Well, we a counter and we've got to shut them down. Their nonconforming uses, and that is protocol. If there's a nonconforming use and you build something without permits, it gets shut down.\nSpeaker 3: What we've seen in some areas now with with artists, studios and a public support behind that, we can make it happen. We can social compassion, we can actually create steps for that. You don't necessarily have to be hard nosed.\nSpeaker 3: And I think the same approach has to be had with some of these ADA use in some of these areas. Right. So maybe it's the zoning first and then working with some of these property owners so they don't wanna have to fear coming the CBD, CBD saying oops, we actually built one, what do we do now?\nSpeaker 3: Right. So we have to address that on a case by case basis, but we have to have some policies that support that. The Community Land Trust. I hope we really mean neighborhood, community land trusts. There are different land trust that are out there.\nSpeaker 3: Some are more elaborate. Some are owned by organizations that have a lot of great track record. But there are folks who came in our chambers multiple times throughout our city saying we would like to see real grassroots residential on land trusts.\nSpeaker 3: I think that's a great idea. I think it's definitely something that we're not just exploring. But let's help. Let's help. Look at that. Let's help. Create may bring that to fruition as well to. The last thing is something that I always chime in on, especially when we're talking about affordability and affordability in our housing.\nSpeaker 3: It is well understood that we cannot do anything about rent control and our ability to actually do rent control. The state prohibits us from doing that. But there is an avenue. If the state were to allow local control of rental regulation.\nSpeaker 3: And we would actually have a viable option. And they're not going to do it overnight. And we know politically it's going to be a challenge, especially with the split house over there across the park. And highly unlikely. But that's only without our advocacy.\nSpeaker 3: If we really, truly believe in affordability in Denver and using all the tools that we can in the toolbox, then this is a big wrench that we need to be that is essential and doesn't have to look like rent control in other cities, but just the ability to be able to rest assured.\nSpeaker 3: One, you know, as we lay our heads at night from coming back from from council meetings to know that those cranes in Denver, all those cranes in Denver, if they're building housing now, we can count on policy that requires at least some level of affordability on every single one of those cranes, whether it's rental or whether they're\nSpeaker 3: for sale units. Without that tool, we are up a creek and we have to be real and we have to be strong with our advocacy because when we're silent. There's no action across there in that state capital. So, Mr. President, thank you so much for for me to speak.\nSpeaker 3: And thank you all for your hard work, Laura.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks, Councilman. Councilman Flynn.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. I first want to thank again everybody who did work on this for such a long time. And and but I share some of the concerns that Councilman Espinosa brought up, but also those I brought up during questioning.\nSpeaker 8: I in reading the plan, I felt that it. I agree with a lot of the goals and a lot of the recommendations, but to me it lacked a lot of specifics. And in the areas where I was specific, I felt that it missed the mark.\nSpeaker 8: And I'm speaking frankly about the characterizations of some of the neighborhoods in my own district that I thought were so far off in how they were typecast, that it may, as we heard, that it may end up either misdirecting or blocking the use of the resources from a fund into areas in my district that that could benefit\nSpeaker 8: from them. And that concerns me very much. And for that reason I have to cast a no vote, not out of any disrespect for the work that went in, but I but out of concern that as far as it's gotten right now, it may actually not do what it needs to do in my district.\nSpeaker 8: And so with that, Mr. President, I'll turn it back to you.\nSpeaker 0: All right, Councilman Flynn, and I'll turn it over to Councilman Cashman.\nSpeaker 4: Well, thank you, Mr. President. This is the housing inclusive. Denver is obviously it's not an action plan. It's an aspirational plan that commits to doing the legwork needed to get us to the to fine tune the actions that we need to achieve the broad range of recommendations in the plan.\nSpeaker 4: As I was reading along, I started to have concerns for specificity and realized what I was looking at. This plan looks at affordability for rentals and for sale units. It looks at a broad range of amenities. It looks at new builds preservation considers, new funding options, eviction assistance.\nSpeaker 4: It looks at tiny homes, land trusts, and A2 use at tools for affordability, extending covenants. It really touches all the bases that are important. And Councilman Flynn, I had my own concerns on a map to that. Had some on the face left questions for me.\nSpeaker 4: But I think the key is going to be in the action plans where where the rubber meets the road. I just think there's just been a tremendous amount of work done. And I really think this is a comprehensive package that will guide the conversation and do us a whole lot of good along the way.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm actually very pleased to support this this evening. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Cash from Councilman New.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mr. President. The play is very good, very comprehensive. And I'm very pleased with I think all three were involved in getting it developed. But to me, it's all about the money. You know, we we've talked about having enough revenue and we talked about the affordable housing program.\nSpeaker 5: We we worried about whether 15 million would be enough money. And and surely it isn't. Now, you know, the 2015 homeless plan identified 27,000 units for homelessness. You know this were identify. We talk now about 80,000 cost burdened citizens we have households we have and 5000 homeless on the street.\nSpeaker 5: So we've got an increasing need, not something that is decreasing. And so hopefully this plan will be the basis for improving that situation. And I look forward to bringing a really forward year analysis and I hope you'll work with all in Denver and come up with do a real thorough analysis of these four options because in rank\nSpeaker 5: them in terms of effectiveness on meeting our need. If this possible, I'd like to really see what it is that you come up with. I trust your judgment tremendously, and I know your team will help develop a good plan and see what those four options will be.\nSpeaker 5: So thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. New scene. Are there speakers? You know, I'll say this. I was critical of the plan because of a conversation we had around land trust early on and it looks like we've got that address. And so I'm I'm very excited to see the possibility of a land trust in Greece globally or Swansea.\nSpeaker 0: And so I'm excited. You know what Councilwoman Espinosa said it wasn't inclusive, but if you know the list that you just reading the plan and the list that Councilman Cashman just listed is every request that I had through my office to for the city to start addressing.\nSpeaker 0: And so I actually do feel like it's inclusive, is inclusive of grass roots, the grass tops leaders all over this city. You know, the the the deed restriction, the years of deed restriction needs to be dealt with in the preservation ordinance.\nSpeaker 0: And that's something that I'm going to be looking at and working on with members of council and figuring out with and communication with the hack and relationship with the hack of is 50 years, 40 years. What what is the right number based upon their advisement as well?\nSpeaker 0: And the last thing I'll say, just piggybacking off my Colfax brother, councilman knew is that it is all about the money. And if the city of Denver does not double the fun this year, this year, find the funds, this year we will be in trouble.\nSpeaker 0: And so I am not only am I predicting we are going to come together with the mayor's office to find those funds this year, I'm saying we have to for the good of this city. So thanks for everyone in the audience who stayed, who's been working.\nSpeaker 0: We appreciate you pushing. I think we've gotten to a place that we all can move forward. And this is how a city works. We fight a little bit, but we push a little bit and we come together with the vision.\nSpeaker 0: And I think this vision, for the first time in Denver's history, is going to move us to a good place. And so I want to lastly thank Councilman Ortega for putting this in the ordinance two years ago so that we can have this robust discussion.\nSpeaker 0: And with that. Madam Secretary, Raquel Ortega.\nSpeaker 2: Sussman Black. Clark Espinosa. Flynn, no. Gilmore, I. Herndon, I. Cashman. Lopez.\nSpeaker 9: All right.\nSpeaker 2: New. Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: I, um. Okay. We're good. Councilman Black's voting went down, but it went back up. All right. Calls voting in US.\nSpeaker 2: Results 11 eyes. One nay.\nSpeaker 0: 11 eyes, one nay. 111 has been adopted. That has been adopted. On Monday, March 19, 2018, Council will hold a required public hearing council bill 130 Changes on a classification for 680 Sheridan Boulevard and Villa Park and he protests against Council Bill 130 must be filed to Council Office no later than Monday, March 12th.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: I'll give Doug another round of applause for his lifetime of service. Congratulations. Okay. Great. I know we have a full agenda. We are going, like I mentioned before, to the item that most people are here for so we can get them on their way.\nSpeaker 0: And that is going to be item 34. So if I can have the clerk, please read.\nSpeaker 1: Item 34 Report from Economic and Property Development Financial Management Recommendation to enter into an exclusive negotiating agreement with Grand Prix Association of Long Beach for the production of an annual Grand Prix race and associated events District two.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. We're going to turn this over, I know, to Mr. West, it's a staff presentation. Mr. Mayor.\nSpeaker 4: Council members, some time ago, the council directed us to do an RFP to look at the opportunities to continue our relationship with the Grand Prix or potentially to a Formula One race. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our assistant city manager, Tom Modica, who will walk us through the process.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mr. West, Mr. Mayor and members of the city council, we're here tonight to really give the culmination of a tremendous amount of effort and work that has gone in over the the last year or actually a year or two to really look at the possibility of a street race in Long Beach and whether to go\nSpeaker 10: with an IndyCar type race or a Formula One type race. There's been a tremendous amount of analysis and review. And what we're going to do with you tonight is walk you through the process that we used and talk about the kind of three different groups that we use to analyze the proposals.\nSpeaker 10: You're going to hear directly from our outside experts, KPMG, who we brought on board as this is very technical analysis and we needed some outside assistance to make sure that we're fully understanding both of the proposals. We will review City Staff's recommendation and ask for some direction to take the next steps in negotiation.\nSpeaker 10: And then we also want to spend some time to talk about the future potential of the shoreline area. That's something that I believe the council has been very interested in and the mayor has been actually very involved in in leading this.\nSpeaker 10: I believe he wants to make some comments about kind of the future of the shoreline area and the next steps there. So getting into the presentation. I'm trying to get this to work. Pardon me? Here we go. So one to cover a little bit of background, what is Formula One and what is IndyCar?\nSpeaker 10: So Formula One is the highest class of single seat auto racing that is sanctioned by the FIA. Formula One are the fastest road course racing cars in the world. Europe is really the sport's traditional base and hosts about half of each year's races.\nSpeaker 10: But the scope, the sport's scope has expanded significantly and an increase in the number of Grand Prix is are held on other continents now. There were 21 Formula One races held in the 2016 season, and those include places like Austin, Texas, Melbourne, Australia, Singapore, Sochi, Russia, Montreal and Canada and many others.\nSpeaker 10: IndyCar was founded in 1994, and that's the IndyCar Series. And is is the sanctioning body for the Verizon IndyCar Series. The Grand Prix Association of Long Beach currently operates and promotes the existing IndyCar event for the Long Beach Grand Prix, and it has conducted three races and Long Beach for the past 42 years.\nSpeaker 10: The current Grand Prix event is the largest single street race in North America and the second largest event on the Verizon IndyCar Series calendar behind the Indy 500. ABC and NBC provide comprehensive, live, high definition television coverage of the Verizon IndyCar Series in the United States, and ESPN International has race coverage in over 212 countries of our\nSpeaker 10: race. The Verizon IndyCar Series has 17 events on the 2017 schedule, and that includes places like Long Beach, obviously Indianapolis, St Petersburg, Florida, Birmingham and Toronto. So I wanted to cover a little bit of the proposals in the RFP process and the process that we use to be arriving in front of you with the recommendation today.\nSpeaker 10: So we when directed by the Council, the Council really started this process asking staff to look into whether or not Formula One or Grant or IndyCar would be the best fit for a Long Beach. And so having given this direction, we went out and found some assistance in developing an RFP, and our RFP was released on October\nSpeaker 10: 5th, 2016. Responses originally due on the 28th, and we allowed some extra time based on the request of the proposers to November 28, 2016. Responses were received by two groups, the Grand Prix Associates of Long Beach and World Automotive Championship of California, or WACC.\nSpeaker 10: Subsequently, two rounds of clarification questions were issued. So we spent a number of months really looking at the data and the proposals and then had some additional questions and issued those questions on May 18th and June 12th to both groups so that both groups could respond to those questions.\nSpeaker 10: And then each proposal submitted clarifying questions. So we had the responses reviewed by three separate groups. One was our economic and property development staff and our management team. We also brought on some outside consulting expertize as this is a very technical field and we engaged KPMG Corporate Finance and they have a sub consultant apex circuit designed to\nSpeaker 10: really do that due diligence and analysis of the selection process. And then we also had a third group that was doing interviews with the proposals and that consisted of city staff and some outside specialists in economic development and special events.\nSpeaker 10: So the KPMG study really provided for that technical qualification. They're looking at technical qualifications, assessment of technical reasonableness and achievability. They're commenting on economic data, the assessment of financial capability and review of all the financial data that's submitted by both groups in assessment for commercial viability.\nSpeaker 10: They provided a very significant report and that is attached in in your packets for you to review. And also, we consulted with our public safety personnel, our public works and our planning staff on any of the changes or improvements to the city's infrastructure and public safety plans.\nSpeaker 10: We had an interview panel as well that consisted of staff from the Economic and Property Development Department, Public Works and Long Beach Police and Fire. We also brought on a board or a member from our city's Economic Development Commission to help provide some of that expertize.\nSpeaker 10: And then we also went outside to the city of Los Angeles mayor's office for special events to get an outside view as well. And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to our KPMG team for them to walk through a little bit of what they found.\nSpeaker 10: And then we will follow up with the city staff's recommendations.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. My name is Gareth Lee and I represent KPMG Corporate Finance. As noted, the city retained KPMG on April 18th to review proposals received for the city of Long Beach Grand Prix. Following the execution of our agreement.\nSpeaker 5: KPMG mobilized our team, including the International Expertize of Apex Circuit Design Ltd, in order to conduct our review of the proposals. I'm a I'm accompanied here today by Clive Bone, founder and Director of Apex Circuit Design Ltd. The scope of our assessment was to provide, review and comment to staff on the major area of areas of the\nSpeaker 5: proposals in line with the city's stated evaluation criteria presented in the request for proposals. Areas of focus included economic, financial and technical. As shown, the city stated nine evaluation criteria in the request for proposals, including things such as competence, experience, financial capacity and economic impact.\nSpeaker 5: Grand Prix Association of Long Beach, which I will refer to as GPA, was the incumbent provider. GPA indicated a continuance of a ten and a half day format, culminating in a three and a half day Grand Prix during round two of the clarifications.\nSpeaker 5: Both proposer teams were requested to confirm their ability to organize an event in 2019 which GPA was able to do. GPA indicated that they did not anticipate changes to the circuit footprint beyond adjustments for safety and identified that they have Coastal Commission approval for another four years.\nSpeaker 5: They have an existing FIA grade two license and demonstrated sanctioning body support in the form of a letter from the CEO of IndyCar with respect to potential economic impacts to the city. GPA included an estimate of $40 million in their proposal.\nSpeaker 5: However, they were unable to produce the report supporting that estimate, and we were therefore unable to substantiate that claim. GPA also provided a detailed schedule outlining set up time and take down times of 16 of 60 and 1717 days respectively.\nSpeaker 5: I will now hand over to Clive, who will summarize the Formula One proposal.\nSpeaker 4: Thanks, guys.\nSpeaker 5: So for Formula One, we had a submission from the World Automobile Championship of California, also known as WEC for Short, who are the bidding promoter for the Formula One race in Long Beach? The wax submission proposes a long weekend of activity, starting with free practice on Friday, qualifying on Saturday and the race on Sunday with supporting events\nSpeaker 5: for spectators throughout that weekend. It's interesting that White can't commit to an earlier first date than 2020, and I will explain later about why the circuit will need to be upgraded to host Formula One as the existing IndyCar circuit doesn't meet the minimum track length for Formula One.\nSpeaker 5: So two extensions have been proposed as upgrades, together with more general upgrade to meet the higher safety standards required. And no change to the existing infrastructure can commence without Coastal Commission approval. And we don't believe that work have yet opened a dialog with the Coastal Commission, a process we understand can take two years.\nSpeaker 5: Formula One is the highest level of motorsport sanctioned by the FIA, with the international sanctioning body, a French named entity translating roughly to the International Automotive Federation. And the circuit will need to accommodate an FIA Grade one standard.\nSpeaker 5: Formula One cars are mandated to run on circuits which have smoother, flatter surfaces, have more energy absorption in their barrier systems, and are engineered to a higher standard than for a grade two standard, which is the current specification for Long Beach.\nSpeaker 5: The process of homologation or being issued with a circuit license by the FIA starts with a full design submission to the FIA Circuits and Safety Commission followed, following which the FIA design approval is usually achieved in a few months and the actual circuit license is only ever issued once the upgraded facility is complete and ready to host\nSpeaker 5: an event. The sanctioning process with the FIA can only commence once there's a contracted event in place with the city of Long Beach. Concurrent with the design approval process with the FIA, then the World Motorsport Council will need to approve the event for the following year's calendar.\nSpeaker 5: Hence the claimed inability to achieve an event sooner than 2020. Somewhere in all of this, too, would be the negotiations with the commercial rights holders for Formula One. Neither bidder provided any economic impact analysis to review, and so we can't substantiate the $100 million claim for economic benefit to the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 5: Lastly, the submission proposed a quicker set up and teardown schedule than the current program, which is interesting, but probably the result of having a permanent pit structure in place in their proposal. I'll just give you a little bit of a synopsis of the tracks that are proposed.\nSpeaker 5: I presume that most here are familiar with the existing IndyCar layout, but I'll summarize it briefly. It's entirely temporary in terms of setup. The pit and paddock complex are based in and around the elephant parking lot. The team set themselves up in here and control the race from here.\nSpeaker 5: The pit lane, which provides a safe mechanism for access to and from the circuit, uses the northern carriageway of the east side of Shoreline Drive, a road, by the way, made of a concrete slab, something I'm going to refer to later.\nSpeaker 5: The pit lane joins the track, which uses the southern carriageway, a short line drive heading west and turn one. The Toyota turn is a 90 degree left hander opposite the Pike outlets and starts a low speed sequence past the Aquarium of the Pacific.\nSpeaker 5: Around the aquarium garage and back onto Shoreline Drive at turn five, a small section of track runs in the opposite direction on the approach to turn six, which is a 90 degree left turn onto Pine Avenue, a very bumpy and cracked concrete surface, and then turn eight takes the track along seaside way, which by the way is\nSpeaker 5: one of the better sections of Resurface Road before the track, then peels across the elephant parking lot and rejoins Shoreline Drive the hairpin at turn 11 on Shoreline Drive is the final turn before the run to the finish line opposite the pit lane.\nSpeaker 5: By comparison. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the submission made by Wack to show their proposed track layout. Norm in this industry would be to submit a 3D computer aided design submission. Even at this early stage in proceedings. So to assist you in understanding our interpretation of their sketch, a handwritten sketch, and the written submission from Wack, we\nSpeaker 5: prepared this. The track is notionally the same as that used by IndyCar, but to achieve the additional lengthier extensions at each end of Shoreline Drive. So Turn five is now a left hander running west and you hairpin is established after 65 yards before the Queensway overpass and then follows the existing last until the track rejoined Shoreline Drive\nSpeaker 5: . After crossing the 11 parking lot, a new hairpin near Iteration Boulevard intersection is required, resulting in a net increase in track length to just over the mandated minimum of two miles wack identified certain upgrades, namely a fixed pit structure which might be permanent or semi-permanent, similar to that used in the Singapore Marina Bay Circuit or Albert Park\nSpeaker 5: in Australia. This pit structure is proposed to be 520 feet in length and 40 feet in depth, which would make it the smallest on the F1 calendar. The track would be widened on the approach to and into aquarium wear at turn one.\nSpeaker 5: And of course the two new corners which have already been described back, acknowledge that some road improvements are required. And I'd like to draw attention to the fact that all of the track on Shoreline Drive and on Pine Avenue will require re-engineering on one hand, you back to Catholic.\nSpeaker 5: I can. So in summary, GPI has confirmed its ability to conduct race in 2019 with no changes to the existing format and existing permits and licenses in place. However, it is noted that GPA has been unable to confirm economic impacts associated with the event, while on the other hand has indicated that they are unable to organize events\nSpeaker 5: in 2019 and based on the information reviewed are scheduled to the achievement of permitting and approvals was not made clear and presents additional risk for the implementation of this option. In addition, the city's financial liability under this proposal is also not clear.\nSpeaker 7: While materials were provided and.\nSpeaker 5: Reviewed indicating the benefits of Formula One on other regions and economic impact assessments specific to the city of Long Beach was not made available. Lastly, the work proposal includes structures that may limit long term redevelopment and impact city parking spaces in the area.\nSpeaker 10: So we wanted to now review and now that you've heard some of the analysis that your proposals city staff is recommending that the Council give us direction to begin negotiations with the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach, and we wanted to review some of the proposed lease terms with you.\nSpeaker 10: I want to be clear, you're not approving a lease tonight. You were essentially giving staff direction to go and negotiate. And we wanted to give you a sense of the areas that we were going to be working on.\nSpeaker 10: We will work on those planning council direction and then come back to you with an actual one agreement that will be negotiated and ready to be approved. And so those proposed lease terms are in your packing, on the screen and on briefly go over some of those.\nSpeaker 10: It would be a five year initial term with a15 year option at the city's option to extend the term. We would require that all physical improvements to the track be the responsibility of the promoter. There would be a minimum of at least 14 cars to participate in the race, and that race would occur in April unless unless\nSpeaker 10: otherwise authorized. The promoter will be required to submit a schedule of all the planned races for events for race week which the city will approve. We are also going to be asking the promoter to essentially match the WACC proposal as much as possible to reduce the current set down and take the set up and take down times\nSpeaker 10: . And we would negotiate what that is and of course make sure that it's a time that is also abides by all the safety requirements in addition to reducing that sit down, set up and take down time. One of the things we do want to add is a requirement that the promoter would take responsibility to alleviate some of\nSpeaker 10: the negative physical impacts that we've seen. Those are things like markings on our streets. Your city staff has spent a lot of time over the past year trying to test a number of different solutions to get those marks off the street.\nSpeaker 10: And we believe we are successful and have now identified one that can safely remove them. So we'll be including that into the agreement. We want the parties to agree on a promotional package to be provided to the city.\nSpeaker 10: This is to help with our economic development efforts. We also want to ensure that we have an outreach program for disadvantaged youth so that they can participate in in the Grand Prix as well. The promoter will pay a race fee, administrative cost reimbursement and all extraordinary costs, reimbursements and lost revenues to the city so that the city\nSpeaker 10: is not financially on the hook for anything. And we would have no responsibility as a city for out-of-pocket expenses associated with the race. And then finally, one of the things that did come to light during this process is we need some better data on our economics that there is.\nSpeaker 10: Both parties really didn't have the type of data we were looking for, for economics. And so we'd be requiring Grand Prix Association of Long Beach to provide an economic impact study that the city would work with them on, on finding a qualified vendor, and then periodically update that so that we have some some real data on what\nSpeaker 10: the economic impacts would be. So the next steps we're asking for your direction to execute and into an exclusive negotiating agreement for up to 90 days. We hope to be back within 90 days. We would have the ability to have 230 day extensions for any unforeseen circumstances.\nSpeaker 10: We would negotiate the terms and others, the terms I just described as well as some others, and bring all that back to you for final approval. And with that, I believe the mayor had wanted to have a little bit of a discussion about some of the kind of future potential of this area and how this fits in\nSpeaker 10: with the Grand Prix.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Murdoch. And I want to just begin, of course, by thanking staff for their extensive review. And I also want to thank I know the council has been very involved in ensuring that this was a process that was open and ensuring that it was also a process that was fair, but one that also, I think\nSpeaker 0: , address some of the needs of the of the city, whether it was around ensuring that we had strong infrastructure and some of the the needs of the business community as well. And so I do want to thank the Grand Prix Association or the folks from F1 that were also involved and everyone that contributed to the process.\nSpeaker 0: I wanted to just also mention a few things. I think it's important to talk as we go into this process and as if the council moves forward tonight and begin negotiations with the Grand Prix Association. There's also been some conversation around the actual site itself.\nSpeaker 0: And so I just want to say a few brief notes about what is happening when it comes to this this site. So we know that the Grand Prix, of course, also and the track of the Grand Prix is also built around a very large parcel of land that is in the downtown area.\nSpeaker 0: The lot is sometimes called the elephant lot. It's highly used not just by the Grand Prix for that for the event, but of course we know is used extensively by the CVB for numerous events for parking, it's used for events, it's used for Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Pride uses it for many of their events. So it is a pretty active staging ground for for many of the events that happen in the city of Long Beach. At the same time, it's also an underdeveloped site as well.\nSpeaker 0: And so one of the things that I was I just want to make sure folks know is that over the course of the next few months, I had I've already been and already engage with Councilwoman Pearce as well as the District two team and city staff.\nSpeaker 0: But we will be launching a visioning process for the long term use of that site and the long term development of that site as well. This will also concur concurrently as the city begins to redo the PD six zoning zone.\nSpeaker 0: So for those that aren't aware with our our zoning jargon, that part of the city is actually called the zoning. A name is PD six and it needs also an update for zoning. And that's since we did the downtown plan many years ago.\nSpeaker 0: But PD six or basically south of Ocean was not done. And so there are many partners at the table from our residential community to the Dolby to the CVB and the Grand Prix and others that need to be at the table as part of that process, as well as, of course, the business community and the businesses that\nSpeaker 0: are there along the coast. This is a process and the visioning process. I will also say there will be a lot of interested folks involved. I have assured those who are involved, including those with our current race, that the Grand Prix would be and will be an important player and partner in any discussion about the future of\nSpeaker 0: the site, as would be the other partners like Long Beach Pride and others that use that site for large events. And so I do want to thank everyone that's been involved in that. And I just let you all know that in the course of the next few months, you will be hearing a lot about the beginning early\nSpeaker 0: stages, which is essentially visioning process to begin having a citywide conversation long term about what we do with the incredible amount of land that is there along the coast of the city. And so I wanted to say that because we've had a lot of questions about that, and I look forward to working, of course, with Councilwoman Pierce\nSpeaker 0: and the city on that process. And so with that, I'm going to turn this over to the the maker of the motion and the seconder. And then if there is an objection, I'm going to go to public comment or I can go through the whole council and then do public comment.\nSpeaker 0: It's really up to when we do public comment first. Okay. So why don't we go ahead and go and do public comment on this is public comment for the Grand Prix and for and for this contract. And then we'll come back to Councilwoman Pearce.\nSpeaker 0: So let me begin. I'm going to invite first I know that there was a request from from Jim to come up and say a few words first. So if Jim, you could please come up and then we'll do begin public comment.\nSpeaker 4: But thank you very much, Mayor Garcia, members of the city council, city staff. You know, 43 years ago, a unique proposal came before the city. City then was known primarily as a Navy town and it was looking for a way to increase its identity.\nSpeaker 4: And Long Beach, as the Grand Prix Association was looking for a place to stage a race, a lot of transpired. In the interim. Look at the city now. Dynamic, vibrant, growing. And the Grand Prix Association, too, has grown over those years.\nSpeaker 4: It has become the largest street race in the world and we're very proud of that fact and it has contributed immensely to the recognition of the city. We are over 183,000 people come to last year's event. Almost 2.5 million people watch the race on national television, not including the international component.\nSpeaker 4: And we've had a number of accolades from that. The USA Today poll showed that Long Beach Grand Prix event was one of the top ten races in the world. The Washington Post indicated that this was the gold standard of street racing in America, and the L.A. Times and the local press Telegram have also talked about the marketing\nSpeaker 4: capabilities of the event. But I wanted to take a moment tonight to talk to you about where we see the vision going of this unique partnership into the future. And it really pertains to something that's really critical to us, and that is something we call commitment, because that is really what we represent here in terms of our\nSpeaker 4: relationship with the city. And for us, the commitment starts at the top. It starts with our ownership. Kevin Keller, Calvin and Jerry Foresight bought this company in 2005. They've been significant supporters of this event and of our company over the years.\nSpeaker 4: In fact, Kevin has actually flown in from Florida tonight to be here. And I wanted to take a moment to recognize Kevin Carl Coleman, one of the owners of the Grand Prix. Thank you very much. Thank you to you and Gerry for your continued support.\nSpeaker 4: It's really important. And the city has in this possession a commitment from Mark Miles, who's the CEO of the Verizon IndyCar Series, to continue conducting their race here as a part of our weekend for as long as we have an agreement between the city and ourselves.\nSpeaker 4: And we really could have made this event happen if it wasn't for the extremely capable staff that we have at the Long Beach Grand Prix. They have a tremendous amount of experience. Some of them have been with us 20 years, 30 years, one of them who's actually been with us for 40 years, and they know how to\nSpeaker 4: put these events together and do them in a manner that makes it a really a for first rate operation. I'd like to take a moment to ask our staff to stand up and be recognized. There a great group.\nSpeaker 4: It's my privilege to be able to work with them every year. And speaking of commitment, I know that there's a number of activities that take place in this town that we are committed to continuing as we go forward.\nSpeaker 4: Like we talked about the reimbursement of the city expenses and making sure that there were no city expenditures involved in that. And we will continue to do that. We also have made a very significant effort to keep this event as affordable as possible.\nSpeaker 0: And Jim, we've got a wrap we're going to wrap it up some time. Okay. Great.\nSpeaker 4: If you take a look at our ticket prices, they're very, very reasonable. And we also have the opportunity for children 12 and under to come in for free, which is really important for us. And we work with the CVB in terms of filling hotel rooms and also working with the stakeholders in the downtown area.\nSpeaker 4: But there's one other point that I think is really important to remember, and that is this is a city event. We are part of the fabric of this community. And as such, it's really important for us to be involved in the activities in this in this region.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks so much, Jim. So we went over the 3 minutes. I got to keep the 3 minutes to everybody.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Okay. Just to wrap up. Go ahead. Let me let me just let me just say that in concluding this really important for us, that we make the commitment. Our commitment is that we will continue to operate a very fan friendly, family oriented festival here in this town.\nSpeaker 4: That's our commitment to you and to all the residents that will bring them an event that they will be very proud of. And we're delighted to be able to continue that relationship for years to come.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks so much. Thanks so much, Jim. Appreciate it. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Mayor Garcia, Vice Mayor Richardson and honorable members.\nSpeaker 6: Of the city council. Good evening. My name is Peter Santillan.\nSpeaker 4: I'm the business manager, Secretary-Treasurer of Labors Local 1309. And with me tonight, we have several of our members, former employees of the Grand Prix. If I can ask you to stand and be recognized as well. And they're here today in support of the Grand Prix of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 4: A lot of these members have worked, are still working, worked on the Grand Prix this year. We work putting the track together and I think we do a great job. One of the things that I'm really happy about in partnering with the Grand Prix of Long Beach is the safety aspect that they follow that they stick to\nSpeaker 4: . We've been blessed and I mean, knock on wood, we've never had an incident, a situation where anybody's got injured. The track is put together again by them. And to my knowledge, since I've been business manager in 2012, everything has gone well.\nSpeaker 4: Today I want to, along with the members of Local.\nSpeaker 6: 13 or nine.\nSpeaker 4: Come before you and encourage you to move on the agenda as recommended by staff. We've we've had a long term working relationship with the Grand Prix of Long Beach. They've been a good partner. They take care of their members or of our members, their employees.\nSpeaker 4: The short period of time has been pointed out. 60 days set up, 15, 20 days to take it down gives a lot of our members the ability to earn insurance for their families, earn the pension credits that they need, especially during that first and second quarter when it used to rain in California, although we did have a\nSpeaker 4: lot of rain this year. But it bridges that gap in that those first few months of the year. So I know there's a lot of people behind me and I'm a wrap it up. I encourage you to to move and move this process along and approve the recommendation of city staff.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Council. I'm sorry. Next speaker. Hello. Thank you for.\nSpeaker 5: Allowing me the opportunity to speak. Honorable Council and Mayor Garcia. I guess with these couple of minutes, I kind of just really wanted to confirm what I kind of just seen. The gentleman who spoke about two spots before me.\nSpeaker 5: I think he seemed to indicate that there would be kind of no liability from the city of Long Beach if this moved forward as as planned. However, the previous visuals that I just seen, it kind of indicated that there would be a, quote unquote, severe financial liability and an unknown economic impact.\nSpeaker 5: Was I correct with with what I seen on the screen previously.\nSpeaker 0: Complete your comment and then I'll have I'll clarify that.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. I'll just take that as a yes. So that's a little bit concerning for me, most of which you'll find out.\nSpeaker 7: A little bit later when I give my pro-free market spiel.\nSpeaker 5: Regarding rent control.\nSpeaker 7: But I just want the public of.\nSpeaker 5: Long Beach to kind of be aware of what's happening. We kind of.\nSpeaker 6: Have just literally a council that will pass everything.\nSpeaker 5: On a nine no decision indicating that there's no that they're unified in all their decisions.\nSpeaker 0: Which is concerning and kind of.\nSpeaker 7: Speaks to a level of.\nSpeaker 5: I don't know, racketeering or some sort.\nSpeaker 7: Of questionable.\nSpeaker 5: Motivation that lacks transparency. And speaking of transparency, why would the Long Beach City Council incentivize this organization to do their own study, kind of outlining what the economic impact would be of their existence in this partnership? I mean, that kind of speaks of literally asking for some sort of study to be doctored.\nSpeaker 5: I mean, these are questions that hopefully our city councilman would be answering and asking among each other. But it seems as if you guys are seem to be unified on everything, which.\nSpeaker 7: Could be a good a good.\nSpeaker 5: Thing in a lot of ways, but it could be a bad thing in a lot of ways. So I just ask the city council that they, you know, make sure that they're not too focused on, you know, working on bypassing some of these backchannel deals in order to make sure that they keep their political friends and that\nSpeaker 5: they fight for the people of Long Beach and the people who are, you know, who have so much at stake regarding whether or not these programs actually do something for the for the people.\nSpeaker 7: So I'll address you a little bit later on regarding.\nSpeaker 5: Some of the other things that I've seen the city council do.\nSpeaker 3: That specifically hurts the free.\nSpeaker 5: Market, but then the city of Long Beach, but specifically on this matter with the Grand Prix. You can't have them do their own economic study that describes the impact of their existence and simultaneously exclusive negotiating rights to a city manager as a part of a city that hasn't proven that they're willing to, you know, advocate for the\nSpeaker 5: best possible deal. It's not something that I would say would be necessarily a good thing. So I don't think exclusive.\nSpeaker 0: Negotiating rights are critical.\nSpeaker 5: To this program to be implemented. So, you know, I would like to see at least some sort of a discussion about why exclusivity would be bad on this point.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Italy. Yes. My name is Robert Peak from Black Lives Matter and in the name of Jesus Speak. So I did all that he said. And welcome back, Mayor, from seeing Bloomberg help you to bring them New York ideas with you.\nSpeaker 3: Because we need California to stay like it used to be. I have a few things, a nice dress. I like your program and I want to see it. I like that. I like what they're doing over there. Mr. Andrews.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, and also.\nSpeaker 4: Well, you know, this is cool.\nSpeaker 3: I like the race and everything. I don't know too much about that, but I want to segway. I want to take this time the why the people here before they left to say, say no to love control, say no to just.\nSpeaker 0: Cause of it. So we can't we have to actually stick to the race. Please.\nSpeaker 4: This is I'm so glad for that.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm taking this before you send.\nSpeaker 0: Them all out here to say, say no.\nSpeaker 4: Direct control. Don't go with that. This keep this free market.\nSpeaker 3: And that's it.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Honorable Mayors City Council. My name is Ryan Cohen, owner of Core Events, a fourth generation small business owner. My dad started his first business in Long Beach at the traffic circle in 2007. I ventured out on my own to start an event company and every year I drove past that Long Beach Grand Prix and I said I\nSpeaker 4: would want to be a part of that event at some point called Jim and Tim and asked to build. And one of the best things that they did is they casted a vision of what our company would need to look like in order to handle an event of their size and magnitude.\nSpeaker 4: Over the last ten years, we've built a company that handles events such as Coachella, Golden Globes, Grammys. But there's no greater event that I get to work on than the Long Beach Grand Prix. I live in Long Beach, born in Long Beach, and I take an incredible amount of pride of building that event in my backyard.\nSpeaker 4: And with all those different events, I get to work with a lot of different teams. I get to see how they handle their event. And the one thing I can say about the Long Beach Grand Prix team from Jim Martin, Dwight is the fan experience is what they care most about, and that speaks volumes.\nSpeaker 0: Because that guides.\nSpeaker 4: So many of the decisions. Instead of cutting back and doing. Doing things not first rate. They always continue to protect the fan experience and I hope you move forward with them. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Ryan. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Mayor City Council Don Rodriguez, CEO of Boys and Girls Club, the Long Beach. I just want to thank the Grand Prix and King Taco for making affordable for our children and families that were able to go to the Grand Prix.\nSpeaker 4: People that would normally not have the opportunity or the funds to go and they were able to make it. We've had over 10,000 youth and families go over the last ten years thanks to King Taco and the Grand Prix.\nSpeaker 4: And I have one of our youth here that would like to speak on it.\nSpeaker 2: Hi. Hi. My name is Sequoia Simmons. I go to the Boys and Girls Club of Long Beach. I would like to thank you guys for making this happen, because there's most of the young kids that go to my Boys and Girls Club who really want to be someone one day like me.\nSpeaker 2: I want to be an archeologist. And if I wasn't here doing what I was doing at the Boys and Girls Club, I'll probably doing something what I wasn't supposed to do. But thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Rick Derry.\nSpeaker 3: I'm the president of the Grand Prix Foundation of Long Beach. And we thought it would be important tonight to at least make mention of the fact that the Grand Prix Association wears a number of different hats in our community.\nSpeaker 4: One of the most.\nSpeaker 3: Important in my mind is the foundation.\nSpeaker 4: I think most of you know, the.\nSpeaker 3: Foundation has been around for over 25 years. And during that period of time.\nSpeaker 4: We've raised and contributed.\nSpeaker 3: Over four and a half million dollars into local charities. And when I say local charities, they're charities that are basically homegrown. When we were founded, we made a decent determination.\nSpeaker 4: To stay away from the large charities, the ones that.\nSpeaker 3: Have their own 24 hour telethons, and stick with the local one, such as Meals on Wheels and food finders. The Ronald McDonald House at Long Beach Century Club, the Long Beach Day Nursery, the Long Beach Dental Clinic. And the list goes on and on.\nSpeaker 3: We're also very proud of the fact that we're a clearinghouse for the community. The Grand Prix Association gets hundreds of requests every year for tickets to the race.\nSpeaker 4: Where other organizations, charities.\nSpeaker 0: Civic groups.\nSpeaker 4: Can use those tickets to fund their own charity expenses through opportunity.\nSpeaker 3: Drawings, libraries, signage, auctions. And the foundation is the one that handles those requests and then allocates the tickets to so many different groups.\nSpeaker 4: So we thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 3: We appreciate your consideration on our behalf, as well as the Grand Prix. And I brought with me one of our recipient charities, one of the.\nSpeaker 4: The groups that we deal with each year.\nSpeaker 3: Carolyn Bell, who represents the Long Beach Bar Foundation and their program, shortstop.\nSpeaker 2: Think you mean cult members? I just left the dentist, so if I sound a little bit funny, forgive me. But my name is Carolyn Bell. I am the executive director of the shortstop Juvenile Crime Diversion Program. So we're one of the smaller agencies that the Grand Prix Foundation supports.\nSpeaker 2: We've been in Long Beach for over 21 years and we are a juvenile crime diversion program. And as you may know, nonprofits struggle with continuing to get funding and the Grand Prix Foundation has been there for us for over 20 years and we really appreciate their continued support.\nSpeaker 2: Not only do they give us grant funding, they also offer Grand Prix items that we can sell at our auctions and fundraising events. So they've been really instrumental in keeping our program going. I also appreciate the Grand Prix for especially this year.\nSpeaker 2: My son is autistic and they have an adult school in Long Beach and they wanted to go. So they're adult, but they have special needs. And I called Greg. He said, no problem. They got T-shirts, they got tours of the place, they took pictures, they got autographs and they were really grateful.\nSpeaker 2: So that's near and dear to my heart. But most importantly, on the small scale, since we are trying to divert crime for the city of Long Beach, we need support from local foundations to help keep us in operation.\nSpeaker 2: And the Grand Prix Foundation has been truly instrumental with our program and we serve as over 300 families a year and it's for first time juvenile offenders. And if we can catch them on their first offense and divert them away from crime and help them become contributing members of society, then we've done our part in keeping the\nSpeaker 2: city functioning at the level that you'd like to see it function at. And we owe a lot of that to the Grand Prix Foundation as well. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you right now to chair elected the debate. I just want to express our support for a lot of the proposal that we had seen in the earlier slide. Given the modifications.\nSpeaker 2: To the.\nSpeaker 4: The Grand Prix agreement, most notably the term and actually giving it some thoughtful time to actually look about the programing of that site, which is an important asset to the city. In addition to looking at ways of repairing and maintaining the facility once it's been utilized for this important event and of course condensing the impact, meaning the\nSpeaker 4: time set of time and breakdown time of that event. I would like to provide to the council members via the City Clerk a copy of the July tap.\nSpeaker 2: Study that was prepared. So the debate.\nSpeaker 4: Engaged the.\nSpeaker 2: Urban Lands Institute.\nSpeaker 4: A few years ago to actually study this site, knowing its incredible importance to the city and untapped resources and what it could be and looking at it in concert with its partners CDB, the Grand Prix and others, and how one could make it a cohesive structure.\nSpeaker 4: So we applaud the visioning process that's been discussed and outlined and looking forward to playing an active part in the advocacy of that effort.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks, Ryan. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Honorable Mayor. My name is John.\nSpeaker 3: Sagmeister and members of the City Council. It's my pleasure to be here. Brighter days lie ahead for our city, and how we develop our waterfront is key to that success. As I look out at the 70 acres of the parking lot, I think every day as I drive by it, those are jobs that we haven't hired from\nSpeaker 3: our residents, residents in the six, seven, nine districts. It's my privilege to employ several hundred people here in the city. For many of them, it's been their first job.\nSpeaker 5: But I tell.\nSpeaker 4: Them that's not going to be their last job. But what we want.\nSpeaker 3: To teach is. Develop a good work ethic and a great attitude, and you will go a long way from that.\nSpeaker 6: If we look around the world and.\nSpeaker 3: How other cities have.\nSpeaker 4: Approached the.\nSpeaker 3: Development of their waterfront and the keys to.\nSpeaker 4: Their success.\nSpeaker 3: I would encourage us to focus on Barcelona.\nSpeaker 5: San Diego.\nSpeaker 3: Sydney.\nSpeaker 4: Here's an example. In San Diego, in the last nine years, they've developed eight new hotels. And I'm not talking eight stories.\nSpeaker 3: Talking 40 stories.\nSpeaker 4: Thousands of jobs. Thousands and thousands of.\nSpeaker 3: Jobs for San Diego. And this is an opportunity for us and how we develop it and how we thoughtfully discuss this is key to our success. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: How good looking like average eighth district. I just want to quickly say thank you to Kevin for your investment and your belief in Long Beach. You really took the race to another level when things were looking pretty tough.\nSpeaker 2: And Jim, for your amazing leadership and Gemma for holding them all together. You know, the Long Beach Grand Prix does more than just hold an annual race. They do so much for our community overall, and I hope that our city councils will continue to support them for decades to come.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So good, Hugh Laurie.\nSpeaker 4: Good. You're clear. As he addressed, I moved into Long Beach and Grand Prix Day May 1977. It was a Sunday. And if memory serves me correctly, the mayor then was a unique Seattle mayor of impeccable, impeccable character, cut from far, far different cloth than our current mayor.\nSpeaker 4: But I fully support this concept of it in genders dollars, which the city needs. All right. The problem is, of course, the city's management of that money becomes an issue. But we can deal with that later. I'm going to suggest also that when the study is done and I support the concept of having an outside study as\nSpeaker 4: well, is to consider fashioning the venue in such a manner that the event that took place in the Marine Stadium last year, in the year before being relocated down there along our shorefront, it has clearly outgrown that and it shares one thing with the Grand Prix.\nSpeaker 4: It is not quiet. I could hear and people could hear those noises all the way down in Los Altos Shopping Center. And I think having it down in the waterfront area would help tremendously because the buildings themselves was to act as a sound barrier.\nSpeaker 4: And I believe it's a I think there could be legitimate revenue streams to that because obviously the guys are making some pretty good money on there and so forth. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And a final speaker, Arthur, to Mark Short. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 4: Mr. Mayor. And Council. My name is Steve McCullough. Just a guy that's been to 27 consecutive Long Beach Grand Prix. I started 1991, and I want to say I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Chris Puig and Mr. McCallion.\nSpeaker 4: And with that, Mr. Colvin and Mr. Forsyth, it's one of the greatest things that about the L.A. area. It's a highlight of my year and having been to 27 consecutive ones. It just keeps getting better and better every year.\nSpeaker 4: There was a split in open wheel racing here in America once upon a time. And when the when it happened, that one fell. And the other one getting the only thing they wanted was the Long Beach Grand Prix.\nSpeaker 4: They already had the Indianapolis 500. What they wanted was Long Beach. Everything else was negotiable with that. On the other side of it, the international FIA, they want to have market penetration in Southern California. Who doesn't? This is a proven product that we've had for 33 years, since Formula One was once here and then left because of\nSpeaker 4: financial considerations. It wasn't cost effective for them. I'm going to cut this short.\nSpeaker 3: Because I just.\nSpeaker 4: Appreciate your time. Go at the Long Beach Grand Prix. A proven commodity. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And Mr. Sant will be our final speaker, and then we'll go back to the council.\nSpeaker 3: Hi, Tom Stout. I think the Grand Prix Association's done a great job for a lot of years. I started attending the first 5000 race a long time ago. I brought many of my students from my auto class here, compliments of, I guess, the Grand Prix and Toyota.\nSpeaker 3: They enjoyed it immensely. It brings in a lot of income to the city. It's if the city were run as well as the Grand Prix, we wouldn't be having as many taxes as we do. So you guys should maybe talk to them a lot more because they seem to stay within a budget.\nSpeaker 4: And as a lark, I.\nSpeaker 3: Asked one of the council people I got one of my bucket list requests was I'd like to have a seat in the Long Beach booth. And obviously, you know, I didn't think that was going to happen and it wasn't.\nSpeaker 3: I was offered a seat in the section with the people that were promoting Measure A, and since I wrote the ballot argument against it, I just thought that was cruel and unusual punishment. So, Pat, maybe before I expire, I can get that bucket list request.\nSpeaker 3: Maybe you could talk to him.\nSpeaker 4: So Grand Prix is great.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, it's an international event. The only problem is it's so expensive. I mean, that's why it disappeared the first time. You can't afford it. Indy cars, America. Well, at least. Well, I can't say the cars are and I can't say the drivers are.\nSpeaker 3: But the event is there are a few drivers now, so that's good. But it employs a lot of people to keep it. You know, I never thought you were really serious about going with the the Grand Prix anyway.\nSpeaker 3: You've got a proven quality quantity here. Stay with it. Don't screw this up.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. That concludes public comment. We're going to go back to the Council for fair deliberation and comments, starting with Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you so much. I want to thank everybody for coming out tonight and sharing your support or your concerns. An event like this that is such a big deal for our city, not only to the residents that live nearby, but is televised and get such recognition for our city is a big decision.\nSpeaker 2: And so I want to first thank the mayor for our conversations that we've had in the past around visioning for the highest and best use of this piece of land. We want to make sure that as we support the things that we've historically done in the city we're talking about, how do we integrate that into the.\nSpeaker 1: City that we're becoming in the future, and how are we making sure that we're doing that in a community.\nSpeaker 2: Process that's engaging and so thankful for that process? I also want to thank staff. I know Tom and the team have worked really hard on this and Tosha day and special events when we talk about special events in our city.\nSpeaker 2: I cannot imagine a more logistical challenge than this one. And so I really want to just give a round of applause to all the staff that works not only on the past events, but just getting this together today.\nSpeaker 2: So they're fantastic. Round of applause. They deserve it. I don't want to put on a Grand Prix race, let me tell you. I also want to talk just a little bit about the Grand Prix and what I've got to learn about them.\nSpeaker 2: I want to say that Jim has demonstrated a real partnership with the city. I don't know that anybody in the city has reached out to me as often to sit down and talk about not only this, the event itself, but how they're working with those nonprofits, how they're working with our schools, making sure that they're going in\nSpeaker 2: and talking about science, talking about engineering with our kids, and that they're doing that in as many schools as they can. I think they said almost every school except for maybe the elementary schools. And so really appreciate that real partnership that they have there.\nSpeaker 2: I have a few questions for staff. Can you guys elaborate just quickly for us? How long does it take to set up prior to the event historically and take down afterwards?\nSpeaker 10: So historically it's been about a 60 day prior to the events set up in the current event. And then about 17 days after in the last time that we did the contract negotiations, we heard loud and clear from the council in the community to shorten aspects of that.\nSpeaker 10: And so there are aspects that are actually open within 24 hours and taken down within 24 hours of the race. So that is something that we have made a lot of progress on. And we're looking for this next iteration to to shrink that a little bit, particularly on the set up time.\nSpeaker 10: I think we do pretty well on the takedowns time.\nSpeaker 2: Great. And can you share with one other concern that I've heard from community residents? Is the clean up? Is that done by our city employees? Is that done by by Grand Prix or is that done by the bid?\nSpeaker 10: So the Grand Prix Association has some requirements to do clean up after the race and with street sweepers and a number of things. I think what you're referring to more is what happens afterwards after they're all cleaned up.\nSpeaker 10: They do have a requirement to restore the track to its to its prior condition. But we have had challenges with the street marks that are left on the street. We've been looking to find ways to environmentally or to remove those in environmentally safe manner and also in a way that doesn't degradation degrade date the street.\nSpeaker 10: So this year we actually tried, I believe, three different methods to see what we could do. And we believe we finally found one that works. It's actually a pressure washing type of very high pressure to remove those marks.\nSpeaker 10: So we'll be working on that in the next. We've been doing some work actually in July and finishing up in August and and we're going to build that into the contract so that gets done or there'll be a slurry seal in order to keep the streets looking the way that we'd like them to.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you for that. I really have looked through the proposed lease terms, and I think the one that is the most important is that the promoter will provide the city with the economic impact study. And I know there was some questions and concerns.\nSpeaker 2: Can you clarify that that study will be done by a third party?\nSpeaker 10: Yes, it would absolutely be done by a third party. We envision that it would be someone that the Grand Prix Association would go through a process to select and that the city would have a role in making sure that it's an independent third party, that it's a qualified group.\nSpeaker 10: And of course, so we have a lot of the data that they would be looking for, as well as Sebi and others, so that we would be partnering in that in that effort with them.\nSpeaker 2: Great. So in that economic impact study, just want to ensure that we're looking at things like ticket sales, attendance, the number of jobs created. I know that there's some discussion about, you know, that we've had a ton of jobs.\nSpeaker 2: We just had several people here that mentioned that they were on those jobs. So looking at the long term effect for that would be helpful.\nSpeaker 10: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 2: I thoroughly support staff's recommendation. I think that we're, you know, at a unique opportunity where we can talk about doing this for the next five years. It's going to take us a while to envision what else we want to see in downtown.\nSpeaker 2: I think the Grand Prix has again demonstrated a strong partnership with the city and as long as we continue to have transparency and we're able to audit the process, it's also, I think, something that is we've been able to depend on the fact that the city isn't at risk for spending any money, whereas with our other option\nSpeaker 2: , there are a lot of uncertainties from what I can tell. And so again, I think this is the best fit for us and I'm really excited and I hope that my colleagues will continue to support us. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, thank you. I had a question. I think it was answered, but it was basically relative to the economic impact study. And you answer the question, it will be conducted by a third party. I'm looking over I believe it's Montreal's Grand Prix and their commission, of course, with their convention of convention bureau, as I'm sure we will\nSpeaker 1: , as well as their university. So I think that might be another opportunity as well. I know that's up to the Grand Prix, but just throwing it out there and it includes a lot of information which I think would be really great for us to look at in the years ahead.\nSpeaker 1: I know that it's a lot of work to pull together an economic impact report, but to do it in a way that really shines not just on the event but on the city as a whole, I think will speak volumes to what we can do in the future.\nSpeaker 1: I too will be supportive of this as well. I do believe that the Grand Prix has been a really great partner as well. Speaking with Jim on and off through the years and being able to just pick up the phone and call you, I know, of course, not only the community events that you drive, but just the\nSpeaker 1: recognition you give to the city in terms of bringing, you know, the drivers prior to. There's tons of events going on that even other colleagues from various cities and across the regions come to to enjoy here in our city.\nSpeaker 1: And I think it's just a wonderful time for us to gather and really celebrate our city in that sense. And I agree, too. I appreciate Ryan, bring the ULI report because I remember this a few years back and how important that underdeveloped land is, especially our underdeveloped land near water.\nSpeaker 1: And I know as we have these discussions, you know, anything that will be developed, I don't see that happening, you know, in the next five years or so. It takes some time. But in that time I know that the Grand Prix will take all of these proposals terms into consideration and they'll do the best that they can\nSpeaker 1: with our recommendations as well. So all to be supportive of this as well, and I thank you all for being a great partner. Appreciate it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Mango.\nSpeaker 2: Excited to continue our partnership with the Grand Prix of Long Beach. The great things that you do in the community are felt by many. I know that this year, particularly with the heightened awareness related to this RFP, it really got people's ears open and eyes open.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that a lot of things great came out of it. I'm was excited to see the zip code breakdown of who in our own city are purchasing the tickets. I think that it's important for the community to recognize how big of an impact the Grand Prix has, not only on the region but on our neighbors\nSpeaker 2: . And so with that, I also hope that as a part of your economic impact study that we receive a yearly report on who's buying the tickets and what zip codes are they from. It's important that people from outside the city buy those tickets.\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully they're from far enough outside the city that they also reserve a hotel night and so that we can continue to grow that economic impact through utilization of our hotels and our local restaurants. And then hopefully the East Side hotels that are also filling up to the brim will be able to work out structures by which we\nSpeaker 2: help get people downtown, or at least to the blue line to bring them into the community more effectively. For one, I was looking at dates to book my wedding, and when I went to pick a date, the first thing I said was, When's the Grand Prix?\nSpeaker 2: Because our hotels do fill up. And we ended up moving at one week earlier just to make sure that if our family was in town. From Colorado that they'd be able to stay and experience something big for a long beach.\nSpeaker 2: So I appreciate you and I appreciate the name. It's brought to Long Beach. And I also look forward to seeing continued opportunities to feature the Grand Prix in the community at events so that the community year round can remember what a great asset it is and to hold that date a year in advance.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. I echo a lot of the comments of my colleagues. I think I appreciate the work that went into this process by staff and the education by KPMG this evening regarding the process. And I think both of the RFP has presented some great opportunities and things for us to consider.\nSpeaker 8: I have done an extensive amount of research on this topic and I feel very comfortable supporting staff's recommendation this evening. I will say I do have and I want to thank the Grand Prix because over the years they've really integrated into the Long Beach community even outside of the downtown area.\nSpeaker 8: And so we're exposing a lot of our residents to the Grand Prix event and auto racing in general by virtue of the Grand Prix actually going into the communities and introducing folks to the sport of auto racing. And I think that's fantastic.\nSpeaker 8: So thank you. I'm encouraged to hear about the visioning process that we're going to be starting. And I'm I'm assuming from what I'm hearing tonight that this is going to be a process that's going to be parallel, moving parallel to us entering into this contract and entering into this new agreement, such that in five years, we have\nSpeaker 8: the opportunity to not only look at what development in the area could look like any recommendations, and then be prepared to implement any of those recommendations. And I don't know who on staff could maybe talk to the timing of a visioning process for the downtown area for this space.\nSpeaker 8: Is there someone who could talk to us a little bit about the timing and what we can expect in terms of this visioning process?\nSpeaker 10: So, Councilmember Price, I can give it a shot. We don't have a specific time yet where everything's laid out, but what we envision, we've actually already started. What one of the major things we need to do is this is one of the most complex parcels that we have in the city.\nSpeaker 10: It's got convention center uses on it. It's down in the coastal area. It's state lands, has a role down there. We have a lot of events on that space. So one of the things we're doing right now is going through an analysis of what is what are the encumbrances, where are the opportunities.\nSpeaker 10: This is obviously the site also for the Olympics that we've chosen in 2028. And how does that factor into it? So we imagine that's going to take a couple of months to really dove into all the operating agreements that we have for that space.\nSpeaker 10: Then we do want to kind of identify for the council what a visioning process could take and and how long that would take. And if there is financial resources that need to be dedicated, we want to start kind of on a on a low cost, obviously, to to start generating some of those ideas.\nSpeaker 10: And then as the visioning gets nearer and nearer, then there's other steps that would happen, such as updating PD sixes. The mayor mentioned, updating some of our zoning documents. So it would be a longer term process, but we would have some information back to the council fairly soon in the next couple months on kind of what that\nSpeaker 10: what the constraints are, what are some of the opportunities and then how we would move forward with the visioning process?\nSpeaker 8: Well, that's encouraging. And the reason I asked that question is because it is a lengthy process and we have a five year window to get ourselves in a situation where we're looking at opportunities and actually planning for implementation.\nSpeaker 8: Should we decide to do something different after that five years, should the sport of racing change in terms of trends, I think we should be in a position where we have data and some clear recommendations in terms of where we're headed.\nSpeaker 8: So I think that's really important and I appreciate that that we will get updates on this as we move forward so that at that five year mark, we're able to make some decisions. I was impressed by the construction period and the proposal by wack, so I'm hoping that we're able to make that a priority in our negotiations\nSpeaker 8: because I do know that that's something that Council has articulated very clearly, is an issue for our businesses in the area and our residents, of course. So to the extent and I heard Mr. Rodak, I heard you say that that's going to be something that we're going to try to impose some priority on during the negotiations.\nSpeaker 8: So to the extent that I could underscore that, I would like to do so. And I think that that's an important one. But but beyond that, I think staff for the recommendations and all of the folks from the Grand Prix for being here too tonight, for your support throughout the year and for integrating auto racing into our\nSpeaker 8: communities in a way that's. Very positive. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Dear Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And I'll also be supportive of staff's recommendation. I think the Grand Prix is of Long Beach, is truly part of our city's DNA, our identity as much as the Queen Mary is in many ways. When people across the country think about Long Beach, the Grand Prix is one of the the points that that is also\nSpeaker 3: often raised. You know, I think it was mentioned that and I didn't know that we were the second largest IndyCar event in North America next to the Indianapolis 500 and the largest streetcar race in the country. I thought it was actually in Detroit, but that was my first experience to a Grand Prix.\nSpeaker 3: But I did have some some questions and I'm encouraged to hear that as we negotiate this, Indy, that there will be emphasis on economic impacts because I think, you know, the $40 million of income on comic impact that's presented and represented by the the Grand Prix along beaches is great.\nSpeaker 3: I'm interested in breaking that down and understanding how that is measured and how we can grow capacity in that regard and improve that economic impact if possible. And the same thing with attendance. All right. You know, I think the number has been thrown out that there was 183,000 participants and fans who enjoy the Long Beach Grand Prix\nSpeaker 3: . That is an impressive number. I want to know how we arrive at that number. I'm interested in knowing the methodology and again, how we can improve the capacity in that regard as well. And so I think the economic impact of study is something that I think is very important in terms of this negotiations.\nSpeaker 3: Again, I will be extremely supportive of this, I think, and I look forward to attending the next Grand Prix. I haven't missed one in many years. Thank you again.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Wawrinka.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you very much. My late father in law was a great, great fan of the Grand Prix, and I think he would kill me if I didn't support decision. But speaking of the Grand Prix and I know that there was a lot of study that went into it and obviously the feasibility of one versus the other came\nSpeaker 9: down to what would be the best race that we could have with the conditions that currently exist. What are the points that came out here that really stood out? Was the immediate availability of the Grand Prix to put out put on a race and the inability of the other or the wag to put on their race and\nSpeaker 9: not until 2020. And with that, the additional changes that would need to be made, such as extending the track and adding some other improvements to to the race itself. One question, I don't know who can address this, but does the Grand Prix have any permanent fixtures in the race that those that might last see that go up\nSpeaker 9: for the race but then stay up there for the next race the following year? Are there any permanent structures allowing the race round or anywhere for the Grand Prix?\nSpeaker 10: No, we don't believe that there are any permanent structures. It's essentially going to be the proposal that you see today, which is temporary. It gets put up and it gets taken down. That being said, there was a potential in the back proposal for a permanent structure or it could have been temporary staff looking at the size of\nSpeaker 10: it, kind of deemed that it would likely be a permanent facility, which of course would get into the council commission arena and really have to start looking at the permitting process for a permanent facility.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, and that's what led to this question because I was looking at the at slide six in the what you gave us here, there are some proposed buildings, I guess, that would be there that would be permanent and a bit on the north side of the track, which would basically be on a year round basis, interfere with\nSpeaker 9: the view shades of people who come down to the beach and those structures be there and just interfere with the views to the beach. So, I mean, that that was something that I would not be able to support even here for, let alone it and the Coastal Commission, because the effect that it would have on view should\nSpeaker 9: and that is to the next question as well as in church. When we look at the at the at the visioning that we keep that in mind that the the current structure of the race is such that it's used for what is it, about 60 days in and 15 days after I guess, or something like that.\nSpeaker 9: And. Then it goes back to normal. I mean, it's it's like you wouldn't even know that a race was held there until the following year. So, I mean, I love that. I love the fact that we're able to hold a race, bring in a couple of hundred thousands of people to enjoy it.\nSpeaker 9: And then once it's done, it goes back to to normal, to being to be what the Long Beach offers, which is a great view of our ocean and a great opportunity to wine and dine and enjoy all the amenities that Long Beach has to offer along the shore.\nSpeaker 9: So in looking at this, I hope that it's not an issue now, but maybe we should put it on paper is a fact that hopefully during the negotiations that we can include in there an item that would that would restrict any structures being put up along the race that would be permanent in nature.\nSpeaker 9: Because I would like to have a permanent opportunity for us to put up and take down and return our, our shoreline to to its existing in 16 forms. So that that would be if if it's needed, fine, if not fine, too.\nSpeaker 9: But we won't want to memorialize that just so that we have it on paper, so that in the future, should there be a request to have a permanent structure put on there, that it would fit certain criteria, that that would not infringe on our views alone, of course, in long shortly.\nSpeaker 9: That's all.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Now.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Just very briefly, I wanted to ask staff and I'm not sure if if Tom or John would like to answer this, but if it proved tonight, can you tell us for the next 90 days, will there be a two from four member come back to us where there were other milestones that that council should look\nSpeaker 6: at over the next 90 days?\nSpeaker 10: So I'll start with that. We are envisioning going fairly quickly. Hopefully we're spelling out and it's helpful to get the council's input on those terms right now so that these are essentially going to be the major terms. We would sit down for 90 days and work with our partner and then we would come back with a council\nSpeaker 10: agenda item. If at the end of 90 days, if we're not going to hit that mark, I don't think there would be an issue. But if there were an issue, we would do a two from four memo and let you know that we're going to need to extend by 30 days or 60 days and give you an\nSpeaker 10: update of where we are.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thank you. And Councilwoman Mongo mentioned the impacts on the east side of town with the hotels. And I can tell you that the association got us on IndyCar before the race in April and we parked in front of Joe Joe's and took a picture.\nSpeaker 6: And as of tonight, they've got 927 likes and a 97 share. So it's a popular item. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to chime in and say I know a number of cities would love to be in this position, to have two world class races competing and come into our city and the opportunity to go ahead and further develop more opportunities in our waterfront.\nSpeaker 6: And so we should just take a moment and just acknowledge that as a city, I think I want to start with just thanking the Grand Prix Association and all of the family that is associated with them for conducting themselves in a way that the city staff feels comfortable making this recommendation to the City Council.\nSpeaker 6: I want to say thank you to the grant to Formula One for expressing this interest and coming through this process and allowing us to sort of test our mettle a little bit here. And I and I would say I think this is a smart approach.\nSpeaker 6: This five year agreement with the option to extend because it allows us to conduct those that visioning about the highest and best use of the area and allow some options to be placed on the table for the city council in the years to come for some flexibility.\nSpeaker 6: So to all the players, all the stakeholders. I look forward to many more fantastic races. You know, I've probably been to three or four of them, so I'm pretty new compared to people who have been going for, you know, I've heard, you know, 20, 30 years.\nSpeaker 6: But but we have a fantastic time every year and we get to know more and more people. And I brag about it more and more every year when I leave our city. Have you been to our Grand Prix?\nSpeaker 6: Because I feel pretty embarrassed. My first three or four years living in the city, I never I never I had never attended. So I think many more people are going to continue to discover this Grand Prix and what it what it really the way that it really demonstrates and showcases are our downtown.\nSpeaker 6: Thanks a lot and obviously has my support.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and go to a council vote. So, members, please go ahead and cast your votes on the motion in front of us, please.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. And of course, to Kevin, Jim, the association, all the incredible volunteers and community members. Just thank you for your partnership with the city of Long Beach. We look forward to many more years with the race and to our partnership in many other ways as well.\nSpeaker 0: So just thank you to the team and I thank you all for being out here. We're going to transition to the regular agenda. We I and this is I know an extensive agenda. We actually have three hearings that we have to go through.\nSpeaker 0: So if you're not here for one of the hearings, I do apologize. This is a long a very long agenda. And so if I can ask everyone, this would be a good time to exit if you're not here for if you're here for the Grand Prix.\nSpeaker 0: And we're going to go into our three hearings here in just a minute. So I'm scared. Just I'm going to restart in just one minute so people can exit. Okay. One minute.\nSpeaker 4: Bring us that. No. Okay, Kelly.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We're going to go ahead and get started back. So please, if I can if I can have everyone exit the chambers that wants to chat and can continue with the meeting.\nSpeaker 4: Here.\nSpeaker 0: So people can please take a seat when you get started. Madam Clerk, can we do a roll call? Police.\nSpeaker 3: There was.\nSpeaker 1: Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilmember Pierce. Councilwoman Price. Councilmember. Super now. Councilwoman Mongo. Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember Urunga. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 1: Vice Mayor Richardson. Mayor Garcia.\nSpeaker 0: I'm here. Thank you.

May we please have the staff report?\nSpeaker 1: And.\nSpeaker 8: Good evening again. Andrew Robb again here from Community Planning and Development to present this proposed rezoning of properties at 2524 through 2660 Larimer Street and 2609, 26, 23 and 2641 Lawrence Street. From a mix of former Chapter 59 and Denver Zoning Code Commercial, multi-unit and mixed use zoning to a planned unit.\nSpeaker 1: For developers TV.\nSpeaker 8: This project. This proposal is in Council District nine.\nSpeaker 1: It is located.\nSpeaker 8: In these five points neighborhood to the existing zoning in the area is a mix of primarily old form chapter 59 Code CMU 30 district. Parts of the subject site also have districts from the Denver Zoning Code, including I am x three, an industrial mixed use district and GM three a multi-unit residential district.\nSpeaker 8: Zoning around around the site is primarily a mixed a range of mixed use, residential mixed use and multi-unit zoned districts with three storey building heights. Typically, there are also a few areas of two storey and a five story zoning and quite a bit of other examples of former Chapter 59 zoning in the surrounding area.\nSpeaker 8: Existing land uses on the site itself include office commercial and retail uses in industrial uses with some large parts of the property currently in use for circa surface parking or or sitting vacant. Surrounding uses in the rezoning area include commercial and retail uses, office uses and mixed use mostly along Larimer, but with some nonresidential nonresidential uses on\nSpeaker 8: the Lawrence side as well. And then multi-unit residential land uses are also present in the area around this proposal. There are two Denver landmark historic districts and close proximity to the proposed rezoning area. The Ballpark Neighborhood Historic District is shown across Larimer to the northwest of the site, and the Curtis Park Historic District can be seen there\nSpeaker 8: to the southeast.\nSpeaker 1: Of the site.\nSpeaker 8: Existing context immediately to the rezoning area is made up of a variety of one generally 1 to 4 story structures on the top left. Photo here you can see the Brunetti Lofts, four storey residential structure across the street across Larimer at 26th.\nSpeaker 8: The block to the Southeast contains the recently completed three story Eva Reinhard development. There are also several three and a half storey townhomes to the south and east portion of the rezoning boundary to the south at 26th Street on an on the north side of the.\nSpeaker 8: The three story Volunteers of America Building is on the subject site at the northwest corner and then across the street from VOA. There are several one and two story commercial structures. So this request is to rezone to a general planned unit development district, which would be called Pdg 28 if adopted.\nSpeaker 8: This proposal, this PD would deviate from the standard Denver zoning code districts in several ways. Most notably, this would establish varying height zones within the overall PUD boundary and limit the height of rooftop encroachments. It would impose upper storey setbacks on the third and fifth storeys would require 10% publicly accessible open space and pedestrian connections to Lawrence\nSpeaker 8: , Larimer and 26th Street. It would require the facade from the Joes liquor building to be repaired and integrated into a future redevelopment. The PAD also directly incorporates the requirements of the River North Design Overlay or the DOE seven into the district.\nSpeaker 8: There are a couple of other use overlays currently on the subject site that allow adult uses and billboards. Those overlays would be removed and extinguished as part.\nSpeaker 1: Of this design.\nSpeaker 8: In terms of the formal adoption process for this proposed rezoning. The informational notice went out in February and then Planning for notice was posted in April. Planning Board Public Hearing was held on April 20th, and the Planning Board voted 6 to 1 to recommend approval of this proposed rezoning.\nSpeaker 8: The City Council's Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee considered this proposed rezoning on May 3rd and voted to move it forward to the full City Council for a hearing with regard to public comments. We received three letters in support from our knows that whose boundaries include the subject site, including Curtis Park, Neighbors, part of Five Points and\nSpeaker 8: the Reno art district. We've also received quite a bit of written public comment, all of which is included in the packet that was provided to the City Council. It includes 97 letters or written comments in support, as well as 112 petition signatures that were collected in support of this proposal.\nSpeaker 8: And then 50 letters and comments in opposition, as well as 126 petitions gathered indicating opposition to this proposed rezoning. I do want to note that we always strive for accuracy, but there may be instances of duplicate written comments in that record, so these numbers should be considered estimates.\nSpeaker 8: The applicant began outreach for this project in March of last year and that kind of continued through February of this year. They held four community open houses, several presentations to local homeowners associations and community members. They provided briefings and written updates to council members beginning again in the spring of last year and through late last year.\nSpeaker 8: And briefings with individuals, businesses and other affected neighbors continued through last year and into early this year. As the Council was aware the these five took to adopt a proposed rezoning. The Council must find that the rezoning is consistent with these five criteria in the Denver zoning code.\nSpeaker 8: So with regard to the first criteria, there are three adopted plans that apply the comprehensive plan blueprint, Denver and the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan, which was adopted in 2011. This proposed rezoning is consistent with several comprehensive plan 2040 recommendations.\nSpeaker 8: Most notably, the rezoning supports goals to create a greater mix of housing options and to stabilize residents and businesses in ways that help them stay in their existing community. It also supports the ability to create business opportunities that serve nearby neighborhoods and promote small, locally owned businesses.\nSpeaker 8: Finally, this represents an opportunity for infill development where infrastructure and municipal services already exist. With regard to Blueprint Denver, the portion of the rezoning area along Larimer is identified in the urban centric context. The proposed PWD in this particular area would establish the C, M, X five and C max eight zone districts which are in the urban\nSpeaker 8: center neighborhood context and are intended to to create vibrant, walkable, mixed use neighborhoods. The area along Lawrence is identified as General Urban in blueprint as a neighborhood context. This proposed DVD would establish a base zone district of grx5, a residential mixed use zone district in the general urban neighborhood context which makes it an appropriate request.\nSpeaker 8: Blueprint. Denver identifies this area as being within a future place of community corridor on the on the Larimer side and high medium residential on the Lawrence side in Blueprint. Both of these future place types are described as having heights, generally up to eight stories.\nSpeaker 8: The proposed rezoning and standards within PG 28 are appropriate with these future place design descriptions and will help foster a balance of mixed use opportunities and a strong pedestrian realm that the current zoning or a standard zoned district would not allow.\nSpeaker 8: Aligned with those future place designations. The growth strategy for this area is balanced between community centers and corridors and all other areas of the city, as you can see on the map on this slide. According to Blueprint, fostering and focusing growth in community centers and corridors helps provide a variety of housing, jobs and entertainment options within a\nSpeaker 8: comfortable distance. To all, Denver writes and is a key element of building complete neighborhoods throughout Denver. The proposed PDE zone district allows a broad range of residential and commercial land uses with a shallow front setback, and allows the mix of land use is anticipated for the mixed use collector street type identified along Larimer and on Lawrence.\nSpeaker 8: Commercial uses are only allowed on the ground floor, and businesses are intended to serve the needs of local residents as appropriate for the residential collector, as Lawrence is identified. Several other recommendations of Blueprint are also advanced by this proposed rezoning, including language calling for establishing higher intensity uses where infrastructure already exists and close to transit, promoting creative\nSpeaker 8: industries and so on. With regard to with regard to Blueprint, Blueprint does address custom zoning. It does say to limit the use of site specific and customized zoning tools like planned unit developments and waivers and physicians to unique and extraordinary circumstances.\nSpeaker 8: This proposal is fairly unique due to the specific development challenges associated with the proposed rezoning area, including integration of existing buildings on site alley, right of way vacation and relocation of utilities, overall phasing and timing of the project and creating appropriate transitions to the ballpark.\nSpeaker 8: And Curtis Park historic districts and residential areas. There isn't a single standard zone district or combination of zone districts that could successfully address the site's unique and extraordinary circumstances. With regard to the area plan that impacts this area, the downtown, the northeast, downtown neighborhoods plan.\nSpeaker 8: This site falls into two different areas in the plan, the Curtis Park neighborhood identified along Lawrence. And then the majority of the site, as you can see on the map here, is in the ballpark River North neighborhood along Larimer.\nSpeaker 8: Similarly, the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan splits this rezoning area into two land use descriptions. The area, along Larimer is envisioned to be mixed use industrial. In the area along Lawrence falls into the urban residential category. The urban residential area is intended to be primarily residential, but as described, it can may include a number of complementary commercial uses\nSpeaker 8: . Several additional recommendations and policies within the downtown. The Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods plan would be supported by this proposed rezoning. The mix of uses, mixed heights and scale, and the use of design elements like upper story setbacks support the goal of transitioning away from commercial corridors for residential neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 8: There are also goals to adaptively reuse existing buildings and to strengthen corridors like Larimer by developing viable retail clusters to serve those who work, live and visit this area. One area where this proposed rezoning is contradictory to the Northeast Downtowns Neighborhoods Neighborhoods Plan is the concept height map in that plan, which shows this area as three stories\nSpeaker 8: . The intent of that plan was that the area between Larimer and Arapaho would serve as a transition from taller areas in the Northwest to the historic lower scale residential character of Curtis Park in the Southwest. As discussed earlier, blueprint Denver does include height guidance and in its own description of future places and neighborhood context.\nSpeaker 8: In this case, eight stories in situation where there is conflicting guidance. Blueprint lists several factors that should be considered when evaluating a rezoning proposal, including the small area plan surrounding an existing and planned context, and the ability to achieve community benefits and the potential to further urban design goals.\nSpeaker 8: The small area plan guidance on height is lower than this proposal, yet there are descriptions in the applicable land use categories in the northeastern downtown neighborhoods plan that indicate some flexibility could be appropriate. The mixed use industrial designation refers to a variety of mid to high density housing options and mid to high rise residential structures could be\nSpeaker 8: located in the urban residential area. These land use designations do cross over into areas with taller heights than three stories, so that should also be taken into consideration. The existing context that is directly adjacent to the site includes a number of three, three and a half and four story structures, some of which are shown here on this\nSpeaker 8: map. In addition, as part of the recently adopted changes to the Denver Zoning Code, as part of the Expanding Housing Affordability Project, three story mixed use and multi-unit zoned districts throughout the city could automatically qualify for four four stories of height and five story districts could qualify for seven stories if they meet enhanced standards for providing affordable\nSpeaker 8: housing. This applicant has also worked closely with multiple entities on on providing a series of community benefits which are typically required as part of the rezoning. And that includes work with the Department of Housing Stability and, and the Office of Neighborhood Equity or NEST or Equity and Stabilization.\nSpeaker 8: My apologies to develop and finalize agreements with the city and with community organizations and businesses. They have finalized a housing agreement that would meet the recently adopted enhanced requirements for affordable housing. In addition, the applicants have agreed to provide space for local minority owned businesses at reduced rents to sponsor artist in residence.\nSpeaker 8: An Exchange Program. A commitment to go through the Reno District design review process for new development and covenant restrictions on specific liquor license types for the proposed commercial spaces along Lawrence. The proposed rezoning is also integral to maintaining the long term presence of the Volunteers of America of Colorado and Larimer, and allowing them to create expanded kitchen\nSpeaker 8: facilities elsewhere to provide meals to some of Denver's most vulnerable, vulnerable residents. And the applicants are currently working with the Denver Urban Redevelopment Authority on a potential urban redevelopment plan, which they expect to bring forward to city council late this year.\nSpeaker 8: Finally, the proposed PUD modifies the standard Denver zoning code districts to better address urban design goals, including restricting the seven storey height to approximately 25% of the site area, establishing new upper storey setbacks that apply on all streets, requiring 10% publicly accessible open space and integrating existing structures into future redevelopment.\nSpeaker 8: So with regard to the other standard rezoning criteria, this proposed rezoning will result in the uniform application of the building form, use and design regulations of the base of the proposed base districts, which includes IMX, ACM x five, g, rx5 and the Doh seven or River North Design Overlay District.\nSpeaker 8: It will further public health, safety and welfare by implementing adopted plans and enhancing design standards and open space amenities and encouraging additional walkability in the area. With regard to justifying circumstances, the fourth criterion there has been significant change and new development around the rezoning area in recent years, and the city has adopted plans focusing residents and businesses\nSpeaker 8: along key community corridors like Larimer, for example. And then finally, with regard to the fifth criterion. This party uses a base zone districts again of CMCs and G r x, which will ensure neighborhood compatibility and consistency with the neighborhood context zone, district purpose and intent of the zoning code.\nSpeaker 8: In addition to the those criteria for for all rezonings, Pwds are also required to meet a set of additional criteria in the Denver zoning code, and they're shown here. I won't go into into detail on these, but suffice it to say that we have examined and reviewed and have found that these proposed this proposed rezoning is consistent\nSpeaker 8: with the additional PUD criteria. It does establish building forms that are compatible with adjacent existing building forms. It establishes permitted uses that are compatible with existing land uses adjacent to the subject property and would allow development proposed development that is not feasible under under standard zoned districts without unreasonable number of variances or waivers and conditions, for example\nSpeaker 8: , to establish the the lower seven storey height in an eight storey zoned district or the upper storey step acts. So with that, CPD recommends approval based on a finding that all the review criteria have been met. And I'm happy to stand.\nSpeaker 1: For any questions.\nSpeaker 8: And I know many representing representatives of the applicants are here as well to.\nSpeaker 1: Be bipartisan support.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Well, thank you, Andrew, for the staff report. We have 52 individuals signed up to speak this evening. And I'm going to go ahead and call the first few speakers that are participating in person. And then after those speakers will transition to virtually and then we'll come back in person.\nSpeaker 0: I would ask that folks keep their comments brief. If you don't feel like you need to use your entire 3 minutes. Don't feel like you have to fill it. And if you feel like you're repeating things that somebody already said, that's probably a good time to cut your comments short.\nSpeaker 0: And so we will go ahead and get started here. Tom Keller is our first speaker. And I'll just remind folks, we asked you for the public record. State your name and your city of residence or your home address, whatever you feel most comfortable with.\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead, please, sir.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, city council members. My name is Tom Keeler. My family and I have lived in the city of Denver since 2014. We're proud to call our city home. I'm managing director of Edens, which is a woman led retail real estate company whose mission is to enrich community.\nSpeaker 1: We accomplish that in Denver by focusing on connecting to nature, inclusive design and a commitment to serve the neighborhoods where we operate. Our property in five points consists of and is represented by about 50% bipoc and women owned businesses spanning across one and a half city blocks that we've known since 2018.\nSpeaker 1: Over the last four years, our approach has been to combine small, local entrepreneurs with more nationally well-known retailers to create a more interesting, diverse and unique retail ecosystem. The project that we're here to talk about tonight is an expansion of that, and it's a partnership with the Volunteers of America, Colorado, to create a thriving mixed use neighborhood\nSpeaker 1: hub through collaboration with neighborhood groups like The Heart of 5.0, Curtis Park, Neighbors, Rhino Art District, as well as the broader five points community. We've created a vibrant center that will provide neighborhood serving retail activities, sidewalks and publicly accessible open space.\nSpeaker 1: Affordable housing, multimodal transportation connections, and most importantly, further to volunteers of America's mission within our city, which is at a point that it needs to move forward. Through our collaboration with the neighborhood. Over the last 15 months, we've held 18 community meetings and open houses, as well as provided dozens of tours to neighbors and community stakeholders.\nSpeaker 1: And our project represents this feedback, including design specifications to connect and transition into the surrounding neighborhood fabric. Along with laying the groundwork for a robust set of community benefits. 10% of our residential units will be offered at 60%, and my rent levels will formalize a small business incubator program focused on bipoc and women owned businesses.\nSpeaker 1: Create a commissary kitchen program to allow local food entrepreneurs to thrive in the neighborhood. And then lastly, create an artist residency exchange program to give our local artists exposure to larger markets. All of this based on community feedback and led with community partnerships, including green spaces, community wealth building, no cost productions and local artists.\nSpeaker 1: Thomas. Detour. Evans. We're excited to be here tonight and are happy to answer any questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. Our next speaker is Blair. Looks and feels.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening.\nSpeaker 3: Members of City Council. My name is Blair Lipton. 410 17th Street, Denver, Colorado. 80202i work for Browns Union. I'm Landry's counsel to Eden's first legislative quickly referenced a letter from me, dated April 12, 2022. It included on page 253 of the CPD staff report tonight, I'd like to specifically discuss the application's compliance with the approval criteria requiring\nSpeaker 3: that an.\nSpeaker 2: Official MAP amendment must be consistent with adopted clear guidance for the subject property in order to be approved. While the subject.\nSpeaker 3: Property is governed by four.\nSpeaker 2: Adopted plans. I'm going to only address.\nSpeaker 3: The Northeast Denver Neighborhood Plan or NDP. The NDP was adopted in May 2011, and the proposed update is.\nSpeaker 2: Consistent with all of the guiding principles set forth in that plan. All is noted.\nSpeaker 3: In my April letter and the CPD's staff report.\nSpeaker 2: Blueprint designates the property as being.\nSpeaker 3: Appropriate for height of up to eight storeys. And here the beauty provides for a variety of heights over the subject property. Providing sensitive and.\nSpeaker 2: Appropriate height transitions through a maximum of seven storeys down.\nSpeaker 3: To three stories.\nSpeaker 2: While the concept height map on page.\nSpeaker 3: 19 of the NDP suggests that the property should be developed with height up to three stories. The NDP, in fact, the Access to Individual Neighborhoods Strategies section and on page 16, it is specifically stated that a variety of mid to high.\nSpeaker 2: Density housing options and mid to high rise.\nSpeaker 3: Residential structures are appropriate for the property, evidencing an intent in the end to allow height in excess of three stories on this property. As you know, blueprint contemplates circumstances makes this we're building heights taller.\nSpeaker 2: Than those prescribed under.\nSpeaker 3: An applicable small area plan. Guidance may be appropriate and can consider factors such as.\nSpeaker 2: Guidance from the current small area plan surrounding context transitions, adjacency to transit.\nSpeaker 3: Satisfaction of plan, goals for community benefits which include affordable housing.\nSpeaker 2: And the furtherance of design goals. Given all of the foregoing, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the totality.\nSpeaker 3: Of the NDP, including the height recommendations and neighborhood strategy recommendations. The community has expressed support for the project's height and density as part of the project's delivery of the following community benefits adaptive reuse of existing structures, affordable housing, urban design enhancements more publicly accessible open space that's integrated with nature community serving retail large scale public realm improvements\nSpeaker 3: enhance retail corridors, activated streets, access to neighborhood services, delivery of incubator, commercial space for small bipoc owned and women owned businesses, and an exchange residency program for local artists. In conclusion.\nSpeaker 2: This rezoning is consistent with.\nSpeaker 3: All of the city's adopted plans, including and DNP. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Our next speaker is John McIntyre.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Members of the city council. My name is John McIntyre. I'm a principal at Schreiber Architects based in Capitol Hill. I'm an architect and urban designer, a member of the applicant team. Schreiber is proud of our civic legacy within Denver.\nSpeaker 1: I'm privileged to be working on this project with Edens. We believe it offers a transformational opportunity to strengthen and connect the surrounding communities, to enhance the character, vibrancy and resilience of both the neighborhood and the city, and to fulfill a broader array of plan objectives.\nSpeaker 1: This property sits at a unique location along the Larimer Community Corridor between historic districts and at the convergence of a number of commercial and residential neighborhoods. Its location is equidistant from both Denver Union Station and the 38th and Blake Station.\nSpeaker 1: And due to this, it plays a critical role in closing the gap between these transportation nodes and in providing opportunities for enhanced walkability access and open space for the surrounding neighborhoods. Unlike any other property along Larimer, the site is connected directly to the Welton Street corridor along 26th and 27th streets, which provide designated bike and pedestrian priority\nSpeaker 1: routes respectively. It is directly served by bus and will improve local connectivity through an enhanced focus on micromobility options. The Park provides protection and preservation of the existing VOA and Joe's Liquors Buildings on a site located between neighboring historic districts.\nSpeaker 1: The retention of these buildings assists in enabling appropriate neighborhood transitions and complements the retained fabric of the applicant's existing properties across Larimer Street. As an extension of this existing retail cluster. The park will facilitate the ability to extend the public realm with the site, activate additional streets with a variety of retail offerings, and expand an authentic and\nSpeaker 1: vibrant community center that is already vitally important to the character, culture, history and economic vitality of the neighborhood. The party will further fulfill the principles of a 15 minute Liverpool City providing community serving retail, uses employment opportunities, a diversity of housing, offers enhanced open space and places for people together and connect within a ten minute walk of\nSpeaker 1: both well-established and emerging residential neighborhoods. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Dave Schock.\nSpeaker 0: Also in chambers.\nSpeaker 7: Reading City Council. My name is Dave Shoke, and I'm president and CEO of Volunteers of America, Colorado. Thank you for this opportunity. VOA Colorado is a nonprofit, faith based organization that provides important housing, community outreach and especially hunger and nutrition services.\nSpeaker 7: To those Coloradans experiencing.\nSpeaker 1: Hardship and among many other.\nSpeaker 7: Services, we serve over 1 million meals a year to over 60,000 Coloradoans.\nSpeaker 1: A current commercial kitchen and food warehouse facility at two 2660.\nSpeaker 7: Larimer has seen tremendous growth over the last several years, and as a result, we've simply outgrown our space and we are in.\nSpeaker 1: Immediate need of upgrading our operational equipment. And we do need to do this now. It's important to note that we love this neighborhood and we've been a part of it for over 125 years in various locations on Larimer.\nSpeaker 1: And for us, this is just about our commercial kitchen. Through our partnership with Edens, we now have the ability to relocate.\nSpeaker 7: And improve and expand our food operations.\nSpeaker 1: To another facility outside of downtown Denver. We couldn't have done this without Edens. Edens in general, and.\nSpeaker 7: Tom Keeler in particular, have been good and honorable partners, creative in helping.\nSpeaker 1: Us achieve our needs to serve Colorado. And it's very important. This is very important to a nonprofit like ours. And we strongly believe that Eaton's application is good for the neighborhood, and it certainly is good.\nSpeaker 7: For the many underserved people that the Colorado feeds.\nSpeaker 6: And cares for. And as a result.\nSpeaker 7: We're strongly in favor.\nSpeaker 1: Of this application. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Also in Chambers, Lindsey Center. The. Council members.\nSpeaker 1: You've already.\nSpeaker 2: Heard many good.\nSpeaker 1: Reasons to vote in support of the Inn's zoning.\nSpeaker 2: Reclassification. The developer and our partner.\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to add or reiterate just three more. One.\nSpeaker 2: As someone who has spent.\nSpeaker 1: Four decades with Volunteers of America and over three of those decades.\nSpeaker 2: On the street in one place or another working in this community, in this plan to revitalize the.\nSpeaker 1: 2520 600 blocks of Larimer, will.\nSpeaker 2: Allow it to flourish in the best possible way and adding substance in the form of housing and a development that will fit with the surrounding retail and street market vibe and add desired community amenities.\nSpeaker 1: It's hard to.\nSpeaker 2: Imagine another developer even coming close to what Edens has already done for the area and their plan.\nSpeaker 1: For this two block.\nSpeaker 2: Area. Number two, the presence of a nonprofit human service provider like Volunteers of America in the area has been.\nSpeaker 1: Of great benefit to the community.\nSpeaker 2: As Dave Shank, our CEO, has said. Our headquarters will.\nSpeaker 1: Remain.\nSpeaker 2: At its current location and along with a service center.\nSpeaker 1: Just two blocks from.\nSpeaker 2: At 29th and Lawrence and number three.\nSpeaker 1: Tonight's vote is of.\nSpeaker 2: Great importance to Volunteers of America. Since the council approval of this project is the final step, needed to get the ball rolling, including Volunteers of America are always renovation and move to a much larger. State of the art kitchen, our new better space.\nSpeaker 2: We will increase meals delivered to homebound elderly. We will provide space to grow our services.\nSpeaker 1: Have a.\nSpeaker 2: Warehouse that serves a foodbank that serves other.\nSpeaker 1: Food banks will be much larger warehouse. And also all of our staff doing the.\nSpeaker 2: Handyman, healthy, aging.\nSpeaker 1: And volunteer programs for seniors will be able to grow at our new location. Thank you for.\nSpeaker 2: Your time and consideration. Thank you, Andy. Can you introduce yourself? I'm sorry. Lindy Sinton, vice president of Programs for Volunteers of America. And I live in Arvada.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: We'll move online. Jesse Paris. I don't believe he's in Zoom any. Now. I will go on to Greg home.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. My name is Greg Home. I've lived in the city of Denver.\nSpeaker 2: For 33 years.\nSpeaker 1: I'm housing activists working to ensure housing is available to all Denver residents at all stages of life. I'm speaking in support of the project. This project provides crucially.\nSpeaker 2: Important affordable.\nSpeaker 7: Housing.\nSpeaker 1: While also creating small business incubator opportunities for bipoc and women owned business entrepreneurs. These factors.\nSpeaker 2: Will keep the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: Vibrant, thriving and inclusive for residents and business owners. Denver is in a housing crisis. Fox, 31, recently reported Denver is the seventh most costly housing market in the U.S. and the Denver Business Journal says Denver is the fifth least affordable city for the University of Denver.\nSpeaker 1: The Q1 2022 apartment vacancy rate is in its historic low of 4.3%. And according to Denver, rents increased nearly 35%.\nSpeaker 2: During 2020 and 2021.\nSpeaker 1: This crisis results from two major factors the restriction of housing.\nSpeaker 7: Supply over the last three or four decades.\nSpeaker 1: Through activism by homeowners and neighborhood associations who use their privilege and knowledge of the zoning code to stop construction of multifamily housing. In addition, the lock up of 77% of the land in the city of Denver in exclusionary single family zoning, which results in all other land use, is competing for sites in the remaining 23% of land\nSpeaker 1: in the city. The city of Denver.\nSpeaker 2: Estimates there are 46,000 residents who are extremely burdened.\nSpeaker 1: Paying 50% or more.\nSpeaker 2: Of their income.\nSpeaker 1: In housing. This probably Denver Post from 2017 to 2021. Denver built 5120 apartments each year at that rate. If expanding housing affordability results in an average of 10% affordable units. It will take 92 years to provide these 46,000 residents with affordable housing.\nSpeaker 1: Given all of these factors, Denver needs an explosion of housing, construction of various types, housing costs in every neighborhood throughout the city. It is the only way to respond to the housing crisis and why the staff supports this project.\nSpeaker 1: It's great to see so many positive comments from the community. I ask the city council vote to approve this project.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. The next person online is Corey Pro Basco.\nSpeaker 1: Hi. Thank you, city council for the opportunity to comment. My name is Cord Roberts, going to resident of the 2500 block of Lawrence Street and a direct neighbor to the property under consideration. I just want to raise a specific concern about this request as it currently stands.\nSpeaker 1: A request for utilize the PD zoning to provide for site specific zoning to the properties in question. My concern is that there are two main properties of land involved in this request and the smaller portion of land called Suburbia D is being dragged along in the process with the bigger portion, yet presents its own unique issues and\nSpeaker 1: challenges that aren't fully being considered or address with the larger portion the developers who own and control the whole city block. So we're access the flexibility to work with the city during site development review to better mitigate any impacts.\nSpeaker 1: Subsidy is different. It's separated from the larger project by a public right of way. It sits on a different block, one that has existing residential and commercial properties that will be affected. If we're considering a mechanism to provide for Cypress specific zoning in this case, then please take it a step further and really consider the impact of\nSpeaker 1: that zoning on the smaller site and the block around it. Subsidy should be considered in and of itself separate from the larger parcel. So Brady will occupy. A third of the block will have an impact greater than all of the properties on the remaining two thirds of the block combined.\nSpeaker 1: Given the limited time here, I'm going to highlight one example in that all existing residential properties on this block are completely and wholly dependent upon an alley that services the block for their only ingress and egress to parking, as.\nSpeaker 7: Well as trash collection.\nSpeaker 1: And other services. Commercial properties on land will also have to utilize the alley if the rezoning of security is approved, the developers plan to add an additional 80 or 200 more parking spaces. So at least 8100 more vehicles plus additional delivery collection and other services with only access will still also only be through that alley.\nSpeaker 1: That's a 200% increase now, though, uses with no mechanism to mitigate the impact on an alley that was designed for service according to the block as originally planned and is only just sufficient for the block is currently sort of.\nSpeaker 1: My understanding is that Doty won't allow for new development to directly access any of the adjacent streets. So I don't believe the issues that it can be effectively mitigated with the density that this that would be allowed out of this request approval without more fully considering the impacts at the smallest like just kicks this can down the\nSpeaker 1: road and creates a potential untenable and unresolvable problem with the city. Existing residents and or potential new neighbors will be left to deal with for the future. The specifics matter if the increased housing and commercial density that's.\nSpeaker 7: Caused.\nSpeaker 1: By this causes an over demand out the existing infrastructure. We, as we can likely expect to see here, it'll cause issues not just for current residents and visitors, but also our new residents who likely won't.\nSpeaker 7: Fully realize this until they've moved.\nSpeaker 1: In. And you have to live with the impacts every day. That's a disservice.\nSpeaker 7: To current residents and our future.\nSpeaker 1: Neighbors. If there's a way to approve this without including sobriety, I'd fully encourage that. In lieu of that, I.\nSpeaker 7: Respectfully request that you deny this request for now and encourage the developer.\nSpeaker 1: To work with all involved, to modify the request to better mitigate the negative impacts of the development that would be allowed and subverted under this request. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Ryan Kinney.\nSpeaker 1: Oh. My name's Ryan Kinney. I am board president of Yimby, Denver, and I live in District ten Capital Hill neighborhood. I think this rezoning is a no brainer and ticks every box of what you could ask for. It is situated within a lively mixed use corridor along Blake, Walnut and Larimer streets between lower downtown.\nSpeaker 6: And the 38th and Blake Station area across the street from the Denver Central.\nSpeaker 1: Market. This is the perfect place for our highly amenity, mid-rise density proposed by the developer. This will provide much needed diversely priced homes and unique commercial spaces in a central and highly walkable area. Future tenants and current Denver residents, including myself, stand to benefit.\nSpeaker 1: I always welcome exciting destinations to visit in my city and new residents in our neighborhood, in our neighborhoods to patronize local businesses. Projects like this are critical to reducing automobile dependance and relieving pressure.\nSpeaker 8: On our exploding housing market.\nSpeaker 1: On behalf of both myself and of Jimmy Denver, I ask you to please support this rezoning. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Fatuma. Here we have Fatuma virtually with us. Okay. All right. We're going to go ahead and move back into chambers. Gerald Horner.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. My name is Gerald Horner. I live in the Curtis Park neighborhood of Five Points, and I'm here to speak in support of this project. This development is an example of smart density, reducing our reliance on cars while providing desperately needed workforce housing.\nSpeaker 1: Additionally, I serve on the Transportation and Safety Committee for Curtis Park Neighbors. Edens has been extremely responsive and has made adjustments to the current plan based on feedback from the community, specifically how traffic is routed away from the residential portion of the neighborhood, how vehicles access the underground parking and for service and delivery needs.\nSpeaker 1: We also appreciate that Edens has been proactive in securing additional parking at the Rockies parking lot and continues to look for ways to direct visitors to parking for parking outside the residential area. Edens has also been a partner in broader discussions around safer mobility and parking infrastructure for the greater.\nSpeaker 6: Five Points neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you again. Please vote yes tonight in favor of the zoning change.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Eileen Feltman. So Eileen Feltman. Yes. Okay. No worries. Well, we'll ask our producers to go ahead, please. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Eileen Saltman, and I live within about 400 feet from this proposed development. I've been a resident of Curtis Park for 43 years, and I stand in strong opposition to this proposed rezoning that would allow five and seven stories on Larimer Street.\nSpeaker 1: And five stories on.\nSpeaker 2: Lawrence Street. I would like to agree with the the resident of the 2500 block of Lawrence Street. Subsection D should not be our section due. Should not be included in this. All the houses, all the everything on the 2500 block of Lawrence Street is 100% residential, consisting of single family homes, small, three storey condominium buildings and three\nSpeaker 2: storey townhomes. That really that segment should be handled by itself. It is not appropriate for the part of this request. I believe that the proposed title, although the general concept of the development.\nSpeaker 1: I am.\nSpeaker 2: In support of, I.\nSpeaker 1: Firmly.\nSpeaker 2: Opposed to it and request that you deny it based on that it really is not an appropriate use of a p you d filing each of these sub areas can be addressed with the current zoning. One thing is proposed heights are not appropriate, are not supported by nor consistent with our Northeast Neighborhood Plan, which is due to\nSpeaker 2: three stories. Currently, the majority of them are IMAX three or Jimmu three, which, if they include 10% affordable housing as they're being offered, each of those can go up to four stories with the new proposed affordability. This developer is not giving anything more than 10%.\nSpeaker 2: Yet they're asking for five stories inappropriately on Lawrence, five stories on the 2500 block of Lerma Street and five and seven stories on the 2600 block of Larimer. But they're not offering more than 10%, 60% ammo. They are not offering.\nSpeaker 1: Additional.\nSpeaker 2: Affordable units available for home ownership. Income, restricted homeownership to add stability and to the neighborhood and opportunities for wealth building. The I so I just don't understand why when other developers will get a higher.\nSpeaker 1: Incentive to for.\nSpeaker 2: For offering 10%. Why should the city be granting these developers five and seven when they're not offering more? They're they're just not. The proposed grocery store are. The other things they think that would be important is.\nSpeaker 1: Issues.\nSpeaker 2: About safety. The loading of a grocery store on 26 and Lawrence would be inappropriate and of safety issues there privatizing the alley. It will no longer be a place that can.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Stuart Zoll.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, City Council. My name is Stuart Zoll, the president and founder of Denver, based and rhino based all commercial real estate. I'm here to speak.\nSpeaker 6: In support of the rezoning. And if you look at.\nSpeaker 1: Some of the great retail nodes.\nSpeaker 8: Across the country, it's all about.\nSpeaker 1: Having a critical.\nSpeaker 8: Mass of retail.\nSpeaker 1: Integrated with mixed use.\nSpeaker 6: Of housing and affordable housing. And right.\nSpeaker 1: Now.\nSpeaker 6: The demand in Rhino for retail.\nSpeaker 1: Is off the charts, but there's no place to put them. So what?\nSpeaker 6: EDENS Coming in and being able to create more.\nSpeaker 1: Retail, it will create a much better.\nSpeaker 6: Shopping environment and will create more sales tax revenue for the city.\nSpeaker 1: Right now, they've done a.\nSpeaker 6: Fantastic job with outdoor brands from Burton to Patagonia, and Rhino is getting.\nSpeaker 1: National recognition. However, the other brands that want to come in.\nSpeaker 6: First to market, they're not even talking about other parts of Denver. They want to be in Rhino. There's no place to put them. So I love their plan. I hope you will support it. It's good for Rhino and it's good for Denver and good for Colorado.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Sue Glass Smucker. I'm sorry if I missed pronounce your name. And then our last person in person and then we're going to transition to virtually is Donna Goucher is me. So go ahead, please.\nSpeaker 2: Oh. Um, Sue Glass, smoker. I live in Curtis Park, and I've been a long term resident there. I'm concerned. I am opposed to this project because I'm concerned more about the character of Curtis Park. We're an unusual neighborhood, surrounded completely by commercial and busy streets.\nSpeaker 1: And.\nSpeaker 2: Welton Street, Park Avenue and Larimer and Reno. Y'know, is like a monster right now. It's exploding and it eats up everything around it. And it start to eat up in Curtis Park. And, you know, we've seen it go to certain things.\nSpeaker 3: How do you do that?\nSpeaker 2: We've seen it go into coal mining, going to coal and such like that. Now it's all right. Why not just gets bigger and bigger? I don't want to be part of that. I know. And because we have such a distinct personality, being the oldest street car neighborhood in Denver, which houses the first park in the game in\nSpeaker 2: Denver Public Park. So I think that this isn't a bad plan. It's just in the wrong spot and it's coming in to Curtis Park. Our neighborhood plan says that three stories and residential. This does not fit the neighborhood plan and blueprint Denver.\nSpeaker 2: You know I shouldn't do that group of. I think this is the parcel that needs to be cleaned up, developed and resolved. But I think it needs to do in response to what our surroundings are. And we're not a five storey neighborhood and there's different ways of doing transitions.\nSpeaker 2: And that was this was all set up in our neighborhood plan. There was a lot of foresight into that. And apparently it has worked extremely well because we haven't had a lot of rezoning, but we certainly have had a boom of a development, including Curtis Park.\nSpeaker 2: So I want to keep Curtis Park and keep the character and I don't want to lose our edges. And this is just, y'know, eating away at us. It's not about a personality. It's not about the project being good or bad.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's good. I think it's in the wrong spot and I think we should follow the process that we were. You should follow your own rules and follow.\nSpeaker 0: Move onto our next speaker. Appreciate it. If a council member questions, they can call you back out.\nSpeaker 2: For the neighborhood plan.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Deonna go, uca.\nSpeaker 3: You got close. All right. Hey, I'm Diana Goucher. I'm at 36 Larimer Street. I've been there since 2013. I'm in support of the project. I'm going to save a lot of comments about Edens and Tom Kyler, which other people will share.\nSpeaker 3: They're fantastic. With more specific focus on the project itself in the Zone. In a previous hearing, you guys were a part of that. A supporter mentioned a 50 minute community, and since COVID 19, we've seen this resurgence and desire for a 15 minute community, which is having accessibility of basic needs within a 15 minute drive.\nSpeaker 3: And 15 minute communities are built on five minute neighborhoods, which is what Ryan was trying to become a five minute neighborhood. Simply put, is making sure that food and necessities are locally available. It's creating green spaces. It's housing people, specifically enough people and a diverse population to frequent and support local businesses.\nSpeaker 3: You have to have people to frequent these businesses, creating walkability and bringing in schools or maintaining schools. The proposed project checks all these boxes Save the Schooling piece, and schools in the area have spoken support in previous hearings for this project.\nSpeaker 3: It's a Suz comment. You know, talking about the streetcar neighborhood, I think the five minute neighborhood concept is trying to bring back sort of the old time concept of local neighborhoods in a new way. And unfortunately, sometimes that comes with higher density, but the benefits of that, I think, greatly outweigh the the offset of traffic and things\nSpeaker 3: that come to the neighborhood. But really trying to create a community and where we have the ability to interact as a community. I truly feel that in today's and today's environment we have so much disconnection and so much uncertainty.\nSpeaker 3: And I think now more than ever, we need a connectivity and we need a community that's going to be able to bring us all back together. And I think creating neighborhoods like this will really accentuate that the proposed rezone will allow this community to grow in a more connected and vibrant way, and I enthusiastically support it.\nSpeaker 3: Thanks for your.\nSpeaker 1: Time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We're going to go back to the Zoom platform. Vanessa Quintanilla. Do we have Vanessa? Nope. Shawn Campbell.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Thank you, council for having us this evening. Or or I guess. Happy first day of summer here at 1203. I am. My name is John Campbell. I'm CEO of Formative. We've been residents in the Reno Arts District for years and have been investors in our little community since 2010.\nSpeaker 1: Co-Founder of Industry Projects on Brighten Up at 38th and Lake Street Station as well, where we're investors long term and really consider ourselves much like Tom in Edens as community builders. I think what Edens is proposing and we're in strong favor of is really helping to build a vibrant community that's starting to grow.\nSpeaker 1: You know, this is our old warehouse district that's been surrounded by really great historic communities that continue to thrive as well. But our retail sector and what is happening along Larimer, Walnut and Blake Street are important and supporting that through, you know, higher density and thoughtful development in design and architecture and planning is important.\nSpeaker 1: Denver's become a really modern city. A lot of folks, as we all know, want to move here. That provides pressure on affordability, housing, job creation, education. It goes down the list. But what's important is that we're listening to each other and working together.\nSpeaker 1: And I think that's what Tom and Edens has done very thoughtfully in his community meetings, in his outreach. I know that we've shared simple things like trying to get trash cans on the street and rhino, which was a big win for me when I was part of the rhino, our board, and getting crosswalks and stop signs at\nSpeaker 1: dangerous intersections. So it's not all about density. Tom and Edens are community builders. They're here to stay. They've invested a lot in the community, much like ourselves. I think that their design and their thoughtfulness about utilitarian, retail and the blend of national and.\nSpeaker 8: Local retailers is.\nSpeaker 1: Important. But their affordability at 10% at 68. Mine is a lot more than other developers and other projects that have got approved, and I think they should be commended for that. I think we need to be thoughtful that as our city grows to get affordability, that we're going to have to get dense and density is is going\nSpeaker 1: to provide us the.\nSpeaker 8: Ability to.\nSpeaker 1: Provide other forms of housing and affordability that we don't currently have. So I'm fully in favor of this. I support what they've been doing to date at Denver Central Market and in the neighborhood. And I think that they're going to do an incredible job going forward.\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for your time.\nSpeaker 0: You. Our next speaker is Hugo Quintana. And I had them virtually. Do we have you go now? Okay. And then we have Hugo. Canton Junior had them in chambers. Okay. Looks like we don't have them with us. All Watson.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Darryl Watson. Good morning.\nSpeaker 8: Members of council. I'm a 30 year resident of Denver. I reside in the Whittier neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: I'm here to.\nSpeaker 8: Speak in favor and ask the Denver City Council to.\nSpeaker 6: Approve the.\nSpeaker 8: Creation of this custom body.\nSpeaker 1: Be reticent of me not to, you know, speak to the folks.\nSpeaker 8: Who are here tonight. I'm really not in favor because of their perceptions that the pretty varied building heights and mixed use ground floor in Lawrence does not exactly reflect the 2011 Northeast Downtown Neighborhood Plans maps. I respect the folks who are here and speaking to that.\nSpeaker 1: Point as a foreman or president.\nSpeaker 8: In this city council district.\nSpeaker 1: I would carefully their primary concern.\nSpeaker 8: With the extensive community process by Curtis Park, our neighbors, and a final position of support by super majority of the iron ore board. They looked at that possible question between Blueprint Denver as well as between the neighborhood and area plan, and they came through a decision to support this process.\nSpeaker 8: The Arnaud's support for this is consistent with their.\nSpeaker 1: Past support for other nearby rezonings.\nSpeaker 8: Along Lawrence that work together to create a special node here, incorporating mixed use while being primarily residential. This custom PUD request meets the review criteria. I encourage Denver City Council to vote yes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Julie Roop from. And then after Juli, we have Javon Taylor. Go ahead, please.\nSpeaker 2: Hi. City council members. This is probably the latest state up in five years. So excuse my scattered. My name is Julie Reuben. Some. I live at 2800 Curtis Street. I stand in opposition to this project. My main three concerns are the height, the height and public safety.\nSpeaker 2: We have been relying on the area plan for years and if it's outdated, we didn't have a chance. We weren't privy to any any constellation made on that plan. We didn't expect the planning board to suddenly say that doesn't count and blueprint Denver does.\nSpeaker 2: We had enjoyed our three stories. It's consistent with the transition into Reno. It's consistent for Larimer and Laurence Streets. The one of the greatest benefits about Denver. It's a city of sunshine and mountains. Which I'm sorry I'm using this, which adds immeasurably to the quality of life on a daily basis.\nSpeaker 2: These heights will deny any views from the enjoining properties and will cast a little more into the shadows. Further, this project awaits public safety in the area. Too many cars, trucks, scooters, pedestrians, electric bikes, regular bikes, skateboards, busses, motorcycles, Ubers lifts.\nSpeaker 2: And let's not leave out petty caps, tech trucks and our famous banjo, Billy's pedal bars. The noise and jumble of multi-modal vehicles will not only impair quality, but also our safety and sanity. There will not be adequate parking for the residents and patrons of the proposed retail and housing, which will further, further erode our precious quality of\nSpeaker 2: life. I urge you to deny this application and to restore the integrity of the area plan which has served us so well. Thank you for listening.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is John Taylor.\nSpeaker 1: Everybody. I'm John Taylor here representing Green Spaces, the new CEO on Earth and Green Space is a proud community partner of this project. Historically, Green Spaces has been a coworking space. We're positioning more as a community hub where.\nSpeaker 7: We give small businesses, local artists.\nSpeaker 1: Community members resources as well as opportunities. And in our release, our relationship with Edens has lasted over the last two years.\nSpeaker 7: It started with Tom giving me an opportunity to open up my first retail store, and from there I built to coordinating different urban restoration projects, adding more greenery to the range of five points area.\nSpeaker 1: And now we're coordinating the incubator program where we're giving small businesses access to.\nSpeaker 7: Retail space and.\nSpeaker 1: Resources in an area where many can't afford to be. So I think this project really addresses a lot of huge needs the community needs as far as like retaining talent, as far as community development, as well as, like I said, allowing.\nSpeaker 7: Small businesses, minority owned.\nSpeaker 1: Businesses, opportunity to occupy a space where it allows small businesses who can't afford to be in. But beyond that, you know, I think this project really addresses the urban like urban heat island effect, you know, with adding more green spaces to the area as well as providing grocery stores in a food desert.\nSpeaker 1: And I think Tom has done is due diligence and getting the necessary and proper community partners to really make this project something really special and something transformational for the area. And I hope you guys vote yes. Mike Evans.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is a really Joe Martinez. And just to let folks know after a really so we're going to go back to the virtual platform and we have Ali Duncan. But go ahead, Mr. Martinez.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, everyone. My name is Leo Martinez and I do live in Curtis Park. Lived there all my life. I want to start with the blueprint, Denver, because this is the criteria Edens used to justify submitting their application for 3D blueprint.\nSpeaker 1: Denver is clearly being used as a loophole by Edens in order to get their application approved. Blueprint Denver Focus Group at Denver's Focus and goal is to have Denver neighborhoods have a plan in place. Here's a quote from Blueprint Denver that the Neighborhood Planning Initiative provides the greatest opportunity for covering all of Denver with small area plans\nSpeaker 1: that provide more specific guidance than Blueprint in Denver. When you read Blueprint in Denver, you will see it focuses on the need for every neighborhood in Denver to put together a neighborhood plan blueprint. Denver indicates that when a neighborhood plan is in place, developers should adhere to the guidelines and meet the criteria of the neighborhood plan.\nSpeaker 1: I have in my hand the 73 of northeast downtown neighborhood plan. That's specifically sets the criteria for three story building height. On the blocks, Aiden is requesting five and seven story buildings. The criteria and guidelines within northeast downtown Denver plans are extremely vital for the safety and public welfare of its residents.\nSpeaker 1: The truth. Traffic alone that Eden's project will bring to the neighborhood creates a dangerous situation for residents, especially for children and parents. Walking to university prep elementary school two blocks away, ongoing street edens ignored northeast Denver northeast downtown neighborhood plans and instead went to select two selected residents with a display of bell bells and whistles in hopes\nSpeaker 1: of gathering support for the project development. It's not hard to impress people when you show them a Bugatti while they drive a Ford Fiesta. A few Curtis Park residents took to the streets and knocked on doors in a couple of weekends and collected 107 signatures in opposition surpassing surpassing the signature of support.\nSpeaker 1: Eden's development does not meet the zoning criteria and is not consistent with the Northeast. Then downtown neighborhood plan heights and where will represent and will present an extreme danger to the safety and the public welfare of nearby residents.\nSpeaker 1: With increased traffic on Lawrence and Raphael, as well as increased traffic through adjacent neighborhoods, I pray and hope City Council members see that this application does not meet the meet your criteria in order to move forward with approval and hope using this application.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Ali Duncan.\nSpeaker 3: Hi. Thanks for having me on. My name is Ali Duncan and I am born.\nSpeaker 2: In.\nSpeaker 3: Colorado, born and raised. And I also own a property and a business on Walton Street. And I am the president of the Heart of Five Points Neighborhood Association. I am so excited about this project and being a part.\nSpeaker 2: Of the conversation. Working with Tom.\nSpeaker 3: Keller and Green Spaces with Javon to start to bring greenery into the neighborhood has been really enjoyable.\nSpeaker 2: For just not Walton Street, but also moving.\nSpeaker 3: Into Larimer to see what they're doing and then connecting all the neighborhoods together. So it's so important to me being a black female business owner and property owner in Denver, to have a company that supports the marginalized community.\nSpeaker 3: So five points is a historical black district.\nSpeaker 2: And to go back and look over all the changes that have been made.\nSpeaker 3: It's so refreshing to have a company that comes in to support black women's businesses and the Bipoc community. So I am thrilled to be.\nSpeaker 0: Supporting.\nSpeaker 3: This project and I hope that everyone at the Council will also do the same and see the importance of it also.\nSpeaker 2: So thank you so much for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Next up, we have LaFleur Kevin.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. My name is Kevin McClure. I live at 34th and Larimer. I know it, but this is 2013. I'm the president of our. We're a group of 11 townhomes there at the corner of 34th and Larimer. And I actually submitted a petition in opposition.\nSpeaker 7: Signed by all 11 homeowners of our complex in opposition of this development.\nSpeaker 1: First, I want to say we are not anti-development. And speaking for myself, the reason I move to right now is because I could see what it was going to be. I am pleasantly.\nSpeaker 7: Surprised where it is and I can't.\nSpeaker 1: Wait to see what it's going to become. I have no plans of moving in either to any of my neighbors within a one.\nSpeaker 7: Block radius of us. Right now there is a 12.\nSpeaker 1: Story apartment building that has.\nSpeaker 8: Broken ground, an eight storey office building and a three story hotel.\nSpeaker 1: We're in favor of all of them. But this corridor, Larimer, Laurence, where it's butting up against the historical neighborhood, the transitional street, to the more commercial zone of Reno, we feel is special. We feel that if this goes to seven stories beyond the IMAX three three story, now that every single developer coming in from here on out\nSpeaker 1: is going to point to this development and.\nSpeaker 7: Try to emulate not only.\nSpeaker 1: These heights, but even go go higher. And what would the reasoning be that they couldn't do that if they got this seven story building in there on Larimer Street? It's again, we're not anti-development. It seems like a really wonderful project.\nSpeaker 1: Everything they're bringing in and the people that have worked with this.\nSpeaker 8: Developer.\nSpeaker 1: Before have nothing but glowing things to say. So I.\nSpeaker 7: Assume everything that I've.\nSpeaker 1: Heard is a wonderful.\nSpeaker 7: Conscientious developer, but not at this block, not at this neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: The zoning that had been determined with this image three in Larimer is a is a transitional street between Curtis Park and Rhino has obviously done really well. I mean, nobody can say that Larimer and Rhino has hindered any growth.\nSpeaker 7: And what is also nice is that.\nSpeaker 1: The people in Curtis Hart were in some some of those homes along the 130 year plus old homes that they have lives and that their lifestyle is maintained if buildings go above three and.\nSpeaker 7: Four and five stories.\nSpeaker 1: Along that corridor, what about these people who live there? They can't garden because they're literally in the shadows.\nSpeaker 7: And their lifestyle is, you know, is it's a detrimental effect.\nSpeaker 1: So we are in opposition for those reasons. And we hope that you vote in our favor in opposition.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Our next speaker is Alan Balfe, and we're going to.\nSpeaker 1: Go back to that. Had. Excuse me. I was born.\nSpeaker 8: Raised.\nSpeaker 1: And have resided in my entire life here in Denver. My wife and I have owned our.\nSpeaker 8: Business and Commercial Property.\nSpeaker 1: Studio to be a retail furniture showroom located at 2527 Larimer.\nSpeaker 8: Street.\nSpeaker 1: For the last 14 years. Our building sits across from the street from both of the parcels under redevelopment consideration. One of the parcels, which is directly across the street from our building and is located between 25th and 26th Street.\nSpeaker 1: Currently the property has three old, blighted, decrepit and unusable structures that have seen better times, including the now vacant.\nSpeaker 8: IMAX laboratory.\nSpeaker 1: Building on the north end. A turn of the century, vacant, boarded up house in the middle of the parcel, and to the south.\nSpeaker 8: Sits an old.\nSpeaker 1: Two storey brick building that's been long vacant, is structurally unsound and dangerous, and with a roof that is on the verge of.\nSpeaker 8: Completely collapsing.\nSpeaker 1: Is a serious.\nSpeaker 8: And imminent danger.\nSpeaker 1: To the public. Frankly, I, as well as my neighbors, are surprised that this structure has never been condemned. And ordered by the city building department to be demolished. These three structures serve no useful purpose and are beyond any consideration of thoughtful restoration.\nSpeaker 1: They only.\nSpeaker 7: Exist as an eyesore to the public.\nSpeaker 1: And surrounding neighborhood and have long been a nuisance. Properties. The property has been a lightning rod for illicit criminal conduct, including but not limited to drug dealing.\nSpeaker 8: Vagrancy.\nSpeaker 1: Violence and vandalism. Additionally, and most recently, among other infractions.\nSpeaker 8: An attempted arson that occurred last year.\nSpeaker 1: On December 31st, which the Denver district attorney attorney's office is now investigating. This ongoing and unchecked criminal activity.\nSpeaker 8: Has negatively affected our.\nSpeaker 1: Business and adjacent neighborhood associations for the last 14.\nSpeaker 8: Years and needs.\nSpeaker 1: To change. In conclusion, the proposed project will be a welcome change and proof and prove to be a modern, comprehensive and thoughtful urban design plan for the betterment of the neighborhood and surrounding areas. Meeting the Goals and Visions of Blueprint Denver.\nSpeaker 1: I sincerely believe that if approved, this project will serve as inspiration for other communities and youths and municipalities and will be emulated here and abroad. I respectfully.\nSpeaker 8: Ask that the council moves.\nSpeaker 1: To approve the Five Points.\nSpeaker 8: Larimer and Lawrence Project.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Q Our next speaker is Bill West.\nSpeaker 2: I'm slow.\nSpeaker 1: A little out of the.\nSpeaker 2: Politicians.\nSpeaker 1: It was for my opposition related to a quotation, but my recent article in Westword, in which Tom Tyler sets forth his companies argument for Eaton Peabody. One of the very small part of that is that these are Tom kind of words.\nSpeaker 1: Our argument, that is Aden's argument obviously, is what better place to bring more stuff to? You're on Larry Street, which is one of the major transportation corridors. You should be bringing density to places like that. So Edens will bring will provide.\nSpeaker 0: More stuff.\nSpeaker 1: And density and in the process, overturn height restrictions set by current neighborhood plans instead of three stories on Larimer. It will be allowed to build to seven stories and on Lawrence and instead of three stories to five. Furthermore, the period will allow will allow Edens to change the zoning of one full half block of lawns from residential\nSpeaker 1: to commercial so that a grocery store, a hardware store, etc. could be put in place. Lawrence, I would remind you, is a two lane street. One lane in each direction. Grocery stores and hardware stores need to be restocked routinely, which means truck traffic as well as customer traffic on top of local traffic, causing safety, pollution and quality\nSpeaker 1: of life issues for residents of Lawrence, as well as for those living in the immediate vicinity of historic Curtis Park. Allowing an aggressive developer like Edens, the headquarters in Washington, D.C., to come to Denver and set new zoning regulations designed to benefit corporate interests, sets a dangerous precedent with almost certain negative consequences for both Lawrence Lawrence Corridor\nSpeaker 1: and the KURTIS Park neighborhood. We urge you not to approve of this feud. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is in person is Brian Cox and wanted to let folks know that from this point forward in the public hearing, all of the speakers have checked that they are for this item. So we have 25 more speakers.\nSpeaker 0: And so of the 25 speakers, take all 3 minutes. We're going to be here about 75 minutes. So just want to encourage folks again, if you feel like you're repeating what somebody said or or just the same briefing, your comments would be much appreciated.\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead, please, sir.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. My name is Brian Cox. I live in Curtis Park and serve as president of Curtis Park Neighbors and represent our board tonight, which has voted to support the rezoning proposal. Two points I wanted to speak to the Curtis Park neighbors process and feedback of neighbors and a particular item of the rezoning criteria items.\nSpeaker 1: First, the first neighborhood more than a year ago to share their vision. They presented a multiple CPE and board meetings and general meetings, hosted multiple open houses, met with specific groups such as Park, which is equal to the site as well as many one on one.\nSpeaker 1: Such were their existing properties and their plans solicited feedback from neighbors via a letter and a meeting that was held in person as well as available via Zoom. In the end, 71 neighbors supported support for the proposal, 13 were opposed and nine undecided, three of which were leaning towards support.\nSpeaker 1: While not unanimous, we felt feedback was heavily in favor of supporting the proposal. Neighbors cited many of the things we've talked about as reasons for support for housing. Neighborhood survey. Retail. Such as a grocery. Residential. Live work units.\nSpeaker 1: A Lawrence interactive open space through the interior of the project. Substantial parking and the use of a pool to ensure that the development of this particular proposed project has benefits. This brings us to the second point, which is the first item on the rezoning criteria consistency with adopted plans.\nSpeaker 1: I think this is one of the more controversial topics for this particular proposal. It states the proposed official map and then it is consistent with the city's adopted plans for the proposed rezoning is necessary to provide land for a community need that was not anticipated at the time of adoption.\nSpeaker 1: The city's plan. I believe in this case. This proposal meets both of these criteria from the adopted neighborhood plans. Land Use Concept Section. Urban residential neighborhoods are higher density, primarily residential, but may include a noteworthy number of complementary commercial uses in northeast downtown.\nSpeaker 1: Urban residential uses tend to be located in areas that transition from historic residential neighborhoods to more intense mixed use neighborhoods. A mixture of housing types is present, including historic single family houses, townhouses, small multi-family apartments and sometimes mid to high rise residential structures.\nSpeaker 1: Per the map attached to the neighborhood plan, the Lawrence Corridor is identified as an urban residential area, as a as a the second half of the criteria, while the neighborhood plan height guidelines generally call for three stories in this area of the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: For context, the Northeast Neighborhood Plan was adopted in 2011, although not anticipated at the time the plan was adopted. This area has organically evolved into the commercial and retail hub of the neighborhood at the intersection of multimodal transportation, with 26th Street as a designated bikeway, 27th as a designated pedestrian walkway and public transportation.\nSpeaker 1: A lot of the community feedback clearly spoke to the need this project fills, which was not envisioned five years ago. In addition to the previously stated benefits of the project cited by neighbors, Edens as recently committed to a small business incubator program and artist residency exchange program and even more affordable housing, with at least 10% of units\nSpeaker 1: at a max of 60% and by more than would be required by the expanding housing for housing affordability time lot.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Kim Choi.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, City Council members my name is Tim Choi, previous owner, family owner with Jose Liquors. I am in support for this change of zoning. I love the development of Edens. We worked closely with them to sell our business and we got to see the plans ahead.\nSpeaker 1: I think it's very thoughtful. They are all about diversity, inclusion, and I am quite. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you. Keith Pryor is our next speaker, followed by John Hayden.\nSpeaker 1: Good morning, counsel. Thank you so much for staying with us. Keith Pryor, Curtis Park, neighbors live on 24th in Tampa in support at this time has been amazing. This project, as we talk about does meet the criteria. And I want to address a couple of different things on one to the conflict between Blueprint Denver and the Northeast\nSpeaker 1: area plan. So yes, it is called out for three stories, but in that northeast area plan, it does call out for having other community benefits. And this project has significant community benefits, outdoor open space. It is also one of the other pieces that I want to address is the pod.\nSpeaker 1: And so this project if it were to go straight zoning into today's IMAX CMCs three, five, eight with the new affordable housing, they would be able to get the additional floor height because they are providing the affordable housing component.\nSpeaker 1: But what this Pudi does is it allows for setbacks. And the setbacks are critical because it transitions and it recesses to deal with light issues and how it impacts the adjacent neighborhoods. And also through having the setbacks and through having the Pudi allows it to basically say they're setting a very high bar.\nSpeaker 1: And so this is not a precedent setting rezoning. If others along the corridor want to provide the amount of extra care and thought and open space and affordability and workforce housing and setbacks, then yes, I think that that is very worth wanting to see if we want to allow these extra heights along the corridor, given the additional\nSpeaker 1: community benefits that this project is bringing forth for our community, and why we and why I am supporting it is because it does bring forth all of these additional community benefits which the Northeast Area plan would allow for and does want additional heights because it is bringing these community benefits forward.\nSpeaker 1: We are entering into a community benefit agreement with Edens as a part of this program, and so I encourage you to support this project because not only does it check all the boxes, not only does it do a lot of benefits for Bipoc community, it really goes above and beyond.\nSpeaker 1: And so those precedent settings, I would love to see it if they want to bring this on throughout the corridor for all of the community benefits, I would be more supportive. I would love to see this duplicated because it is such a great community and it is really raising the bar for a rezoning.\nSpeaker 1: So I do support this and I encourage you to as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker is John Hayden.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Good morning. Members of.\nSpeaker 2: Council, thank you.\nSpeaker 1: For your time. My name is John Hayden.\nSpeaker 2: I live at 24th in Tampa.\nSpeaker 1: I'm a long term resident of Curtis Park neighborhood. I'm here in enthusiastic support of this rezoning. And the one thing.\nSpeaker 2: I think.\nSpeaker 1: I could add that hasn't been said already is you're hearing a lot of fear about density and high impact on traffic and tall buildings on the Curtis Park neighborhood. I love Curtis Park dearly, and I.\nSpeaker 2: Work every day for that.\nSpeaker 1: Neighborhood. And I believe that the transition from the two story neighborhood to a Larimer is really appropriate. It's very gradual. It goes from two stories in the neighborhood, up to three stories across Arapahoe, up to four stories at the far end of Arapahoe, and finally up to Larimer, where it reaches five and seven.\nSpeaker 1: And that's an appropriate gradation.\nSpeaker 2: That.\nSpeaker 1: Respects.\nSpeaker 2: The historic district.\nSpeaker 1: In terms of traffic. This project that's being proposed is.\nSpeaker 2: Nowhere.\nSpeaker 1: Near as.\nSpeaker 2: Large as the projects we've already seen built.\nSpeaker 1: On our east side on.\nSpeaker 2: Welton Street.\nSpeaker 1: And those projects had not resulted in.\nSpeaker 2: Incredible.\nSpeaker 1: Traffic and crowds and accidents and dangerous situations. So I don't see why this smaller project would cause any danger.\nSpeaker 2: To our.\nSpeaker 1: Neighborhood. I think it will bring us great benefit and I hope that you'll approve it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Amy Meyer. And it doesn't look like we have Amy with us. All right, Bill Mushkin. It doesn't look like we have Bill with us, Charlie Billingsley. All right. Doesn't look like Charlie. You're accepting the promotion that our producers are trying to give you.\nSpeaker 0: So we'll come back to you, Charlie.\nSpeaker 2: We.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: We'll see where we're at with that. Chris Riddell.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, it looks. It looks like.\nSpeaker 2: Awesome. I'm here. So my name is Charlie Billingsley, founder of the Museum for Black Girls and Culture Museum, which is.\nSpeaker 1: Right in the corner of.\nSpeaker 2: 26th and Walnut Behind Voice Box. I'm also a Denver native. I grew up about 10 minutes away from this historical area, so I'm really familiar with all of the changes that have kind of happened over the years. Edens and Tom Tyler have been essential to revitalizing the five points and bringing vibrancy to this community.\nSpeaker 2: They have also been essential in providing.\nSpeaker 1: Opportunities and spaces.\nSpeaker 2: To small, minority and women owned businesses, which was not easily.\nSpeaker 1: Accessible prior.\nSpeaker 2: To this. Through Edens.\nSpeaker 1: We specifically have been able to.\nSpeaker 2: Expand our reach to impact the community in Denver through our museum, as well as expand to other markets and cities. And the pandemic caused us to close our business in 2020. So without Edens, we would have never been able to reopen our doors again and grow as vastly and as quickly as we have.\nSpeaker 2: I think this speaks to Eton's character. They are truly a unique company that cares about the city of Denver, its residents, artists, businesses, and the sustainability.\nSpeaker 1: For small businesses.\nSpeaker 2: They have done an amazing job building trust and connection in our community, and as.\nSpeaker 1: Denver has quickly.\nSpeaker 2: Grown, it's important for the city to grow with that as well. So I'm of this. I am in favor and in support of the concept and hope that you guys will vote yes as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Our next speaker is. Chris. Right down.\nSpeaker 1: Good morning. I'll keep it quick. I've been resident rhino and five points for nine years. Same neighborhood go from 100% industrial to 95 plus percent. Next use.\nSpeaker 8: Walks my daughter down 26th street for four years and 26.\nSpeaker 1: Walnut and I think that particular area. Is in dire need of activation.\nSpeaker 7: Additionally, neighborhood retail.\nSpeaker 1: Malls, I think, would dramatically reduce traffic. We are one car, family, two kids, and I am musically in support.\nSpeaker 8: Of obedience and the.\nSpeaker 1: Reason. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Our next speaker is Crystal Whitney.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Yes, we can.\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead. Good morning, City Council. My name is Chris Whitney and I'm an attorney at Raytheon, Mohammed VI, and we're located on 27th and Lawrence, which is right across the street from the proposed development site. And I'm here today to offer my support for Eton's rezoning and development proposal.\nSpeaker 1: I sincerely believe this project would be a valuable addition to our neighborhood. The project will provide much needed retail that will serve the community. It'll also provide a lot more parking. One of the things that I also support about this project is that it incorporates minority owned and women owned businesses.\nSpeaker 1: And which I feel is very important for such a diverse community. This project will also support the work of local artists, which is fitting for the area which is becoming known for its vibrant street art. This project's an important step forward to support and preserve our local businesses and artists of color something we need more than ever\nSpeaker 1: . In the Five Points and Denver as a whole. The most important aspect of Eden's proposal will be the much needed affordable housing that this project will provide. If there's one thing the city needs, it's more affordable housing. So all these components help our neighborhood thrive and grow while also embracing and preserving the important cultural diversity that the\nSpeaker 1: community is known for around the city. So I support this proposal because I believe it will be it will be something that will be special for the neighborhood. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Q Our next speaker is in person and chambers. Alexis Healey.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, council members. My name is Alexis Healey. I am a CPA and I am a homeowner in Reno. This Larimer Laurence project will be right across the street from my home. My quality of life is greatly enhanced by the walkability of Denver.\nSpeaker 3: I walk a mile downtown to work and back. I walk about a mile to Holy Ghost Church for Mass on Sunday, and I walk to Safeway and carry groceries home. I also walk the vibrant street of Larimer and go to the bars, restaurants and local shops.\nSpeaker 3: I believe wholeheartedly that this project will elevate my quality of life further with additional commercial development. And all of this will be right across the street from my home and not a mile away. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Dr. Maly Reddy.\nSpeaker 2: Do we do? We will do.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. It sounds like Dr.. Ready? You need to accept the promotion from our producers. We'll go ahead and move on. Jason Maple. We don't have Jason with us, Joe Walters. Do we have Joe Walters? Okay. Okay. It doesn't look like we've got Dr. Reddy accepting the promotion.\nSpeaker 0: So can we go to Joe?\nSpeaker 1: Joe, I am. I am. Ma'am, this is Dr. Reddy calling from. I'm in Italy right now. I stayed up all night because I wanted to convey my message.\nSpeaker 7: Now and then. I am.\nSpeaker 1: The resident of Cherry Hills and a resident of Colorado for.\nSpeaker 7: 45 years. And I am the.\nSpeaker 1: President of the American Dairy and Food Consulting Labs and Internet.\nSpeaker 7: Media.\nSpeaker 1: Located in Denver.\nSpeaker 7: I'm speaking in favor of the zoning.\nSpeaker 1: Bill for changing the zoning classification. Although I am in Tuscany, Italy, with a time difference of 8 hours from Denver as a citizen of the United States in good.\nSpeaker 7: Standing.\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to give my positive testimony in this regard.\nSpeaker 7: For rezoning for the.\nSpeaker 1: Following reasons. Number one, Tom Keller, the managing director of the agency, is a highly educated Harvard graduate who has a dedicated himself genuinely to improve the Larmour and Laurence Street. Mr. Schuyler has earned the.\nSpeaker 7: Reputation of being an honest gentleman who.\nSpeaker 1: Is down to earth, reliable and honest, because of his caring nature and empathy towards the humanity. Number two, as a president of our company, I ran our business for the past 25 years.\nSpeaker 7: 2558 amnesty, which was not.\nSpeaker 1: Considered as the best.\nSpeaker 7: Secured neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: Because it was.\nSpeaker 7: It was.\nSpeaker 1: Crime oriented at the time. Number three, ever since Eden started.\nSpeaker 7: To revitalize the.\nSpeaker 1: Lorimer and Lawrence Street.\nSpeaker 7: The topography and the landscape of this state totally changed.\nSpeaker 1: Of course, there was a positivity and has been appreciated and applauded. But all the businesspeople and the inhabitants around the Lama and lot number four Indians under the watch of Tom Keller wants to create a business incubator who helps and encourage the woman and to produce and increase the minority business ownership in the area.\nSpeaker 1: Number five. Indians also wants to help the Volunteers of America through infusion of funds and as a joint partner to help the humanity.\nSpeaker 7: Number six He.\nSpeaker 1: Does want and will create affordable housing in the area and also create a 15 minute commute by walk to attend any of the daily chores without having to drive their car to prevent pollution and traffic. Number seven. Considering the 8.6% inflation in the United States, several American citizens need help to cope with the ever increasing housing and\nSpeaker 1: energy costs, etc.. The commitment of.\nSpeaker 7: Regions to install, instill.\nSpeaker 1: Affordable housing and reduction in usage of the gasoline for the cars is a step in the right direction to create comfort and security for the citizens. In addition, it is aim to encourage the artists to have their galleries at an affordable cost in the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 7: And finally, in conclusion.\nSpeaker 0: It looks like we have Gibraltar's with us, Justin Anthony.\nSpeaker 1: Or morning. I am speaking as.\nSpeaker 7: Someone who not only has a child that goes to school in the neighborhood, but.\nSpeaker 1: Also as a business owner who is both having a.\nSpeaker 7: Business directly across from INS and Assist Project as well as to the side of it. And I want to express my strong support of this project because the housing and small business development component.\nSpeaker 1: And it also.\nSpeaker 7: Has the added benefit of offering a wealth of opportunities for.\nSpeaker 1: Local nonprofits, which is something we've always looked for with new.\nSpeaker 7: Additions to the neighborhood. I also genuinely appreciate and what I think has.\nSpeaker 1: Been conveyed by a lot of other people.\nSpeaker 7: The collaborative approach the organization has taken. And just lastly, to be really brief, a lot of people have commented on the potential negative impacts that this may have on US safety. I can tell you, as someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time there and operated there.\nSpeaker 1: That I have seen nothing.\nSpeaker 7: But positive impact on the.\nSpeaker 1: Safety and cleanliness of the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 2: Since it has been.\nSpeaker 7: Involved. And I would highly recommend.\nSpeaker 1: The Council to support this project. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: This is John Dwight.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. And thank you for allowing me to speak tonight. My name is John. Dwight and I live on the 2500 block of Curtis Street. First, I just want to say that I have never seen a more exciting, comprehensive and diverse masterplan such as the Eden's plan for the this block and a half.\nSpeaker 1: Being able to walk to Rhino a couple of blocks and enjoy the restaurants and retail entertainment bars, galleries, just adds to what this neighborhood has gone in the direction of and what it continues to be in a very different way.\nSpeaker 1: This is an NFL development. We need housing in a big, big way. Not only affordable housing, but market rate housing. And this fills that need. This is an area where it goes. I do not believe the density with me being on Curtis Street will be impacted in any way or the height of this project only in a\nSpeaker 1: positive way. Everybody talks about wanting housing, whether it's affordable housing or market rate housing, until it's in their backyard. But we need housing everywhere, and this is the right place for it. It's walkable. It's the right area. It's a growing area.\nSpeaker 1: And I look forward to being able to see the activation that will help with the crime and things that we do experience in some of these areas between Curtis Park and and where this project is occurring. If you just sit back and listen and think about the Volunteers of America CEO comments earlier today or this evening, it\nSpeaker 1: speaks volumes as well as other speakers as to the true inclusionary and diverse project that this will become. A lot of developers at times are looking for things to do to fill the gap, to make this an inclusionary project.\nSpeaker 1: But this is really what they've done been able to do for Volunteers of America and that organization as well as others is really unprecedented. And they've done a heck of a job and would be honored to have the Edens development occur in our neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Our next speaker is Stephen Bennett.\nSpeaker 1: Hey, my name is Stephen Bennett and I live on 29th in California in the historic district. And my prepared remarks sounded exactly like Keith Prior's just less eloquent. So I'm going to second what he said. In all seriousness, I'm very excited about this project Eden's plan, and specifically a small neighborhood grocery store.\nSpeaker 1: My primary mode of transportation is a bicycle. When I do drive in, the city is generally to a grocery store. So as to concerns about traffic, I think it's been mentioned before the 15 minute city, five minute walkable.\nSpeaker 1: For a lot of us in Curtis Park neighborhood, I believe it will cut down on traffic. And finally, I'm very excited for VOA and their ability to if they this goes through and they move headquarters from what I've heard growing the number of meals they serve potentially up to 50%.\nSpeaker 1: But while still maintaining their headquarters in Larimer, where they've had a presence for over 100 years. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Speaker is tie builder. That doesn't look like we have them here. Theresa Ortiz.\nSpeaker 2: Good morning, Kendall.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Teresa Ortiz, and I've been a resident of the 5.30 District neighborhood for 26 years. I grew up in the heart of Reno, off of 36th and Duncan Street, which means I have seen a lot of change over the last two decades.\nSpeaker 3: Much of.\nSpeaker 2: This change being in the form of.\nSpeaker 3: Positive neighborhood development that helps our city grow and thrive. I still live in the Rhino neighborhood and on our property there today, and I'm speaking to offer my support of the Five Points Larimer and.\nSpeaker 2: Lawrence Project.\nSpeaker 3: Proposed by Edens. I can vouch that Edens has been an integral member of our neighborhood, and their purpose of.\nSpeaker 2: Enriching communities is demonstrated every single day by how much they contribute to our.\nSpeaker 3: Community. And right now, as a Latina and business.\nSpeaker 2: Entrepreneur of my own. I also understand and appreciate the importance of creating opportunities for people of color like myself in.\nSpeaker 3: Order to succeed. Edens shares that commitment to create spaces.\nSpeaker 2: For women owned by POC entrepreneurs.\nSpeaker 3: So as a long time resident of Reno, I know.\nSpeaker 2: It's also important to continue building homes for our neighbors at different income levels.\nSpeaker 3: This project sets aside a certain number of homes for Denver residents earning no more than 60% AM-I.\nSpeaker 2: And that's really important for us as our city deals with this with such a tremendous housing shortage that impacts everyone in Denver. I'm very excited.\nSpeaker 3: To see the Five Points Larimer.\nSpeaker 2: Laura's project in the Rainbow neighborhood move forward and want to just mention that Tom Cuyler has been such an honorable and admirable mentor to our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 3: So thank you.\nSpeaker 2: And I encourage all of you to support this proposal.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Brad Plaisance.\nSpeaker 1: Hi. My name is Fred Pleasants. I have lived on the 2900 block of South Street ten of the 15 years I've been here in Denver. I won't waste a lot of time reiterating what everyone else already said, but for our reason for support, mostly in this order is the Affordable and Workforce Housing the Small Business Incubator.\nSpeaker 1: Being a small business owner myself, the community covered seemed so divisive over the last few years and people walking to meet and go to these gathering places is wonderful and that's what makes a community. Other than that, I'm just here for support and you guys have a good night and thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Brian Bass. And it looks like we don't have Brian with us. Brian Tobin. And we're not seeing Ryan either. Rob Gray. John. On, on, on.\nSpeaker 7: Good morning, city council. I'm going to just keep this really brief.\nSpeaker 1: I live on a 2900 block of Lawrence Street.\nSpeaker 7: And I'm a local business owner. I was introduced.\nSpeaker 1: To Tom a few months ago in my career, and I work with a lot of developers. And I'll just say that Tom and Edens.\nSpeaker 7: Is probably one of the most impressive developers that I've worked with. You know, their.\nSpeaker 1: Passion for creating.\nSpeaker 7: A community that benefits everybody, not just the top 10%, is really, really impressed me.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm I'm wholeheartedly in favor of this.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. It looks like we had Rob Gray. Robert Gray.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Robert Gray. I'm in support of what he is trying to do. I'm currently a tenant of the Friends.\nSpeaker 8: Of Art Gallery and one of their properties.\nSpeaker 1: Has been a dream come true. For me. To be a small business owner and have a opportunity to have a gallery as a room has opened up a lot of opportunities for me personally and also for our business.\nSpeaker 8: I'm a great.\nSpeaker 1: Supporter. I love what they're doing with the community. I've seen enough of other Bipoc businesses and really give people an opportunity to make their made their dreams come true with other local businesses. As the museum for black girl that was there.\nSpeaker 1: Our next door neighbor. So it's been great to work with not only time eaters but other big box retailers to really help us out and really get to know our community and provide opportunities like within Burberry and are going to burn and things like that.\nSpeaker 1: So I greatly appreciate the support of Tom and Ian's and everything that they're doing and I look forward to these opportunities continue.\nSpeaker 8: To spread into the community.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Rheumatol Thank you. Our next speaker is Nancy James. Do we have Nancy James with us. Okay. It looks like we don't. And so that concludes our speakers this evening. Appreciate all of the community members who signed up and spoke.\nSpeaker 0: Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22. Dash 476. Councilmember Torres.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: CBD. Just a question for you.\nSpeaker 2: A lot of what we've heard and I was reviewing the.\nSpeaker 0: Neighborhood plan was about the the difference between what the neighborhood plan allows and what the permissiveness of Blueprint was. Blueprint is pretty extensive in terms of the Five Points neighborhood and what what additional permission our future places allows.\nSpeaker 2: How much of.\nSpeaker 0: The neighborhood plan does it really kind of deem? Lower intensity than what blueprint will permit. This isn't going to be the only project along an entire stretch. Right, of Larimer Lawrence. That is going to be allowed to to rezone to.\nSpeaker 0: Be more intense than it currently is, or then that even the neighborhood plan allowed.\nSpeaker 8: Sure. So this map that I just pulled up shows the the the height recommendations from that plan. And you can see there that there are, you know, several kind of a corridor along Larimer, Lawrence and Arapahoe that have recommendations for three stories in the Northeast Downtowns Area Plan or neighborhoods plan.\nSpeaker 8: Well, you know, this would just rezone this one area is it is possible that another another applicant could propose a similar rezoning. I would note that the the adoption recently of the expanding housing affordability program does all now kind of automatically grant some increased height to other areas of the corridor that already have three and in some\nSpeaker 8: cases, five story zoning. But yes, so that, you know, this gives you a sense of kind of the area where that plan does have a lower height recommendation.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: But my my my question, I guess, is that. We're going to see more than likely a lot of utilization of that blueprint permission throughout that corridor without much, I think, pushback from the neighborhood plan. Right. Because Blueprint allows it.\nSpeaker 8: Well, I would say the blueprint, as a couple of the speakers mentioned, the blueprint does highlight the importance of neighborhood plans, but acknowledges that they do evolve over time and and sets forth some some considerations for when we have a conflict like this.\nSpeaker 8: And between the blueprint recommendation, that is a more sort of general higher level recommendation that, you know, for uses up to eight storeys in an area like this and you know, other other rezonings would be considered using those same exact the same exact factors as set forth in blueprint.\nSpeaker 8: And certainly there are other recommendations in the Northeast Downtowns Neighborhood Plan, Neighborhoods Plan that are furthered by this proposal. You know, the vibrant, walkable streets, a mix of uses in height is one element of the plan. But there are many other elements of the plan that would be furthered by this proposed rezoning.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam Chair.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, counsel. Pro tem to us, Councilman Cashman.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. Thank you, Madam President. Andrew. Is this project coming in under the guidelines of the VHA?\nSpeaker 1: So this the affordable.\nSpeaker 8: Housing agreement that has been reached between host and the applicants here is in line with the enhanced requirements of VHA, which, if applied to standard zone districts somewhere, would allow those additional height incentives. However, this was this was developed in advance of that the adoption of that of those code amendments.\nSpeaker 8: And and so the I would say that the agreement on affordable housing is certainly modeled after what was being proposed at the time.\nSpeaker 6: So they're but they're not paying the new linkage fees. They're paying our obscenely low previous linkage fee.\nSpeaker 1: That is a good question.\nSpeaker 8: I'm not sure I can respond specifically to the linkage fee.\nSpeaker 1: There if you have some comments on it.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman Cashman. So just to put some context, the project actually technically would be exempt from the FHA because of the timing requirements.\nSpeaker 6: But because of the.\nSpeaker 2: The timing requirements of the exemptions, the June 30th and the August 30th deadline.\nSpeaker 1: The.\nSpeaker 2: Right behavior. However, the applicant felt really strongly that they wanted to provide the enhanced affordability required under the FHA for a high cost market, even though this is a typical house market. So pretending we weren't going to be exempt from the FHA.\nSpeaker 2: So to that.\nSpeaker 3: End, as you know, with the FHA.\nSpeaker 2: And the enhanced affordability round for retail is actually exempt from paying any linkage fee at all. So in this instance, we are paying the mortgage fee under the old rules for all of the nonresidential uses and we're voluntarily providing that 10% at 60%.\nSpeaker 2: Am I. Does that answer your question?\nSpeaker 6: Well, so you're paying the old linkage fee on the areas that you do pay linkage fee on?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, but we're in the VHA.\nSpeaker 2: We would actually be exempt from paying the ground.\nSpeaker 6: Just.\nSpeaker 1: On the ground floor element of it.\nSpeaker 6: But that. What percentage of the square feet is your ground floor retail? Any clue?\nSpeaker 2: About 20%. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Any idea how many residential units you plan on building?\nSpeaker 1: Around 380 residential units currently across those two parcels. And how many square feet of commercial? Around 100,000 square feet of commercial uses. Retail uses of the ground.\nSpeaker 6: Effectively the complete ground floor.\nSpeaker 1: Because all the parking is below ground.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: You're welcome. Would you introduce yourself for the public record, please?\nSpeaker 1: Apologies. John McIntyre with probiotics.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. Council member state of Alaska.\nSpeaker 2: Q Just a question. When we deny our rezoning and it is consistent with the plan, we're often.\nSpeaker 3: Concerned that a developer will sue the city. In this case where you.\nSpeaker 2: Have community saying over and over that.\nSpeaker 3: It's not consistent with the neighborhood plan.\nSpeaker 2: And it's not. Do we have any liability?\nSpeaker 8: I think I would ask a representative from the city attorney's office to respond to that if possible.\nSpeaker 1: Wing members of council. Consultancy to back is your question. Are you questioning how we reconcile?\nSpeaker 3: Something like the city because we deny their plan. We're often very worried. But has there ever been a case where a community sues.\nSpeaker 2: The city when we.\nSpeaker 3: Approve something that was not.\nSpeaker 2: Consistent with the neighborhood plan?\nSpeaker 1: No, ma'am. So council has to stick to the criteria. And what I would suggest is that you take all the plans that the city has together, the comprehensive plan blueprint, Denver and the neighborhood plan, and see if you can reconcile those to support what is being requested this evening or this morning.\nSpeaker 3: And so if blue print is.\nSpeaker 2: The default in this situation, because it's the most general.\nSpeaker 3: And the most new. Why are we doing any neighborhood plans? If this is always the default.\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think the guidance and blueprint Denver is for for there to be small area plans for every neighborhood because. I think and I'll I'll defer to Andrew on this. But we want to. Boil down each neighborhood to what?\nSpeaker 1: What their specific parts are. So although we we see.\nSpeaker 7: Things on a global picture.\nSpeaker 1: It'd be nice for each neighborhood to have a very specific plan as to as to as to what that particular neighborhood wants.\nSpeaker 3: The most specific neighborhood level plan in this scenario.\nSpeaker 1: I'll defer to Andrew on that.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. I'm sorry. You're asking, what is the most specific neighborhood plan in this particular rezoning?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 8: The applicable neighborhood plan is the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods plan.\nSpeaker 2: And was there ever a proposal for that.\nSpeaker 3: Plan to be amended?\nSpeaker 1: I am not aware.\nSpeaker 8: Of of proposals for that plan to be amended.\nSpeaker 3: Got it. Thank you very much. That's it from my questions.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember CdeBaca. Councilmember Ortega.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. I do have a couple of questions and I'll start with you, Andrew. So actually the first one is not for you, but let me go to the ones that I do have for you. Okay?\nSpeaker 2: Let's see. Actually, these are these are for the applicants. So if I can have the applicant come up. Can you tell me if any existing businesses are being displaced as a result of the project? The I no one testified earlier that they were a willing seller, but are there any others that might be displeased that maybe at\nSpeaker 2: some point you might. I remember somebody mentioning there is the possibility that Texaco financing might be used for the project. Is there any anticipation that any of those funds might be used to pay for any relocation of any businesses?\nSpeaker 1: They're the only businesses that are existing and operating on their property. Now it's the Volunteers of America which will stay in place. And then Joe's Liquors, the liquor store. But the plan there is to incorporate it into an eventual grocery store so that use will stay on the property.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Into the Bowie kitchen, does that stay on site or does it get relocated to a different location?\nSpeaker 1: The commissary, kitchen and warehouse will be relocated to a different location.\nSpeaker 2: And where? Where will that be?\nSpeaker 1: There is an address. 4915 52nd Avenue in Commerce City.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And that is a much bigger site. Will still serve the same Denver community. I know they probably provide services outside of Denver as well. Andy, see you shaking your head. Yes. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we researched it with the Volunteers of America as far as their roots and where they're where the people that they're serving live as well as their employees. And it's actually a better location.\nSpeaker 2: And let me ask you about the businesses you've identified. A number of small and minority businesses. Has most of the space already been accounted for with those you've identified, or is there still more yet to be filled with some of the local businesses?\nSpeaker 1: There's still more yet to be filled in. So there's an existing two spaces. The commissary kitchen space will provide space for about four local businesses.\nSpeaker 2: So that'll be shared among different businesses using that commissary kitchen. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. And then the other species will provide that space for about six different businesses. And so there will be a combination of live work units and then existing space as well.\nSpeaker 2: So how are you identifying those? I'm just curious.\nSpeaker 1: We're working in partnership with Javon Taylor from Green Spaces and putting together a framework that where we'll be able to identify and work through a process to select applicants for businesses to be a part of.\nSpeaker 2: I know everybody knows this as five points. This is. Was formerly known as downtown in Curtis Park and historically was a very large Latino population. And I heard a number of speakers come up and talk about their. Involvement in conversations and possibility of of having some businesses on the site, which sound really exciting.\nSpeaker 2: I think that's that's going to be good for the neighborhood. But I was just curious if you have Latino businesses that are part of that as well.\nSpeaker 1: We would love for Latino businesses to be a part of it as well.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. There are some folks that do work in the community that you may or may not be plugged into. Jessica Holguin is one of the folks who may be part of your.\nSpeaker 1: Jessica is helping us with the Commissary Kitchen program, so she's partnering with us. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: So she's very connected to a lot of our Latino businesses, which I know we still have a lot of that live in the community, a lot of Latino families. And so I just wanted to raise that as what may bring about greater, you know, long term support for the project and integration with the people in the community\nSpeaker 2: . So we want to raise that.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Let you see, there is just a couple more brief ones. So you already talked about the total number of units. Can you speak a little bit about the unit mix? Are you looking to do any family size units in the development?\nSpeaker 1: We haven't determine the final unit this year within the building, but right now we're looking at a mix of studios, one bedrooms and two bedroom.\nSpeaker 2: And do you anticipate having to access low income tax credits to do the housing, the affordable housing onsite?\nSpeaker 1: We do not expect to have to access low income.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And for families that qualify for the 60%, you would take vouchers. Would you take.\nSpeaker 1: That? We should go investigate that. We have not determined that yet.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. I think that that would be another opportunity to serve some of the folks that are looking for affordable housing. I think those are the only questions I have for now. So thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Black.\nSpeaker 4: I'm sorry to keep the conversation going at 110. Andrew, a quick question for you and I know the answer because I'm looking at it, but what year was the northeast downtown area plan done?\nSpeaker 8: It was adopted in 2011.\nSpeaker 4: That's right. So 2011 was a really long time ago. And that area has changed quite a bit. And one of the criteria for the rezoning is that that there has been a change in circumstance. And so when we are looking at various plans, that is one thing we also consider.\nSpeaker 4: And the area has changed quite a lot since 2011. And I know we talk about area plans a lot and I haven't said this gosh, for years for sure. I haven't said it since COVID. I don't have one area plan in my whole district.\nSpeaker 3: Zero.\nSpeaker 4: Not a one. And there's also a great deal of change happening in my district, not like right now, but still a lot of change. And community members desperately want to have yellow area plans in a couple of different areas.\nSpeaker 4: So I know that there are needs for updated ones, but when we think about our entire city, we also need to think remember that some kids don't have any. But anyway, I just wanted to make that point about the age of that and that one area is change.\nSpeaker 4: That is another thing that we consider when we're reviewing the criteria. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Black, we've got councilmembers to back up next, but we're going to go ahead and go to Councilmember Flynn and come back to Councilmember, say, Bacchus, since she'd ask questions. So go ahead, Councilman.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Wow.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Madam President. Andrew, I just want to make sure that I clearly understand the height issue, the number of floors under the GMU, 30 under old chapter 59. There is no height limit, but there is floor area ratio limitation that effectively it's a it's a 1 to 1, I think.\nSpeaker 6: Correct, that's.\nSpeaker 8: Correct. It has a floor at the CMU 30 zone district has a floor area ratio of one.\nSpeaker 6: Yep. Right. So if you had a large enough lot, you could build a really tall pencil. But you. But that's not really practical. Correct. So to develop on this parcel, I'm sorry to develop in this area that has the old chapter 59.\nSpeaker 6: You know, in conformance with the 2011 neighborhood plan, it would have to be resigned as well. But to a three storey. Off the shelf zone. Could it not? And to keep with the three story guidance on Larimer Street.\nSpeaker 8: To Jim to establish a limit of three stories. Yes, exactly. But I think development could occur under the 30 district. That is three stories tall.\nSpeaker 6: Sure. But it'd be it'd be 1 to 1. That's correct. So I guess my question is now, with the added provisions in the recent in the just adopted expanding housing affordability, how how would the properties that already are zoned for that with the three storey limitation, how how many stories could they add conceivably if they met the\nSpeaker 6: incentives in VHA?\nSpeaker 8: So properties that currently have three story zoned districts from the Denver zoning code. Yes. Could, if they met the enhanced affordability requirements could have one additional story. So for that, I pulled up the existing zoning map here. There is some five story zoning and and other districts in this area as well where, you know, up to two\nSpeaker 8: additional stories could be up to seven.\nSpeaker 6: Up to seven. But they're not on Larimer Street right now. Correct.\nSpeaker 8: Let's see. I'm looking at there is one developer. There is one area of of existing CM five zoning at 25th and Larimer at the at the northwest or the southwest corner.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I actually have the zoning map up here, too. I see. All right. Thank you. That's all I have.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. And Councilmember CdeBaca, it sounded like you were okay. You didn't have any additional questions, and so just wanted to confirm that.\nSpeaker 2: So that's good.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. All right. Thank you. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 476. Council members CdeBaca.\nSpeaker 2: You know.\nSpeaker 3: I really just want to.\nSpeaker 2: Stressed to my colleagues that we cannot move.\nSpeaker 3: The target over and over for communities.\nSpeaker 2: On some nights, we pass plans.\nSpeaker 3: Only because they meet every criteria tonight. We don't have a single.\nSpeaker 2: Plan.\nSpeaker 3: Where it.\nSpeaker 2: Shows us on a map that this is consistent.\nSpeaker 3: With what neighborhoods or even citywide.\nSpeaker 2: Participants in a process have.\nSpeaker 3: Deemed appropriate.\nSpeaker 2: This is one.\nSpeaker 3: Scenario that sends a flag to community that you.\nSpeaker 2: Can create an entire process and zone.\nSpeaker 3: And pod when we're trying to move away from parties. If you have enough money to.\nSpeaker 2: Own two blocks. That is unfair to everyone else that we put through these processes. There are people who can't even get a fence variance if they don't have someone else on their same block with the height of fence that they're looking to have.\nSpeaker 2: For us to do this even in a situation.\nSpeaker 3: Where we do want to drive development. Without amending the plan is confusing. And so I think that if we are going to say that. If you put all.\nSpeaker 2: Of this together, you can extrapolate.\nSpeaker 3: That this might be okay. Then we should make an.\nSpeaker 2: Amendment to the plan, and we should give.\nSpeaker 3: Community members an opportunity to participate in amending.\nSpeaker 2: The plan.\nSpeaker 3: For the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 2: I don't think that this is a bad project. I don't think that going higher on Larmour.\nSpeaker 3: Is a bad idea. But I do.\nSpeaker 2: Think that communities should have a solid static target.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that there should be community participation when we diverge.\nSpeaker 2: From multiple plans.\nSpeaker 3: In this way.\nSpeaker 2: And so for tonight, I don't think that this is consistent with any single plan. And so I cannot support that because we cannot send that message to community that we can just pull.\nSpeaker 3: Things out of thin air.\nSpeaker 2: And see if it sticks. It's not.\nSpeaker 3: Fair. That's it for my comments.\nSpeaker 0: I'm not seeing any other folks in the queue for comments, and so I'll go ahead and add my own that. I do highly respect Andrew Webb and his work and the CPD planners who have looked at this and I understand the residents who are in opposition because of the density and because of change in the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 0: But this is an impressive project and I don't think on my time in council that during a required public hearing we have had so many members of the public in favor of a project, I mean, person after person after person.\nSpeaker 0: And so I have to really commend this team for the public outreach and engagement and especially your commitment to specifically bipoc businesses, individuals in the neighborhood. And I really look forward to seeing how this works and how this can possibly be replicated, because I think it's a model that we should really look at.\nSpeaker 0: And so I will be in support of it this evening. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22, Dash 476, please.\nSpeaker 2: CDEBACA No. Hines.\nSpeaker 7: I.\nSpeaker 2: Can each I black i. Clark.\nSpeaker 6: All right.\nSpeaker 2: Flynn.\nSpeaker 6: I.\nSpeaker 1: Herndon, I.\nSpeaker 2: Cashman Ortega.\nSpeaker 5: I swear.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 5: Torres, I. Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce the result one day.\nSpeaker 5: 11 Eyes.\nSpeaker 0: 11 Eyes Council Bill 20 2-476 have passed. I'd like to thank the members of the public and CPD staff for staying with with us this evening.

Final Report.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, OC Councilmember.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Madam Mayor. In an abundance of caution, I'm going to recuse myself on this entire item, perhaps after the city attorney can, you know, remind people of recusal and who makes that decision and so on. But I'm not going to be here for that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Oti and Councilmember Vela.\nSpeaker 11: Yes. And in an abundance of caution, I'm also going to be recusing myself from the entire item.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Vela. Okay. With that, it is 829. We're coming back in 10 minutes and I do mean 10 minutes. I'll see you all at eight. Well, 840. 11 minutes. Is that okay? Okay.\nSpeaker 2: All right. And then gentlemen here, just.\nSpeaker 1: 77.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Yes, I am.\nSpeaker 1: All right.\nSpeaker 0: If I could ask everyone to take their seats. The city council meeting is back in session on the people. The city council meeting is back in session. Please sit down and stop talking so much as I love you.\nSpeaker 0: All set.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, everyone. We really. We have lots to cover. And we do our best work when it's not the middle of the night, at least as far as I'm concerned. So, Madam Clerk, could I have you please introduce this next item, and then I'm going to ask the city attorney for a brief explanation.\nSpeaker 1: This is provide direction on letter to the presiding judge of the Alameda County Superior Court in response to the 2018 19 Alameda County grand jury final report.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And Mr. Chan, if I could ask you, just before we took our break, two of our colleagues recused themselves. Could you give the audience a brief explanation of what that means?\nSpeaker 12: I'm happy to do so under state and common law. Recusals happen here. I'll get closer to the microphone. This is.\nSpeaker 0: Better. That's better.\nSpeaker 12: Understand, in common law, elected officials may choose to recuse him or herself when they believe that there is a conflict of interest. That decision belongs to each individual elected official. Our office provides advice on that topic. So does the PC.\nSpeaker 12: Ultimately, each elected official will have to make their own decision on whether or not there is a conflict that's presented that would counsel for recusal. And when an elected official makes that decision, they announce that from the dais and they leave the room.\nSpeaker 12: And that is what you saw tonight.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Shinn. So at this point, I was actually going to dispense with the staff report because it's very brief and I think probably quite understandable. And I imagine we have quite a few public.\nSpeaker 1: Speakers, 18.\nSpeaker 0: 18 So when we have more than six public speakers, you each get 2 minutes. And as you have previously observed, we, we are strict about observing that because otherwise things just will be here way too long. So it really helps if when you hear your name in the city clerk, we'll call a series of names, if you\nSpeaker 0: will, just scoot out to the aisle so you can get up to the the podium and you will have our undivided attention. And I would just request the audience and you've been a great audience, and I just continue to be respectful as you are.\nSpeaker 0: Everyone has a right to speak, regardless of their opinion, regardless of whether you agree with it or disagree with it. We we don't applaud Heckle Boo do the way. We just listen respectfully so that no one is intimidated into not wanting to speak.\nSpeaker 0: So with that, let's get started with public comment. Of course. Councilmember Vice Mayor, I.\nSpeaker 6: Have one question. Of course. We've received a number of social media has been rife with comments. We've received a number of letters from people asking us tonight to take action to remove our colleagues. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how it is an elected official sitting on a city council in Alameda can\nSpeaker 6: be elected or removed from office.\nSpeaker 12: Be happy to you generally. And in this case, there are essentially three methods that an elected official, for example, a council member, may be removed from office. One of them is through the district attorney's grand jury process, which is what we're here to discuss today, though, it's important to know that the grand jury did not return an\nSpeaker 12: accusation. And so that process is not before the council and it's not before the public. The second possibility and these are all just theoretical possibilities of if there is a elected official convicted of a felony under the state law and an elected official once convicted of such a crime will be automatically removed.\nSpeaker 12: And thirdly, it's through the electoral process, either through a recall petition or at the ballot box at the regular election cycle. The Alameda City Charter does not provide for, nor does the general law provide for the opportunity for a city council to remove one of its members.\nSpeaker 12: And that particular action is not available to the council and certainly not before the council tonight.\nSpeaker 6: Can I ask just a clarifying you use the term accusation that the general that the grand jury did not return an accusation. Can you just talk about the.\nSpeaker 12: Of that? Absolutely. So that is a legal term under state law. If a grand jury believes that a a crime that was committed and committed and it was serious enough and there were sufficient votes. The grand jury could forward what's essentially a legal document, which is called an accusation to the district attorney, requesting that the district attorney\nSpeaker 12: charged a public official with removal. And that did not occur in this case.\nSpeaker 0: And I'll follow up with to that. But the grand jury did comment on that, I believe, on the electoral process in talking about its decision not to make the accusation.\nSpeaker 12: Certainly the grand I mean, the report provides that the electoral the grand jury essentially deferred to the electoral process to make that decision, which is either at the ballot box or through a recall process.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 6: So it's just just the one last thing. So in this case, no crime where violating violating the charter is not a crime. So there's no felony charge or anything that the district attorney could prosecute. So the only way the district attorney would get involved in removing would be to prosecute a grand jury accusation.\nSpeaker 6: And so the process would be that the grand jury would be asked to look at that. They would make a finding. And then if they determined during that. Is that.\nSpeaker 0: A question?\nSpeaker 6: I just want to. Yeah. That they would return an accusation that it would be prosecuted. And at that point in time, the removal would happen. Right. That so I want to just make sure I understand the process.\nSpeaker 12: So I don't want to comment on whether or not a crime is or isn't present because that that's it's difficult for me to comment on what the district attorney may or may not determine whether or not a crime is present.\nSpeaker 12: That's certainly not before the council tonight and not before this and not what this action is. The the report itself speaks for itself.\nSpeaker 6: Right. And is the end of that process the end the end of the civil grand jury process.\nSpeaker 12: Essentially, with this council having to take an action tonight to provide responses?\nSpeaker 6: Yes. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And that is an important distinction. This was a report by the civil grand jury.\nSpeaker 12: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. Any further clarification questions? Okay. So with that, we're going to get started on public comment.\nSpeaker 1: Russ Chia, Teeny, Laura Thomas and Tony Graham.\nSpeaker 2: Mayor Ashcraft, members of the city council. Tonight should be a night of celebration.\nSpeaker 0: It is. Mike.\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm sorry. Tonight should be a night of celebration. I say that because finally, an independent body, a cross-section of the community in Alameda County, had a chance to review the misconduct charges against Councilperson Vela A.D. in their investigation, unlike the city investigation.\nSpeaker 2: They got to hear all the evidence. They got to hear the tape recording, which is the best evidence in this case. Not surprisingly, the grand jury examined all the evidence, and they found that Councilman Vela and O.D. improperly tried to influence the selection of the new fire chief in Alameda.\nSpeaker 2: Maybe more shockingly, they concluded that the accused council persons were allowed to participate in the editing of the City Run Investigation Report. I got to tell you, I was a prosecutor for 40 years. We never invited the accused in to alter the police reports.\nSpeaker 2: It's that's the most primitive notion of conflict of interest, how they could participate in something that is examining their own conduct. But nevertheless, they did. So sadly, tonight, we're not celebrating. The handling of this matter by Syd. The city has been shameful at best.\nSpeaker 2: It erodes any confidence the taxpayer should have and elected to city officials. We've already paid out $1,000,000 for the mist, mis deeds of these two council persons. And now you're going to be making decisions on whether or not we pay $200,000 for their attorney fees.\nSpeaker 2: All the while, the public's been kept in the dark. Public media has made requests for a copy of the tape, and the city has stonewalled too many major media outlets. So I would implore you to release the tape and not to vote to pay the attorneys.\nSpeaker 0: Give estrogen tenure. Your next speaker is Thomas Graham. No, it's not Q&A. No. Later, you can ask of the city attorney if you had a question. But no, it was not Q&A. Good evening.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Madam Mayor. And council members present. I'm Laura Thomas with the Renewed Hope Housing Advocates. And tonight I'm speaking on behalf of Alameda, renters, seniors, labor and all who support our strong progressive council. I want to thank the grand jury for its work and the city for taking steps to resolve an issue that's become a distraction\nSpeaker 3: . While many of us don't agree with all aspects of the findings or how the fire chief selection process was characterized, we should all be able to agree on the following. First, the Chief Rodriguez has been doing a great job leading the department and building trust with his firefighters and the public.\nSpeaker 3: We thank the chief and the firefighters for responding so quickly to the Woodstock fire this weekend. Second, we can agree that with the new city leadership, new city manager, mayor and council members who have championed our 9911 our emergency medical or affordable housing and homeless services, that our city is positioned to address the challenges that remain.\nSpeaker 3: Our island is characterized now by a strong quality of life diversity and a welcoming spirit. Yet our immigrants are under attack like never before, and future generations of Alabamians may never be able to afford to live here. Traffic congestion threatens our quality of life, and we need real transit solutions.\nSpeaker 3: And finally, sea level rise will affect our unique island environment. We ask that you answer our call to move forward as a team to address these issues. We need the strong leadership that each one of you provides. And we have a coalition here tonight that is calling for this.\nSpeaker 3: All these everybody here. It is in that spirit, that vocal unable.\nSpeaker 0: Ask you to sit down so you don't block the view of people behind you. But thank you. Your attendance is noted.\nSpeaker 3: It's in that spirit that the vocal, unabashed commitment to our safety and quality of life from two council members. That brings us here today. As you know, public service and gratifying.\nSpeaker 0: And next speaker.\nSpeaker 1: Is Tony Grimm and Sunny Duncan and Elizabeth Green.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Queue up, if you would. Hello.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. I want to express my appreciation to council members Jim Audy, Amelia Vella for their service to the Alamogordo community. During all of the council meetings I have attended or listened to over the course of several years.\nSpeaker 3: They have always been well-prepared to discuss the issues at hand. They consider input from their constituency. They have thoughtful questions and they give the reasons for their decisions. I believe that they have always acted in good faith. I do not intend to imply that other council members did not do this also.\nSpeaker 3: But I want to single out members Odion Vella tonight because I believe they are under attack by political opponents. I want them to know that there are a lot of people in Alameda who support them. We are the people who elected them.\nSpeaker 3: I hope that the Council will make changes to the city charter and enact new procedures that will make it very clear to council members now and in the future what they can and cannot do to represent their constituents.\nSpeaker 3: Please decide when a letter of recommendation is in various interference and when it is, a council member is right to advocate for a constituent so that the door is not left open for politicizing council members actions and city procedures at great expense to the city.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Duncan and Elizabeth Green, then Bernie Mathews. Okay. Mr.. Hello. You all know me. I'm Barney Duncan, and I came here for Jim and Leah. As far as I'm concerned, I'm a tenant. I know nothing about the law.\nSpeaker 1: But I did read in the paper what the court said. The way I took it, the court has said everybody.\nSpeaker 0: Needs to go to.\nSpeaker 1: Classes. They have to learn how to run.\nSpeaker 3: The council.\nSpeaker 1: And the staff members have to learn how to run the staff. That's what I got out of the whole thing. Okay. Maria Melia and Jim have helped the tenants out more than anyone else.\nSpeaker 3: They fought for.\nSpeaker 2: Us.\nSpeaker 3: They backed us up. And as far as I'm concerned, if you get rid of them, you're.\nSpeaker 1: Getting rid of the two people that are really good on this council.\nSpeaker 2: We finally got a.\nSpeaker 3: Council that cares about the tenants. You also now own and care about the tenants.\nSpeaker 1: And you, John Whyte, care about the tenants. I, you know, I don't know the new city attorney or the city manager and the city clerk all I don't know. But I do know these people. I have spoke with them.\nSpeaker 1: I have got.\nSpeaker 3: My point across to them. I'm only a tenant. I don't have all this big.\nSpeaker 0: Language.\nSpeaker 1: That you expect to come out of my mouth. It doesn't come out of my mouth.\nSpeaker 2: I'm just a street.\nSpeaker 1: Person that wants to keep people in.\nSpeaker 3: That back doors up. That's it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Green.\nSpeaker 3: Hello again. I've reviewed the grand jury's report and the city's draft response to the grand jury. I strongly encourage the city to revise its response letter to completely accept the grand jury's findings and recommendations without qualifications. I find many of the city's draft responses to be filled with wiggle words such as staff and council worked together to\nSpeaker 3: consider options for additional training or consider strengthening the charter. That's not good enough. All the option to responses have to go. The Grand Juries report makes it clear that both council members one and two, behaved unethically in their coercion of this former city manager.\nSpeaker 3: The city must take concrete actions now, including revising the city charter to prevent conflicts of interest and council interference with the city manager. The city must implement a code of conduct and mandate regular ethics training for council members and senior staff.\nSpeaker 3: Now, let's take a step back and look back. Look at this event in a maybe simpler, less legalistic way. I think what we really have here is a case of two council members who attempted to bully the former city manager, have not admitted their errors and now seek to be rewarded for their bad behavior by requesting reimbursement\nSpeaker 3: for their legal expenses. Perhaps they may even pursue legal action against the city in order to be reimbursed. How can this possibly be okay? How can we explain to our children that our city government is so corrupt that it allows bullies to call the shots?\nSpeaker 3: Madam Mayor and Council members, I urge you to seriously implement every measure recommended by the Grand Jury in order to attempt to restore a measure of public trust in city government.\nSpeaker 0: And our next speaker is.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Mathews Bowling and Pam Low.\nSpeaker 0: Yet. Come on up.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor. Members of the city council. My name is Bernie Mathews. I was in the law and municipal law enforcement for 40 years. I had the honor and privilege last 12 of those 40 to be your police chief.\nSpeaker 2: I've stated in the past I am extremely concerned about the demonstrated lack of leadership, ethical behavior, failures to following the rules and regulations, the law, and owning up to mistakes by the City Council. Specifically, two of its members whose lack of ethical behavior, which has been documented in the recent Alameda County Grand Jury Report regarding the debacle\nSpeaker 2: of the hiring process of the fire chief. As I speak to you tonight, absolutely no action has been initiated by by this council to reprimand and or censure Mr. O.D. or Ms.. Vale of unethical conduct on their part regarding this issue.\nSpeaker 2: The proposition that the offending members did not know that this was a violation of the law but also was a violation of common sense and honor, is truly unbelievable to believe that Mrs. Vella, an attorney as well as an adjunct professor at Mills College, teaching ethics and Mr. O.D., a state director for California Assembly member, did not\nSpeaker 2: know that this was a violation is simply laughable. Also, sadly, when all totals are going to cost the taxpayers over $1,000,000, of course, mingled in all this intrigue is a five ton elephant in the room, the Alameda Firefighters Union, which has a strong hold and influence on this council in this case, certainly Mr. O.D. and as well\nSpeaker 2: . In closing, I strongly urging the city council to impose consequences and discipline and or censure both Della Vella and O.D. based on proven grand jury documentations of violations of law and intent to and also release the tape recordings obtained by the former city manager in the public.\nSpeaker 2: Let us not do a Trump esq move and ignore the facts and allow the behavior to have no consequences. Instead, you must and do the right and moral thing.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. MATTHEWS. Our next speaker is.\nSpeaker 1: Zac BOLLING, then Panelo, then Steve Slackman.\nSpeaker 4: Hey, counsel. So the grand jury made some mistakes in its investigation. They never interview the council members that were actually directly involved in any of this. And they made false claims like militia voting for the package that she didn't.\nSpeaker 4: The grand jury process doesn't give the council members really any point to clarify any of their actions. It's not that process. All they do is they provide oversight. They make recommendations. They can start formal accusations, but they're not that kind of body to claim and give them an opportunity to make their case.\nSpeaker 4: People like to use it as a statement of fact of what actually occurred. And I don't believe that they acted unethically myself. I think that my actions and are watching them. They are honorable people. And so given all that specifically on this this thing, I would ask you on finding 19 four, you respond with option two in\nSpeaker 4: the draft letter that two claimed that both of them committed charter violations is incorrect. It also set a very terrible precedent that if you you guys you guys don't make a lot. You make gas money to get here.\nSpeaker 4: And it sets a terrible precedent that the only people that could ever sit up on council are people that are well-off enough to personally take the burden.\nSpeaker 5: On of any.\nSpeaker 4: Kind of action that they could take. Like me and my job, I wouldn't I'm not personally liable if I make a mistake at work like I might get fired, but I don't have to burden that expense. And to say that our council members have to they're not indemnify.\nSpeaker 4: They don't get paid back. That's I know it's not the issue today, but they deserve it. They deserve to have their legal expenses paid because it's a terrible precedent to set. To say that the only people that can sit up on this council are the people that are well-off enough, that are in the top echelons that have\nSpeaker 4: 100 grand.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. BOLLING. Your next speaker is Pam Lowe. And I'll remind the audience, we don't applaud and we don't comment. We just listen to our speakers and we have one speaker at a time. We don't see.\nSpeaker 1: Ten.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. We do allow moral support.\nSpeaker 1: Hi.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Please.\nSpeaker 3: From the information provided in the grand jury report, it is clear to council members intentionally and inappropriately interfered in the fair chief hiring process. The city of Alameda is not partially responsible due to inadequately training new council members on finding 19 dash to a support opinion to partially disagree.\nSpeaker 3: I'm not a lawyer, but as a citizen I would expect most report subjects to be honest to tender their resignation as part of the city's response to the grand jury report. I understand there's no enforcement mechanism, but when it says in the city charter section seven, dash three, an attempt by a council member to influence the city\nSpeaker 3: manager in the making of an appointment or the purchase of any materials or supplies shall subject such council member to removal from office for malfeasance. It's pretty clear to me I don't know what malfeasance is, but removal from office is really clear.\nSpeaker 3: I'm finding 19 dash four I so I support option one agree and I urge the editor the comment to read to council members did attempt to influence the city manager. Therefore the other council members. Personally, I would call for their resignation.\nSpeaker 3: I understand it's up to them, or at least an extremely strong censorship. I also am concerned of the precedent being set by the actions in this entire affair. On recommendation 319, Dash three. I support, frankly, a new option three, which is that this recommendation has been adopted and implemented effective immediately, that no legal representation cost related to\nSpeaker 3: this matter shall be reimbursed. If I took a truck and ran into the library, can I submit for reimbursement from the city? Because nobody sent me a notice that that was specifically illegal, right? I received no training to that effect.\nSpeaker 3: You can't make.\nSpeaker 1: A listening to you.\nSpeaker 0: Very much. Our next speaker is. Our series of speakers are.\nSpeaker 1: Steve Larson, David GREENE and Jerry Johanson.\nSpeaker 0: There's Mr. Slauson and Mr. Green. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor Ashcroft and council members. The grand jury report is very clear. Council members Villa and Odie violated the city charter and interfered with the city manager's duties. These two have damaged the city and the people of Alameda to the tune of $1,000,000.\nSpeaker 2: These two have damaged the integrity of this city government, and now they have insulted the people of Alameda by asking us to pay for their attorney's fees to cover the cost of their unlawful conduct. They say there should be some more training for these two malarkey.\nSpeaker 2: These two knew what to do. Ignorance of the law in their case is no defense. It is specifically requested that the proper response to the grand jury report is a submission of the resignation of Council member Odie and Council member Vella, and also as item number two, a firm rejection for their request for their attorney's fees.\nSpeaker 2: It is suggested you three have a heart to heart. Chat with those two and tell them it is the only honorable thing for them to do and clear up this mess so we can all move forward. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Green. And just for clarification. The request for payment of legal fees is not before us tonight.\nSpeaker 10: It's not, but it.\nSpeaker 2: Will be.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Your time is starting.\nSpeaker 10: 17, 17. A 17 year old girl stood up here and was crying today. She was crying because she's looking for protection. She was talking to the leader. She was looking for help. And yet she's talking to two people up here who a grand jury found were fighting to hire somebody who's less than the best to give her\nSpeaker 10: protection. A less than qualified chief of the fire department than what was otherwise available. That's what they were fighting for. And that's what these are. It's just frustrating. So the bottom line is this. The council has already approved a million bucks to help to try to clean up the problem.\nSpeaker 10: There's an implication of people screwed up in that to go ahead and say you screwed up and you're also going to get reimbursed the 200 bucks, the $200,000. That's just talk about setting a bad precedent. You three need to have a deep talk with each of yourselves because their behavior is reflecting on you right now.\nSpeaker 10: What your reactions are to this and coming out and talking about whether or not you endorse the behavior that took place or not. That's going to be what I'm really going to be waiting for and listening to, not as a complete counsel.\nSpeaker 10: I'll be listening to that, but as the individuals on the council as well. Removal for malfeasance. Just create the process for doing that and get rid of them. You have the powers.\nSpeaker 0: To bring in. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 1: Is Johansen and have Todd then Trish Spencer.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. I first want to applaud Councilman Desai and Councilman White for already starting this process by holding public hearings on how to.\nSpeaker 1: Revise and update the charter.\nSpeaker 3: I was fortunate to attend one of those meetings and I think that's a great step in the right direction. Basically, what this is an issue along with some of the other issues that has divided our community.\nSpeaker 1: It it's preventing us from moving forward.\nSpeaker 3: Our two council members have worked Derrick.\nSpeaker 1: Have been dedicated to Alameda and to the people of Alameda.\nSpeaker 3: And this issue has just kind of been holding us back.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm hoping that we can get beyond it.\nSpeaker 3: That we can make recommendations, that we can move forward.\nSpeaker 1: And that we can have training and that we can revise.\nSpeaker 3: The charter so that it's more specific how to regulate this and that we continue with the team that we have.\nSpeaker 1: Because I think we're moving forward in Alameda and we need to concentrate on much more the climate action and a lot of trafficking and rent and families and.\nSpeaker 3: A lot of other issues. So I'm hoping that we all can move forward.\nSpeaker 1: In a positive way. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Todd. Mr. TEICH.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, everybody. This is very distressing. The poor are holding.\nSpeaker 0: Closer to the microphone, please.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Better?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Just briefly. Before coming here, I reread the Declaration of Independence, the full marvel that enumerated all the aggressions or. Or failings of the despot in England. I'm reading it, and all along it is. It's detailing what's happening today.\nSpeaker 2: Not only here in Alameda, but across the country. There's an organization called Equal Justice. They take on all cases to just resolution. I sat on a grand jury a couple of years ago in Lake County. Now, I can't go back there unless I'm armed and involved.\nSpeaker 2: Crystal meth. This disturbing grand jury report is scathing. There's no there's just no glossing over it. Something must be done. Somebody needs to become contrite instead of demanding a payment for attorney services that they created. Nobody's going to pay for my defender, my public defender.\nSpeaker 2: They stand up there and don't do a thing. I still get guilty. Equal justice. Whether it's for an officer, city councilman, a street person. A. Victim of mortgage and securities violations. These are all real. They take place every day in our society and nobody cares who holds the deed on this property.\nSpeaker 2: Which bank is it sitting? It would deed. What bank is holding the deed on?\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Todd. Ernie Martin here is thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Trish Spencer, Barbara Cohn and Rosalind Fortuna.\nSpeaker 0: All right, Ms.. Spencer.\nSpeaker 1: Evening. Thank you. The charter language is very clear. Article two, section two, dash to a council. Appoint city manager. Article seven, Section seven, dash two. City manager shall have the power and it shall be his or her duty.\nSpeaker 1: See to appoint employees of the city under his or her jurisdiction. That includes the fire chief. Section seven, Dash three. Neither council nor any member shall interfere with the execution by the city manager of their duties and an attempt by a City Council member to influence the City Manager in the making of any appointment shall subject such\nSpeaker 1: City and City Council member to removal from office for malfeasance. So I think that's actually very clear. I think the grand jury did get it wrong. I know in regards to the vote for the multimillion dollar settlement, it was 3 to 2 with member Vela and myself voting no.\nSpeaker 1: I think that has to be corrected. I think that's significant because Member Ody did vote as part of the three to support it. For clarification, I was not interviewed by the grand jury finding 19 dash one failure to provide council members with adequate training.\nSpeaker 1: There's sufficient training, and I don't think there's any problem with the training. And as was stated before, you have to the both councilmembers are attorneys. So I would say option two on that partially disagree. Friday night 19 Dash two Charter.\nSpeaker 3: Fails to provide enforcement mechanisms. Again, I think the charter is very clear.\nSpeaker 1: Subject to removal. So for that, I would say option to 19 Dash three participation and editing. I again would say option two. I we asked the city attorney at the time they were told they could participate. But at the end of the day, I think the report was independent.\nSpeaker 1: 19 Dash four Was there interference? I would partially disagree because the question is an attempt to influence. That's what our charter provides.\nSpeaker 0: And thank you for being here. Next speaker is Ms.. Cohen. I believe Ms.. Cohen.\nSpeaker 3: I don't really need a mike because.\nSpeaker 0: Actually you do. But I do. People I'm listening to television won't hear you unless you're in talking to Mike.\nSpeaker 3: I'm just going to be short and sweet. My name is Barbara Cohn. I'm a resident of Alameda, been living here for the last 40 years. I second most of what the people have said before me in terms of the behavior of these two council people, I would think presumed on how intelligent and well prepared they are.\nSpeaker 3: They would have known better than to violate the city charter. So my question to you is, when is this going to be resolved? Is it going to be behind closed door? And we're going to read about it in the Sun or the journal, and we'll find out that the city council has paid for their legal fees, which\nSpeaker 3: I find very questionable. And is there going to be a future meeting on this so that we know what's going on? Is this going to be done behind a closed door? And my other recommendation is, I think the three minute rule for all speakers is good.\nSpeaker 3: I think it should also be applied to the members of the city council.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. Okay. And just for clarification, because that was addressed. We actually do have a time limit. We have 9 minutes per item and we have our clocks in front of us as well. But since we're making the policy and not just commenting on an item, that was something that was determined.\nSpeaker 0: And I do find that our speakers are quite able to enunciate their views in two or 3 minutes. And our next speaker.\nSpeaker 1: Is Rosa, Linda Fortuna. Then Doug Briggs, then Doyle Saylor. All right.\nSpeaker 0: You heard the clerk. So be ready and we'll keep this moving.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, I'm Rosa, Linda Fortuna. I want to thank council members Vella and Odie for their decision to recuse themselves because of their conflict of interest. The public needs to be allowed to review the unredacted independent investigation report, which is originally 70 pages along with the city council.\nSpeaker 1: The City Council Members Redacted report, which the Council edited and reduced this outsiders report from 70 pages to 13 pages. The grand jury concluded that the council's editing of the report from 70 pages to only 13 pages, damaged the independence of the analysis.\nSpeaker 1: The grand jury also concluded that the council members should not have participated in the acceptance and editing of this report. They should not have been allowed to participate, period, because of their personal interest that conflicted with their official capacities.\nSpeaker 1: Mayor Ashcroft's recommendation, heard in her letter to Judge Carvill for city council workshops, does not resolve the problem that we have. Both council members, Belen OED are licensed California attorneys. They both had to pass the ethics tests for the state bar.\nSpeaker 1: Any lawyer can read City Charter Section seven, Dash three, and know that any attempt by a council member to influence the city manager in the making of any important man shall subject such council member to removal. Any lawyer should be competent to read and understand the law.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Bruce Belen already knew exactly what they were doing. I would like Alameda who are watching this council meeting on TV to remember when elections come next year in 2020 when voting for two open seat city council members between.\nSpeaker 0: And I believe Mr. Biggs is there next. Thank you for your comments, Mr. Biggs. And Mr. Biggs is followed by Mr. Saylor. Do I hear? Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. My name is Doug Biggs. I'm a resident of Alameda. I want to appreciate the comments that Vice Mayor John actually began at this meeting. Your job is not tonight.\nSpeaker 0: Is that just 1/2 and hold this time, please? I'm gonna ask that anyone who wants to make conversation in the audience do so in the hall so we can concentrate on the speaker. So can I get anyone who wants to make conversation to take that outside to the hall?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. This is the speaker's time. Please present Mr. Biggs, clerk.\nSpeaker 2: So I appreciate the comment that was made in the clarification that your job tonight isn't to seek removal and you have no grounds to seek removal of any council member. And also, you're not here to talk about legal fees, although I do want to comment about that in a minute.\nSpeaker 2: I think what the fact that most of the people up here calling for the heads of the council members have not really read the grand jury report. They're using it for their own purpose of stifling. First Amendment rights in the hope that these people will not speak out for the poorest, for the most needy in the future\nSpeaker 2: . And that is a dangerous path to take. When you read the grand jury report carefully and there are flaws and those need do need to be acknowledged and called out to them at the bottom of it. What they're saying really is that the charter has to be updated.\nSpeaker 2: There's ambiguity in the charter, and there's there's there's lack of of accountability in the charter. That's what needs to be dealt with. And we also need to work on the charter to make sure that council members that need to express their First Amendment rights are allowed to do that in an appropriate way.\nSpeaker 2: Just one thing regarding the legal fees, as others have said, that requiring council members to pay their own legal fees is going to chill the opportunity for people who can't afford to be volunteer council members to sign up for that.\nSpeaker 2: And so I think you need to be very careful going down that route. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Saylor.\nSpeaker 1: Then Robin TARULLO.\nSpeaker 2: My name is Doyle Saylor. Thank you for a moment to talk to mayor and city council members. I just want to say that I fully support Jim Odie and Melissa Bella. I will fight for them. And I think this is a politically motivated attack coming tonight and therefore I will be one to stand behind them.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Aiello.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Thank you. I'm here to support both Councilmember Jim Cody and Malia Vella. I believe, just as Mr. BOLLING mentioned, that the grand jury report is very flawed, as most of the grand jury reports are. But that's another story.\nSpeaker 3: And I just wanted to mention that they should be supported as they are a dedicated hard work, hard working council members that well represent their constituents as they were well voted into office. And we should remember all that as well.\nSpeaker 3: And if anything should be attended to them, it should be done at the ballot box and not any other way. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And our next speaker is.\nSpeaker 1: Catherine Behar with our tour, Rodriguez and Rock Herman.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, you're up. Hi.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name's Catherine. Mr. Santini and Mr. Matthew statements are absolutely correct. However, we asked for it before, but I find it curious that Ms.. Jill Climatique agrees to release the tape. Why won't Mr. Jim Oti and Ms..\nSpeaker 3: Melia Vella is it to telling the independent counsel never even heard the tape, but for $1 million? I believe we're entitled to hear it. I, for one, would love to have a listen.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. The next speaker is Arturo Rodriguez.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. Amateur RODRIGUEZ And I've had the opportunity to travel throughout the state and live in many different cities. And let me tell you that Alameda has one of, if not the best fire departments I've ever seen. I've seen them involved in the community like you wouldn't believe.\nSpeaker 2: And the professionalism that they take upon when they respond to their calls is amazing. So I feel disappointed in that they would be used as a pawn for a political attack on our council members that have been serving the city so well.\nSpeaker 2: And let me make note that for the record, when when they were asked to stand up to see in the crowd how many supported Jim and Malia, over 90% of the crowd stood up. And just for that, it is clear to me that this is a political attack.\nSpeaker 2: And and it's unfortunate that our public servants, the people that we call to rely on when something happens, is being used as a political attack. And it's kind of shameful. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Herman.\nSpeaker 2: I had a mayor. Council members. Well, here we are again talking about the tape and the firing and everything that ensued since then. And the public still hasn't heard that tape. And I think Cathy said you heard it.\nSpeaker 2: I'm not even sure that's true. So here we are after all this time and a million bucks down the drain. And the tape is still a secret, and it's a secret from more people than you want to acknowledge at this point.\nSpeaker 2: So we were previously led to believe it was illegal. In fact, that investigative report that I still hope you haven't paid for said verbatim. I don't want to listen to that tape because I don't want to abet a felony.\nSpeaker 2: Now we know now because the D.A. and the grand jury looked at that, that that was false. It was misleading. It was erroneous. So, Mr. City Attorney Russ hit on you for that, and I'm going to do the same.\nSpeaker 2: We need to see that tape out there. If there's nothing to hide, if the truth is the truth and the truth is on the tape, then the public needs to know. You've been selective in what's been released. This has already cost $1,000,000.\nSpeaker 2: A lot of things could be done with that. All of you stood in solidarity. Think of what that could have done for your programs and their all good programs. That's $1,000,000 you're not.\nSpeaker 0: Going to get, Mr. Herman, if you don't speak to the speaker, all the people watching on TV won't hear you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam Mayor. So the future involves the claim for legal fees. As I understand from a newspaper story, I didn't get to see the draft report. You seem to be enamored with relying on the investigative report for the conflict between whether one or both committed misconduct.\nSpeaker 2: And let's not forget that the investigative report thought that they did that a felony by listening to the tape. That can't be what happens in this case. You cannot rely on it. There would be further laughing stock for this council to produce something like that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Next is Catherine Pelling and Andrew Huntoon. And then that's our last Larry.\nSpeaker 0: Miss Poling, where are you? There. You're. And Mr. Huntoon. There you are. Okay. You're on deck.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Thank. Hello, Mayor and council. I want to go back to the statements that I made over a year ago when all of this was breaking. A city manager whose job is handling human resources. If somebody is acting in an inappropriate way, you call them on it and you stop it.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, this thing of turning this into sort of a witch hunt to overturn our more progressive council who is finally listening to working people and seniors and those of us who need it. And it's being turned into something else.\nSpeaker 3: Beyond, I feel like we're just going on and on in circles. It's not about the tape. It's about a really difficult thing that happened. The city manager thought it had to do with her employment, her her review, which turned out to be a delay because of staff workload.\nSpeaker 3: That was she was acting out of fear. She felt bullied. All of this, the city settled. That was it. We had an election after this event happened and we spoke very clearly. I'm very proud to have been part of a coalition of labor, of faith, of renters, of homeowners, of small business owners.\nSpeaker 3: We worked very hard in that election to elect people that would represent our views. And it would be wrong for that one unfortunate incident to suddenly remove the representatives that we elected. We ask that you've been working very strong and very well together and just six months you've accomplished a tremendous amount.\nSpeaker 3: I urge you to continue to stay strong, to work together. The jury, I'm very pleased. The grand jury determined no further accusatory action is needed. I think.\nSpeaker 0: That. Thank you. Mr. Huntoon, you're. Annette was our last speaker. If anyone still has something to say. I hesitate to say this between the speaker slip, Mr. Hinton.\nSpeaker 2: Council members, but fellow citizens. My name's Danny here. And to them, a lifelong Alameda resident. I wanted to point out that the loss of the city goes beyond the monetary $4 million that we seem to be so focused on and that we've lost confidence in our leaders.\nSpeaker 2: We've lost a legitimate role model that we should be looking to for our council members. You should all be in positions where we can say, I want my children to grow up to act like these people, and this is totally out of line.\nSpeaker 2: In addition to the monetary loss, we lost a city administrator that had the integrity and the backbone to stand up. And not only that, but to record this incident so that we could all hear what's been kept from us.\nSpeaker 2: These council members, many had their techniques, and we wonder how many times these tactics were not brought in, made public in additionally, this report that this whole meeting is about, that the response to the report appears to have been written by the lawyers that have been paid up to $200,000 to defend these people that don't need defending\nSpeaker 2: . That's my statement.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Hinton. And was it our last speaker?\nSpeaker 1: There's one more now. There's one.\nSpeaker 0: More speaker. Okay. His Marilyn.\nSpeaker 1: Bow.\nSpeaker 0: Is bow.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, hello. Thank you. I'm Marilyn.\nSpeaker 3: Bow. And this afternoon, I printed the grand jury executive summary. I want to read a part of it. Well, it's only two pages, so you can go to 2000 1819 Alameda County Grand Jury Final report. And this is Alameda City Council interference.\nSpeaker 3: In the middle, it says in the case of Alameda, two members of the city council violated the city charter. They took steps in the behest of a labor organization to push for its candidate by privately meeting with the city manager and pressing the issue.\nSpeaker 3: They also appeared to use the city manager performance review as leverage in the matter. Remember, this is the grand jury executive report. One councilmember went further by making an indirect threat to the city manager manager's job to a member of the city manager's leadership team.\nSpeaker 3: The same council member also wrote a letter using city letterhead, openly advocating for the labor backed candidate. These actions put the city manager in a very awkward position, creating a reasonable belief that her job was on the line if the Labor backed candidate was not selected.\nSpeaker 3: As a result, she took steps to publicly protest the inappropriate interference in the process. The city manager also sought to peacefully recorded the conversation. She helped the two council members out of fear of additional threats. So 39 seconds.\nSpeaker 3: I want to say after listening to everyone, it's clear they violate the city charter. I hope the city manager's listening. And it says if you do that, you have to be removed. So anyway, I just want to say that I read the grand jury report.\nSpeaker 3: We're not making it up. It's not a political witch hunt. I don't know why people are saying that. You can read it in black and white from a grand jury. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Ms.. Poe. And that is our final speaker. Okay. Public comment is now closed. And and I want to thank all of you who came and spoke. As you can see, on the very same set of facts, there is a wide range of of opinion and views.\nSpeaker 0: And in just a minute, this counsel, the three of us are going to have a discussion out in public. We are presumably going to have some findings. I want to just give my brief introduction. This regrettable chapter in our city's history came to the attention of the Alameda County Civil Grand Jury, whose legal authority allows it to\nSpeaker 0: inquire into charges that a public official engaged in willful misconduct while in office. The grand jury undertook an extensive investigation that included testimony from current and former city staff, elected officials and statewide governance experts. The grand jury's report found that the interference of two city council members in the city manager's hiring of a new fire chief violated\nSpeaker 0: the city charter and ultimately cost the city of Alameda more than $1,000,000. But the cost to the city was not just financial. Public trust in government was diminished, and our city's reputation has been tarnished. The executive summary of the Grand Jury report noted that the Alameda City County Charter is filled with rules and principles to ensure the\nSpeaker 0: effective and honest administration of government and plainly prohibits the City Council from interfering in the hiring process or trying to influence the city manager, and that this prohibition is common in municipal charters throughout our nation. It is intended to combat cronyism and corrupt government decisions.\nSpeaker 0: We cannot pretend that this series of events didn't happen or wish it away. The only way to bring closure to our city is to address the issue head on. It is imperative that we do so now because this Council has so many important issues to resolve, many of which are on tonight's agenda, including climate change, our aging\nSpeaker 0: infrastructure, homelessness, renter protections, improving transit, making our streets safer that require the full attention of this body. And I do mean this body of five, but the three of us now, before you have the opportunity and the responsibility with our responses to the grand jury's findings and recommendations to put this episode behind us, I am confident that\nSpeaker 0: our responses will support transparency and good governance and help restore the public's trust in our local government. And I just want to say quickly, my couple of side notes that I took while I was taking notes while all of you spoke, but a couple stood out for me.\nSpeaker 0: One of the things to remember is that people are complex and one person is many things. We are talking about a particular episode, a particular point in time. I will second what others have said. This Council. Since we were elected, I became mayor.\nSpeaker 0: It has been a pleasure to work with all of my colleagues. We have gotten a lot of things done. But again, as I said before, we cannot look away. We cannot pretend that the past didn't happen. We are being watched for our response and I think we can come through on the other side a better council and\nSpeaker 0: to set examples for this body and future bodies. And one of the points that the grand jury made in its report was that in some councils, a strong, capable mayor would have put a stop to to what was going on, but that that was not the case here.\nSpeaker 0: We have a different council now, and I believe that we are going to take this matter into hand and do the right thing. So we are not here to, as we previously said, remove our colleagues. That is not an option before us.\nSpeaker 0: We are not here to. Undo or demean any of the good work they have done. We have all done together to address some very important causes. But we have a grand jury report, findings and recommendations, and we're going to address that now on other council comments before we dig into the meat of the item before us.\nSpeaker 0: Do. I'm sorry. City council member did you want to comment?\nSpeaker 5: Well, my comment is whether it's. I'm just going to comment. So thank.\nSpeaker 0: You. Yeah. And then we'll get into I'm going to just so for the housekeeping details, what I propose to do as we go through the findings one by one and the recommendations one by one and the other little housekeeping detail.\nSpeaker 0: I talked to the city attorney earlier today. As I previously noted, we do impose a nine minute time limit on ourselves. I would like a motion out of necessity to just dispense with the time limit. We may not talk.\nSpeaker 0: Well, I mean, I've already done half mine, but I just feel that this is an important enough matter for the public to hear our deliberation, that we should be able to go over it. Our nine minute limit. Is that agreeable to my colleagues?\nSpeaker 6: So moved.\nSpeaker 0: A second. Was that a second? Okay. All in favor. I and so and because normally under our ordinance you would require four votes to approve this. But the city attorney explained to me, do you want to just put your legal explanation on there.\nSpeaker 12: Ma'am? Yes, Madam Mayor. So the council has imposed a rule upon itself. It's not an ordinance that each council councilmembers speak for 9 minutes. And given that the recusals at hand, I believe that the rule of necessity would apply.\nSpeaker 12: And and additionally, generally on procedural votes, even a majority of the minority of the Council present might be able to alter rules for process, not substance. All right. This is substance. And I do recommend unanimity in all these matters, given the council rules.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Shinn. Okay. So with that, do you want to make some comments, Councilmember per se.\nSpeaker 5: Let me begin by stating what I think are the principles at stake that the residents need to hear. These are the principles as I see them. The first principle is that no person is above the law and all are equal before the law.\nSpeaker 5: And the law of the land is the Alameda City Charter. To me, that's the first principle. Related to the first principle is a second principle that in our democracy here in Alameda takes the form of a professionally run city manager type of government and us having that form.\nSpeaker 5: Um. Was not an accident. That there was in 1936, 1937 here in Alameda, a similar, somewhat similar major crises that ultimately resulted in the district attorney and the superior court getting involved to ultimately remove the city manager at that time in 1936, as well as remove the mayor and two other council members.\nSpeaker 5: I believe the situation that's facing us is of a similar magnitude and that as council members for the residents here and also for the generations of residents, much in the way some look back at 1936, 1937, that we need to indicate to here and to the future that our local government will still be a professionally run city\nSpeaker 5: manager form of government. It wasn't by accident that that that we we have that and it wasn't by accident that our city charter was reformed in 1937. So our predecessors fought hard for the type of government that we have.\nSpeaker 5: Above all. We are reminded all about our history books, about Tammany Hall cronyism. And that's what that's the principle at stake is whether we're going to have a professionally run city manager form of government. But I also think the biggest principle at stake is that no person is above the law and that we're all equal before the\nSpeaker 5: law and that the law of the land is the city charter. There are specific details that we are going to respond to after our kind of opening statements. And my hope is that as we move forward on the particular findings and the recommendations that that that we not read more into the grand jury report beyond what is\nSpeaker 5: already there in plain, simple English. So. That we not quibble over about over facts or the way in which certain matters are characterized or not. The grand jury report and its findings are what they are, and we are being asked to respond to them in black or white, yes or no?\nSpeaker 5: And I think we deserve. We owe it to future residents of Alameda that we. That we do so. So there will be more things that I want to touch on. But let me just say, there were some items that were discussed this evening which I hope to have a discussion over regarding access to tapes, regarding censure, regarding\nSpeaker 5: making information available, and. I hope to have a discussion about those as well as what's before us with regard to the grand jury report.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember de SAC by summary. Not quite. You want to make any comment?\nSpeaker 6: Sure. I bet I have. Just a couple quick questions I want to ask. Councilmember de SAC reminded me that I wanted to ask about there's been talk about tonight about releasing the tape, that that is not something we could do tonight.\nSpeaker 6: Correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Audience. Audience. You've been stellar up till now. The city attorney is going to answer that question. We will get out of here on the same day we started if you don't do the audience participation thing.\nSpeaker 12: Mr. SHINN Councilmember That's correct. The agenda item we have not agenda is this as an item to consider that particular action by the Council.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. And then and I'm not sure who to ask this question of, but since it came up a couple of times, it relates to the independent Jenkins report. I think I'm going to look at I never get to call in the city clerk, but is the is the one executive staff who was here at the time that\nSpeaker 6: the grand jury report says that there were problems with allowing the editing. But at the end of the day, a decision by the council was to release the original document, plus the Arata sheet, which was the changes that were proposed.\nSpeaker 6: Is that correct? And we talked. But to your knowledge, there is no there was no other draft that was presented of the full report of the hundred page report that was edited and never seen redacted to keep names and things out.\nSpeaker 1: But correct. That original report is the same first original report the council read.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thank you. This is not a not a fun conversation. Know when I was asked, how do you want to handle this? I said I wasn't here. I don't want I don't want to have to deal with it.\nSpeaker 6: But it's clearly not an option. I come at this from my knowledge. For the most part, it comes from two reports that were written and with a couple of degrees of difference, come to similar conclusions. Both one finds that what?\nSpeaker 6: Both find that when city manager or city councilmember violated the charter and the other one of the other two finds the same, I think any careful reading of the document finds. I can identify that the grand jury report does not say that both members were at the same level in the spectrum of of of influence, etc. They\nSpeaker 6: specifically call that out. Both documents recommend not moving forward with removal. And as somebody who has to come at this from reading the reports and knowing that people are looking at that I am I tonight am here to accept this.\nSpeaker 6: I do agree that there needs to be some acknowledgment that things did not go the way they were supposed to. We would not be sitting here if they had. You know, I'm not going to. It is true that some people are using these reports for political purposes.\nSpeaker 6: At the same time, you know, I am ready tonight to actually just vote, to agree on all four of the findings and more or less accept the recommendations of the grand jury. I personally don't feel that I need a lot of conversation about that.\nSpeaker 6: And in the end, I do think it's important for our community. We are at the end of the process tonight. This is the this is the. Somebody asked, when does this end? Tonight is the end. There is no unless we don't agree.\nSpeaker 6: And we have to come back in September and start the conversation over again, which, trust me, I don't want to do. And my guess is my council member council friends don't want to as well. You know, tonight is the end of the process.\nSpeaker 6: We went through the process. We had the opportunity to have the grand jury look at this. They looked at this. They did not recommend for either council member that they be removed. To me, that suggests that there is a spectrum that influence interference happens on.\nSpeaker 6: And they did not feel that that spectrum was crossed to the extent that that anybody could go to a to the D.A. and be successful and be having a chance of success for removal from office through that process.\nSpeaker 6: And so I you know, I have to accept that. I think we have to be very careful not to accept certain parts of the report and ignore others. Both reports show a city in chaos. Have you read the 100 page Jenkins report?\nSpeaker 6: It shows just absolute chaos across across the organization. The grand jury basically that basically specifically said everybody played a role in this. But we're we we were asked to look at the two council members. And I think we have to own that.\nSpeaker 6: So, you know, it hurts me. I understand when people sit here and say, we have we the three of us have lost your trust. I understand that. And that is a reasonable thing. On the other hand, the three of us were not a part of that grand jury report.\nSpeaker 6: Tony and I hadn't even been elected. We weren't here when it happened. Two of the other people who were here and it takes three votes to kind of make things happen. So I have questions about why some of this didn't get dealt with before now.\nSpeaker 6: But for me tonight, I'm ready to move forward. I would like to see us kind of quickly move forward, put this, you know, accept the findings and put this behind us.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. As much as you know, I also wish we weren't dealing with this. We don't have a way to turn back the clock. But here we are now. And as I often say, we play the hand were dealt.\nSpeaker 0: And so what I propose to do is go through we've all read this report probably several times. The grand jury has made four findings 19 Dash one, two, 19 Dash.\nSpeaker 3: Four and four.\nSpeaker 0: Closely related recommendations as well. Let's take a look at the first one, which is 19 dash one, finding 19 dash one. If you're in the staff report, it's page two of four. So the city of Alameda is failure to provide council members with adequate training upon first being elected to city council as well as annual training on\nSpeaker 0: governance helped contribute to an inappropriate interference in the fire chief hiring process. I have trouble agreeing with this finding completely. I think it is a good thing to have training. I know that our council, our city, offers and pays for new council members and in fact, new mayors to attend the League of California Cities boot boot camp\nSpeaker 0: , they call it, for elected officials in Sacramento. Some people avail themselves of that opportunity. Others don't. We do all swear an oath when we're sworn into office to uphold the charter, and presumably one would read and know what it was they were agreeing to uphold.\nSpeaker 0: I am also mindful of the fact and the vice mayor just noted this, that anything we decide tonight has to be by unanimous vote, because we, a majority of the council, no matter how many are sitting at the dais, is three.\nSpeaker 0: In some cases, if we were doing a conveyance of real property, we would need four votes. But so we have to we have to come to agreement. And I don't see the the benefit of coming back in September because I'm not sure what would happen in those intervening weeks.\nSpeaker 0: But Councilmember Desai, can I ask you to weigh in on finding 19 dash one?\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\nSpeaker 5: On finding on the findings, will you will find that my approach is, for the most part, the same and three out of four so far for finding number 19 dash one. I believe we should just keep it simple.\nSpeaker 5: As I said from in in my outset, I said, let us not read more into the grand jury report beyond what is already there in plain English. So by keeping it simple, my recommendation is simply to write a letter.\nSpeaker 5: In our letter that we transmit that we indicate that the following we agree with the finding that 19 dash one comma, which comma in summary form indicates that. And this and that and the wording that's there.\nSpeaker 0: If I could just point out it for the finding, for each finding, it is required that the response shall either be agree or disagree wholly with an explanation or disagree partially with an explanation.\nSpeaker 5: So agree.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So this is one of these areas where I think it's it's probably more important to get this report back to the grand jury with our finding. I think in general, in principle, a new council members should have training, but not all council members are created equal.\nSpeaker 0: And I do believe my two council colleagues we are discussing are very smart, talented attorneys. Their background and experience has been noted. But if what you're saying council member did so, is that for the good of this organization moving forward with this process, do you think we should just agree this is.\nSpeaker 5: This finding, in my opinion. While it speaks mostly, I think, to the larger body of council members and while the larger body of council members, myself included, would rather not be implicated in in this, nonetheless accepting it, I'm not going to lose sleep over or over acknowledging that, yeah, we need we need better training.\nSpeaker 5: So I'm fine with the findings of 19 dash one as. As written. I you know, I don't see any necessity to amplify it one way or another. I don't see any necessary necessity to introduce something called the Jenkins Report and all that.\nSpeaker 5: I just just accept it.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. Thank you for sharing that. And Vice Mayor Knox White, I suspect you feel.\nSpeaker 6: I would concur.\nSpeaker 0: The same. Okay. So so with that then and actually what I'm also going to propose is that we take a vote on each each one of these items, just so it's clear for the record. So, Madam Clerk, and where we may have times where we're actually going to do some editing of the the letter that's in the\nSpeaker 0: staff report, in this case, the editing is just delete, delete, delete all. Okay. Is it okay? It's up before us now. Yeah. Okay. So. But I would say it is simply agree. And the bottom paragraph. While the city of Alameda currently provides area at it, it's just degree that goes so, so moved.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. So so.\nSpeaker 6: You're on a.\nSpeaker 0: Vote.\nSpeaker 5: And let me explain. This is a finding. It's in the recommendations where we're going to, you know, give meet to.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Okay. Right. Right, right. Okay. So. So we have a motion. You want to second that? Okay. We have a motion. And second, all in favor. I, I look at that unanimity. Okay. We will move on then. So let me ask it a little differently.\nSpeaker 0: We'll still take separate votes. Does anybody on the findings? 19 Dash Tuna, 19 Dash three and 19 dash four have other than an agree that they want to offer.\nSpeaker 5: This is the one where I do have there's a slight march which.\nSpeaker 0: Went.\nSpeaker 5: 19 dash to is the one where I would I do have a slight modification to the language because the language that's in there right now does not accurately characterize the charter review process that's underway.\nSpeaker 0: And go ahead. And then before I interrupt, you could to explain.\nSpeaker 5: As a council, we made the decision to bifurcate the charter implications resulting from Councilmember Avella and Councilmember Otis actions in 2017. We made a decision to bifurcate that from the charter review process that is described in the in the in the, in the draft letter.\nSpeaker 5: And the agreement was that that council itself would take on the matter of what kind of the remedies that we would come up with to deal with the seven, specifically to deal with a7-3 step.\nSpeaker 0: So Councilmember Daza, if I could just interject that this is a finding. And so it is talking about the city of our need is charter at this point in time, at the point in time where the grand jury reviewed the charter in conjunction with their investigation.\nSpeaker 0: And so I think your points would perhaps be better applied when we come to the recommendations. I'm just talking about the finding. Finding 19 dash to the city of Almeida's charter fails to provide enforcement mechanisms when council members and staff violate provisions of the of the charter, creating uncertainty when such violations occur.\nSpeaker 5: It's just that let me be.\nSpeaker 0: Clear, Councilmember Desai.\nSpeaker 5: In the draft letter to Judge Carvell under finding 19 Dash two currently we have before us two options. Well, I would not move forward with option two. What I'm saying is option one has kind of it doesn't tell the full story of what we're doing, that's all.\nSpeaker 6: Can I make a recommendation?\nSpeaker 0: I actually I just want to clarify that because this actually bothered me about the staff report. If all we were being asked to do, if we agreed, was to agree with that explanation, I think the and I know staff was well and trying to capture a lot of different views.\nSpeaker 0: But I don't again, that that verbiage doesn't belong in the explanation of the finding. It belongs over in the recommendation.\nSpeaker 5: The words are used where you were.\nSpeaker 6: I was just going to propose that we just say response. Agree.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. End of story. Much in the same way. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Would that be a motion?\nSpeaker 6: That would be my motion.\nSpeaker 0: Would there be a second? Second? All right, all in favor. Okay. So the response to 19, Dash two, Madam Clerk, who's our scribe, is just agree.\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So moving on, finding 19 Dash three from the grand jury is council members who were the obvious subjects of the independent investigation were allowed to participate in the editing of the outside investigators report, damaging the independence of the analysis.\nSpeaker 0: And again, I'm just going to voice my disagreement with going into the explanation in the draft letter that, well, you know, it might have, but then we released the report, but that would be arguing that then we released the flawed report.\nSpeaker 0: So again, I think this one is just an agree or maybe it's not.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Let me member decide.\nSpeaker 5: For if there's any frustration on the part of the public here or the viewing public. My reaction to the findings is that where the real meat on the bones occurs is in our response to the recommendations section. So there are four recommendations section, and that's separate from the findings section.\nSpeaker 5: So if somehow you feel like, wait, all they're doing is saying yes to 2 to 19, that's 119. That's to 19, actually 19. That's four. Yes, we are doing that. But only because, you know, if you're not ready to accept the findings.\nSpeaker 5: Doesn't that say something? And if you're going to quibble over the findings, does that say something about your, you know, follow through potential when it comes to recommendations? So at a minimum, let us at least accept the findings.\nSpeaker 5: And that is for that reason I'm suggesting that we not, as I said from the outset, that we not read too much language into it. Let's just accept it. I mean, it was a historic and the findings are historic unto themselves.\nSpeaker 0: Would you like to make a motion?\nSpeaker 5: Agree. I agree with finding number 19, dash three.\nSpeaker 0: So you so you move that our response to 1993 will be agree. So second.\nSpeaker 6: Second.\nSpeaker 0: All in favor. I oppose abstain motion carries unanimously. Okay. The fourth and last finding in violation of the city's charter they had sworn to uphold. Two council members did interfere with the city manager's ability to conduct an open and transparent recruitment for a new fire chief.\nSpeaker 2: It them.\nSpeaker 0: Every day.\nSpeaker 5: So let me throw in one more qualifying comment. I am of the opinion that as a council member when I agree with finding that 19 days for that in plain English says in violation of the city charter these two these two council members had sworn to uphold.\nSpeaker 5: Two council members did interfere. I am of the opinion that I am making sending a straightforward message that we did not agree with the actions that had occurred in 2017 and subsequent to that. So I believe that maybe in agree using one word agree to finding 19 dash four.\nSpeaker 5: To me, one word is as powerful as 100 words or 200 words. So that's why. I'm okay with just agreeing with 19 dash four and one through three.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And again, our options are agree, disagree wholly or disagree partially. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 6: So I will move approval of our response being agree.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. I will second that. Now, let me make sure to say when I'm responding to agree, I am not accepting the verbiage. It's just a we agree. That's okay. Thank you. Thank you. The second.\nSpeaker 0: What does that mean?\nSpeaker 4: Well, it's nice to see the way the way.\nSpeaker 5: That the draft letter is written. And then there's.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, you know, and I'm so and also with three. I do want you to get rid of the additional verbiage. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: I did. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Oh, you're doing that? Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And it's on our screen. It's just a little smaller. Okay, so you made a motion and you seconded, right? Okay. All in favor. Hi. Okay. So the findings are all unanimous. And again, they're all one word responses. No explanations.\nSpeaker 0: You're having a little technical difficulty. Your I will just noted that the vice mayor was actually going to make it even simpler by just saying findings 19 dash one through 19 dash.\nSpeaker 1: For agree agree.\nSpeaker 0: To all. I hate it when he shows me up like that. You're not kidding. Okay, let's move then to the recommendations. I'm vice mayor. Do you want to take the lead on that? Sure.\nSpeaker 6: I believe similarly. So I wrote up some notes here. I believe we need to I believe we should accept the recommendations. I would change some of the language because I think that the proposed language, which I believe is for the most part, an option one each time, suggests that things have not been done when actually we have\nSpeaker 6: been taking action on some of these things before the grand jury report came out. So on on 19 Dash one, I would recommend that our response be this recommendation will be implemented in the near future. Staff City staff expects to return to the council at an agenda sized public meeting within the next six months to provide recommendations\nSpeaker 6: on implementation of this policy.\nSpeaker 0: And just for the benefit of the audience that might not be following along. Recommendation one is that the the City Council must establish policies for mandating initial training in orientation and ongoing training for elected officials and senior staff related to ethics and governance.\nSpeaker 5: Councilmember de so I am of the opinion that the so now this is where we start putting meat on the bones, you know, so, so this is where we start putting meat on the bones. I am of the opinion that the response should be the following.\nSpeaker 5: The City of Alameda will implement strategies and develop a work plan for implementation. City staff will return to council at an agenda public meeting for update and discussion. Not more than six months after this, Will says, we will do it, it, it, it, it it confirms that we are taking this seriously and we're giving ourselves a timeline\nSpeaker 5: . Not, I believe the phraseology of will conduct additional research on implementation.\nSpeaker 0: It's a little yeah, we were we were getting rid of their verbiage. That was. Although Madam click are you how how's that working?\nSpeaker 1: Well, if I wanted to allow you guys to deliberate, I didn't want to type something until you've had consensus or. I mean, if you want me to just try and type both options and then have them up, I.\nSpeaker 0: Can you read back what Councilmember De Sykes said? I feel like it might be the same thing the vice mayor said, but with a little.\nSpeaker 1: More.\nSpeaker 0: Affirmative dramatic.\nSpeaker 1: Type it. But I think if you go a little bit far I could type it as you say it can you could you reread it again. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Slowly this time.\nSpeaker 5: Scratch sentence one recommendation 19 dash one requires further analysis. No. The new will read as follows The city of Alameda will implement strategies and develop a work plan for implementation. City staff will return to council at an agenda meeting.\nSpeaker 5: And. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Was there a timeframe?\nSpeaker 5: Well, maybe six months. I mean, not more than six says not more than six months. I'm going to work within that. Not more than six months.\nSpeaker 6: Now.\nSpeaker 0: Is that reasonable stuff? Yeah. Well, you wrote it. This is true. Why am I asking you that? And I mean, I do think that it is important. It's part of the closure that we address this soon. But, you know, you you all should feel free to chime in if you have some things that you want us to\nSpeaker 0: hear. Okay. You know, city attorney, the city clerk, city attorney.\nSpeaker 12: I just want to add one point of a technical point, please. Penal code requires that if we are going this route, which is that the recommendation will be implemented, we must lead the sentence with the recommendation has not been implemented.\nSpeaker 12: Okay. Okay. So we must lead with that. But then we can.\nSpeaker 0: Continue.\nSpeaker 12: With the the city of Alameda will implement the protocol requires a leading phrase that it has not been implemented. And I apologize.\nSpeaker 0: That's why we have a city attorney sitting here. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: So and that was exactly my question. There are the same there is multiple options that you have to use. And that's exactly what I was going to ask about.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, I would say let's keep it legal. So on the recommendations, yes, please use the the responses with the necessary language and in the first sentence, but then.\nSpeaker 6: Essentially an option to. But Councilmember De Sung has said instead of city staff expects to return to council, the city staff will return to council.\nSpeaker 1: The recommendation does not that will be.\nSpeaker 6: Then essentially when he proposed his option to with the meeting.\nSpeaker 0: So cities have yet down an option to.\nSpeaker 1: Of got it here is that little.\nSpeaker 0: Farther down option to.\nSpeaker 1: I thought Councilmember de SAC said will see development and will implement strategies and develop a plan. Climate mobilization. Sorry that little thing daily and city staff will and then sentence above is what the city attorney needed added. Correct.\nSpeaker 1: So option two goes away.\nSpeaker 6: Oh, that's fine.\nSpeaker 5: No, no. Option two does go away. It might. The changes that I indicate are for option one. The City of Alameda will implement and develop.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. The option one just.\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, the word option. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. Okay. So that first sentence has two states has the state.\nSpeaker 1: Just pulled up the sentence from option two that the city attorney indicated was needed? So is that correct? Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 1: Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Good. Good with you. Okay. So do we vote to approve this language?\nSpeaker 6: So moved.\nSpeaker 0: Council member. Dave Oh yeah. Second rate all in favor of this wording before us. I think that passed unanimously. So we go on to recommendation to city clerk. You want to read the recommendations?\nSpeaker 1: They are going to count. City Council must investigate possible charter or municipal code amendments to clarify and strengthen provisions relating to city governance. The Charter should delineate the specific types of conduct that constitute a violation of Section seven, Dash three, as well as outline an enforcement process.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So who wants to lead on this one?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. Just.\nSpeaker 0: Oh. City manager, Mr. Lovett.\nSpeaker 4: So we had. So I was thinking that on your statement 19 dash one the you were saying six months from when. Tonight. But city attorney was saying that it would be six months from the issuance. So I would ask that you say six months from.\nSpeaker 4: The day, the letter, which is tonight. That way, if it ends up going to the end of December or first week of January or January, we don't we aren't in violation of your statement. I'm hoping to be sooner, but just in case.\nSpeaker 0: Six months from the date of this letter. Is that what you're saying?\nSpeaker 4: That's what I'm requesting.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So six months. It's July. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Are you okay with that?\nSpeaker 5: Yes, I'm fine with that.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. So now. Okay, we've just heard recommendation 19, dash two. So, uh, anybody want to.\nSpeaker 5: I said my recommendation on recommendation 19. Dash two is to start off with language that. That ignore that that says that we the city of Alameda agrees with recommendation 19, dash two and then all the language that you see in there.\nSpeaker 5: But then at the word at the end of the word enforcement process, period. Add the following phraseology as well as outline and enforcement. Process. Process perron such as? Censure. Comma City Council sponsored recall. Karma. Etc..\nSpeaker 6: I would prefer to keep details of this out, I think. I think that we're getting well ahead of ourselves.\nSpeaker 1: Limits of my touch.\nSpeaker 0: So hold that thought. I actually worked on this one a little since it was I who named the subcommittee. The two of you. So what I said, and you can just listen to this, and if you don't like it, we'll do something else.\nSpeaker 0: But I said, whatever the magic language is, we need to hit first magic language. And then upon being sworn into office in December 2018, Mayor Maryland, as he Ashcraft noted that quote, I have this that I can hand you to Laura in quotation in Alameda, The public trust has been shaken by turbulent events of this past year\nSpeaker 0: period. We need to restore public trust and make city government more effective. One place to start is by bringing our city charter in line with current day needs and realities. Close quote. Mayor, as he Ashcraft established a city charter subcommittee consisting of Vice Mayor Knox, Wade and Councilmember desire to review the city charter and return to the\nSpeaker 0: council with proposed changes and amendments to provide greater guidance and clarity to city officials, staff and the public. So I would I believe the two of you as a subcommittee are still doing your work, and I believe you're going to come back to that in the fall to the council with these proposals.\nSpeaker 0: So rather than wordsmithing what those proposals would be, you could bring them back to us in a package at that time. But your thoughts?\nSpeaker 5: Okay. I hear what you're saying. And let me just first address my concern about this goes to what I was saying from the outset, the paragraph that begins on March 16th, 2019, the charter review process. That whole paragraph only tells part of the story of the charter review process.\nSpeaker 5: And if we're going to have that paragraph in there, and I think this is important, we also have to have a separate paragraph that says as part of that, something along the lines of as part of the charter review process, city council as a whole agreed to separate out the the situations that led up to 7-3 violations\nSpeaker 5: and the possible remedies to that. And that the city council would have a week because we said we ourselves were going to have a conversation about the remedies. So that's where where we would begin to address, you know, should it be censure or should it be a city council sponsored recall or whatever.\nSpeaker 5: So that is a missing paragraph because.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Let's hear from your subcommittee member.\nSpeaker 6: Well, I was. I was. Yeah, I was okay with the language you proposed. It didn't actually have any this kind of what I would call extraneous. The workshop wasn't about this item. It feels odd to even mention it, even though it did happen.\nSpeaker 6: We did a lot of work, but it didn't talk about this issue. I like the idea that we have a subcommittee. You and I are working on it. We're going to bring back some recommendations for discussion at the City Council at an agenda meeting in the fall.\nSpeaker 6: I think that's kind of what we're and that's what we're doing. I think it basically says we're on it and we're moving it forward.\nSpeaker 5: I agree. Then I think, though, that for purposes of the residence and for the purpose of giving clarity to the grand jury, because also we the judge is going to be looking at this and say, okay, what's the timeline when they're going to get it done?\nSpeaker 5: We again, have to give a timeline as to.\nSpeaker 0: So you'd go with my language if we could put in a timeline.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Where does that go and what do we say? Yeah, you're right.\nSpeaker 6: To provide greater guidance and clarity to city officials, staff and the public. The work is expected to return to the council.\nSpeaker 0: Will return.\nSpeaker 5: Will return.\nSpeaker 6: Will exactly.\nSpeaker 0: Will return.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. Yes. The next update and discussion will return to the full council in early fall 2019. For consideration. You know, it will be considered to put before the voters in 2020. Right. Oh, that's good.\nSpeaker 0: Good clarification. So so when we're talking about amending the charter, this is done by a vote of the people. So it is not something that this council can sit here tonight and do or when we come back in September.\nSpeaker 0: But among the things they're looking at, they're looking at a number of things that may go on the ballot in 2020, either the March primary or the June general election. So you'd be coming back to us in six months with those recommendations?\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, I think the last time the council discussed this, we decided not March because it's nothing on the just to set expectations. There's nothing local on the March ballot. So it would be an $800,000 addition for us to join, whereas it's much cheaper for us to go next November.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, I'd say that conversation is still taking place in different quarters, but yeah.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: I'll tell you that.\nSpeaker 5: Well, several things let me make sure to capture. I mean, my thoughts are that, you know, if we're going to reference the city charter review process, that we then need to clarify that that we had bifurcated the process that we, in an effort to take seriously, take in an effort to take seriously by the city council members\nSpeaker 5: the 7-3 item, which is has to do with the charter that says you can't interfere in job selections, hiring selections. And that I think we should also have language that says that city that the charter review committee will return to the city council as a whole with our recommendations with regard to 7-3 violations and again giving the\nSpeaker 5: timeline. And I think it gives and I think that's important because we as a council have have decided to separate out 7-3 from the other charter review process. By the way, the other charter I.\nSpeaker 6: Don't think that was actually the council that was you and I as the subcommittee.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And I will just I will just interject that I don't really think the presiding judge cares about bifurcation. I think that Judge Carvell just cares about what we're going to do with regard to recommendation 19, Dash two.\nSpeaker 6: Can we just can we can we just the one thing that's not overly overly clear, right? It just so if we go back to the the subcommittee will return will continue their work providing regular updates to the city council and consideration of potential changes to the charter on this issue.\nSpeaker 6: Right. So that we're being clear for consideration of presentation to voters in 2020. The next update in discussion by the full Council is expected will occur in early fall 2019.\nSpeaker 0: Can that be said with fewer words? Probably skip every window did. I mean, we just want to let the judge know that the subcommittee work is continuing. I mean, do you anticipate more than one update or do you think you're going to be ready to come forward with a recommendation?\nSpeaker 5: Councilmember Desai whatever the recommendations are. Again, going back to what I said from the outset, I want to respond to the plain text reading of what the grand jury report says and the plain text reading of recommendation 19.\nSpeaker 5: Dash two specifically calls out some kind of response to seven, Dash three. So all I'm saying is that that.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 5: When we say we're coming back with charter review amendments, we have to specifically say how we're going to come back, that we're going to come back with Charter Review Amendments two seven, Dash three that align with the concerns raised in recommending that recommendation 19 Dash two those concerns being the need to clarify and the need to strengthen\nSpeaker 0: . Right. And I would just tend to delineate the specific types of conduct that constitute a violation of 7-3, as well as outline and enforcement process. So you all are going to work on that in the subcommittee. Okay.\nSpeaker 5: And let me let me just for the edification of the public, because the charter review process has coming down the pike deals with. District voting deals with ranked choice voting and to other items. So I don't want us just to think that and those things that I just enumerated are not related to 7-3.\nSpeaker 5: So I want to be clear to the judge or whomever that we will. You know.\nSpeaker 6: It just. I agree. Can we just can we just add that to the the language? And I think we're I think we're all saying the same thing and we're all in agreement. So if we can just get that written, maybe we can just vote to move this thing forward.\nSpeaker 6: Because I'm mindful of the fact we have far more media, three or four media items.\nSpeaker 0: And it's ten, 1030. Okay, almost. What do you have, madam? Close to what? I think we need to give you a quick a little more direction on what we're.\nSpeaker 1: Going to need. The same first sentence in the response, right? Yep. Oh, let me. I'm right here. Okay. And then I. So we're we we're sticking with this. Are we going with what they may have read you? I know we're talking to the end of it, but the beginning part she's I keep on hitting that.\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: You know, I feel like let's go with whatever is shorter. Okay. Well, I would I don't want that second paragraph about everything that happened on March 16th. So just delete that, please.\nSpeaker 6: Can we can we change in recent months to in December 2018?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yeah. And to start in December 2018.\nSpeaker 6: And then and then at the.\nSpeaker 0: End, the mayor established a subcommittee. Yeah.\nSpeaker 6: The. Let's see. So, yeah, they arrested the city officials, staff and the public. The subcommittee will return.\nSpeaker 1: Just go right to that.\nSpeaker 6: To the full city council.\nSpeaker 0: That last sentence.\nSpeaker 6: With proposed changes to seven. Dash three.\nSpeaker 1: The suits will return. Oh, jeez. I'm really bad at this keyboard. Maybe I'll go to other keyboards. I would kill.\nSpeaker 0: She's doing well where? I didn't see where that.\nSpeaker 6: This is what I read more or less earlier.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 5: And I was.\nSpeaker 6: Just saying, if it got typed, then we can. So.\nSpeaker 5: In the in the language that was just mentioned now. I would mimic the language that's in the grand jury report. Don't just say return with changes to seven, dash three. I would say, well, come return with changes that clarify and strengthen and outline an enforcement process with regard to 7-3.\nSpeaker 5: That's what the language says. So.\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think the prescriptive part of that paragraph is the charter should delineate the specific types of conduct constitute a violation as well as outline enforcement. So that's what I would be looking for you to bring back. And then I think by doing that, you're satisfying the direction in the previous sentence.\nSpeaker 0: So I would.\nSpeaker 5: An enforcement process clarifies and strengthens as.\nSpeaker 0: No, I would say if I were doing it, I would say that the subcommittee will return with a report delineating the specific types of conduct as well as outlining, you know, dot, dot, dot, as well as outlining an enforcement process.\nSpeaker 0: And I think by doing that, you're satisfying the clarity and strengthening that the grand jury is asking for recommending.\nSpeaker 6: I say instead of a report. Can we say a proposal? I don't know that it's going to be a report. I think it's going to be a proposal. It's a potential language for discussion.\nSpeaker 0: Proposal.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 5: Problem with that. And it's a problem that's inherent in the way that the grand jury wrote this report. So the way the recommendation the third paragraph reads, the third paragraph reads the recommendation 19 dash two sentence to the charter should delineate the specific types of conduct that constitute a violation of Section seven, DASH three.\nSpeaker 6: I think we're starting to violate the getting into the weeds. I don't think we have to be so precise, so prescriptive as to I think the idea with responses to grand jury stuff at work on a regular basis because the San Francisco grand jury is very, very well busy.\nSpeaker 6: And and I think that this would be this would be a fine. I think they just want to hear we're going to look we're looking at it, we're coming back and it's in motion.\nSpeaker 0: I think that satisfies.\nSpeaker 5: For my to be satisfied that I'm trying to convey something to the public. What I'm trying to convey is this in in my delineating seven, dash three as said here, my effort is not to re change the plain text language of 7-3 that says neither the Council nor any members shall interfere with the execution of the city\nSpeaker 5: managers. Not to change that, nor is it to change an attempt by a council member to influence the city manager in the making of. So by delineating, I don't anticipate changing that. I anticipate focusing on enforcement processes because that's what's that and.\nSpeaker 0: We're saying that councilmember de so that's that sentence that right there the subcommittee will return to council with the proposal delineating the specific types of misconduct that constitute a violation of Section seven three, as well as outlining an enforcement process not more than six months after the date of this letter.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. I appreciate that. I just have to say it out loud.\nSpeaker 1: Great.\nSpeaker 0: But you don't need the language in the letter, right? Great. Do we have a motion to accept that wording moved.\nSpeaker 5: Second all.\nSpeaker 0: In favor. I. Okay, that pass. Let's move on to 19 dash three. Okay. So 19 dash three. I will read it. The American City Council should adopt a policy stating that council members who knowingly violate ethical codes of conduct or charter provisions may not seek reimbursement for related legal representation.\nSpeaker 0: Thoughts. Comments.\nSpeaker 6: And now that I understand the has not been implemented, I would propose we just go straight with option number two. It has the timeline. It says it's going to implement this thing, it will implement this.\nSpeaker 0: And I have a question for the city attorney then this came up with in some of the comments. Is there a reason we can't implement a change now.\nSpeaker 12: Because it's not agenda? Madam Chair, the agenda provides that the.\nSpeaker 0: Council for the response.\nSpeaker 12: The Council is providing guidance for the response of the Council wishes to actually implement the policy. We should agenda set for a future meeting.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And is it necessary to wait and looking back through the responses. Is it necessary to wait for what do we say, six months.\nSpeaker 6: And expects to return within?\nSpeaker 0: Um. Is it possible? I mean, do we have to have everything come back at the same time in six months or could some things come back sooner?\nSpeaker 12: No, everything does not need to come back all in one package. They could come back piecemeal. I will defer to the city manager on timeframes.\nSpeaker 0: City manager, your thoughts?\nSpeaker 4: For this particular this particular one. Yeah. So in some ways. This is for this particular one. So in some ways.\nSpeaker 0: She didn't speak into the microphone. So everyone captures what you saw.\nSpeaker 4: So in some ways, this is probably the some of the others are going to take more length in some of the research or how well developed the policies in this one. This one is probably a little more complex than that as as you as a city council know and dealing with litigation.\nSpeaker 4: Anytime there's claims, there's always things. So I think it could come back probably in four months and then you could have a discussion on it. I mean, probably I would say. For four months. I mean. There's always all these nuances on any type of litigation.\nSpeaker 4: So because this is talking about future claims. So there's always there's anticipated issues on litigation.\nSpeaker 0: And.\nSpeaker 12: Mr. Shen I think to add to the city manager's comment, I think that I'll echo his concern that given that there are ongoing claims that this policy may or may not implicate city managers wisely, advising some cost prudence and giving us sufficient time to get to the right place.\nSpeaker 12: I think we're coming back within six months, and I think I heard the city manager say as soon as possible. But giving us additional latitude is a wise decision.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And of course, we don't discuss pending litigation in open session, but we also don't want to do anything that would jeopardize pending litigation.\nSpeaker 12: Precisely.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So that said.\nSpeaker 5: So.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Desai, would you like to comment?\nSpeaker 5: So my druthers with this is similar to what we said before is something along the lines of. Option two as modified. This recommendation has not yet been implemented, but will be implemented in the future. The City Council at an agenda public meeting within the next.\nSpeaker 5: Eight months, six months will provide recommendations, will implement that will implement this policy. We're being asked to implement something historic has happened and we're being asked to change our policies. So we need to rise to the level of the historical importance.\nSpeaker 0: We're being asked to adopt a policy. We have none at this point.\nSpeaker 5: Exactly. But I'm saying we're going to commit to it.\nSpeaker 0: And I think I heard the city manager say it could come back within four months. But do the two of you concur on that?\nSpeaker 4: As I said.\nSpeaker 0: Enthusiasm is palpable.\nSpeaker 2: I said for you.\nSpeaker 4: I said four months that we can come back with options for you to consider.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. All right. So let's. Okay. So. Instruments will, yes. Provide recommendations.\nSpeaker 1: If you just like.\nSpeaker 6: We aren't going to implement this in four months, that's not what's being recommended.\nSpeaker 0: We'll will provide recommendations for implementation of this policy. Derek Kilmer deserves.\nSpeaker 5: I just think we should do what we have to. When we devise a policy, we have to implement it. So we will we will implement a policy. Right. So there's no need to say provide recommendations to implement. We will adopt a policy one way or another.\nSpeaker 5: Right.\nSpeaker 4: So we will you as a city council always have the option whether you don't adopt a policy.\nSpeaker 5: But the thing is, we don't have options here. We do. It's the grand jury thing that you will adopt if you agree with the findings, which we did. You will adopt a policy. So we have to adopt a policy.\nSpeaker 4: I'm not sure if it's that clear.\nSpeaker 6: But that's not.\nSpeaker 0: How it works. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 6: I, I'm fine with. I intend to adopt to work to adopt a policy. The grand jury does not direct our work and cannot compel us to adopt a policy. They are saying that they are recommending that we are doing it and we are telling them we intend to do that.\nSpeaker 6: We are planning to do that. And a year from now, if for whatever reason, we can't get to a policy that we like or there's legal, legal issues or whatever else, we will be asked to report on whether or not we did it.\nSpeaker 6: But at the end of the day, you know.\nSpeaker 0: So.\nSpeaker 6: So I like what's written.\nSpeaker 0: Its recommendations will be original within the next four months, will provide recommendations for implementation of this policy. I find this affirmative councilmember desire. We're saying we're going to do it for months. We have to respect that. There's some litigation and it takes some time for staff to put this together.\nSpeaker 0: But no one's saying it's not happening.\nSpeaker 5: Four months instead of six months.\nSpeaker 0: It's there, right there in front of us for months.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. All right.\nSpeaker 0: All right. You want to move approval of that?\nSpeaker 5: I'm not going to move for a wait.\nSpeaker 4: Right.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I want to say.\nSpeaker 4: We may want to say four months from the date of this meeting.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Oh, okay. Rather than within the next four months. Within four months of the date of the letter.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Which is what we're saying in the other things. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So do I have a motion? So moved in a second.\nSpeaker 5: 1/2.\nSpeaker 0: I will. Second. All in favor. I. Okay. That passed. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Last one.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I don't do that often. Okay, last one. Recommendation 19 dash four chest went away. The Alameda City Council, working with the city attorney, city manager and city clerk must develop and implement a code of Conduct and Council Member Handbook.\nSpeaker 0: And this one's pretty straightforward, I think.\nSpeaker 6: Vice Mayor I would just that's pretty recommend option two. I would take what I would call the data edit and change expects to return to will return. Um, and I'm just going to look to city staff to make sure that now that they know what their what they've signed up for whether six months is the realistic policy\nSpeaker 6: and it's.\nSpeaker 0: Within six months from the date of this letter rather than within the next six months. I'm Mr. Levitt.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm relatively comfortable on the implementation development implementation of code of conduct. I'm a little more concerned on the councilmember handbook because that's a possibly a more lengthy document. And so what.\nSpeaker 0: Timeframe would you recommend?\nSpeaker 4: I'd say a year for the second part, but six months for the first part I'd be comfortable with.\nSpeaker 0: How do we feel about that?\nSpeaker 5: Okay. That's the city manager's.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: So moved.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So that can really mean it's not even on the screen yet, guys. Okay, we're getting there. So. So city staff will return to council. Oh. So we're directing or the. Oh yeah. That is. This is staff which you see within the next six, within six months we can get rid of the next within six months of\nSpeaker 0: the date of this letter to provide recommendations on developing a code of conduct. And within one year from the date of this letter to provide recommendations on developing and by the way, the verb is developing in the previous line I developing a council member handbook.\nSpeaker 0: Customer Handbook? Yes. And Madam Clark, if you look at the third line to provide recommendations on, it's developing now. Thank you. Okay. How does that sound? Colleagues.\nSpeaker 2: Great.\nSpeaker 5: Great.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, I wanted to ask.\nSpeaker 5: Is it an option.\nSpeaker 1: To.\nSpeaker 0: If the option to.\nSpeaker 1: A large.\nSpeaker 2: Jennifer.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's the next to the last time.\nSpeaker 5: I would put a I would put a comma after conduct for developing a code of conduct comma and within one year from the date to provide because those are two.\nSpeaker 0: And I've got another little wordsmithing on the first line. Let's make it. These recommendations have not been implemented since we're bifurcating the handbook from the Code of Conduct. So these recommendations.\nSpeaker 6: Well, except its recommendation 9.4.\nSpeaker 0: Uh. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: I just. I think.\nSpeaker 0: It's recommended.\nSpeaker 6: The recommendation has not been done. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Good. Move. Approval. Okay. I have a motion to have a second.\nSpeaker 5: I will second that and let me just offer my closing comments.\nSpeaker 0: Um, let's vote on it first. Your closing comments in the whole thing. Yeah, yeah. Let's vote on this finding, then you put your closing comments. Okay, we have a motion. We have a second. All in favor of recommendation 90 dash for the response to 90.\nSpeaker 0: Dash four. I. Okay. That passed unanimously closing comments.\nSpeaker 6: But can we. Can I make just a motion? I'd like to just approve the letter as written. There's an intro in and out, whatever else.\nSpeaker 0: I just want an opening paragraph in the closing.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. Yeah. Which is as proposed.\nSpeaker 0: Is that okay with you?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. Yes. And I think.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember de SACS, closing comments. Yes. Well, that was a motion.\nSpeaker 6: I'm going to move move approval of the full letter and authorize the mayor to send it on our behalf.\nSpeaker 0: So the full letter as we've revised it tonight. Okay. I have a motion to have a second. And then you can make your comments. And how about we get a motion second? We have a discussion if this is the topic that you want to discuss.\nSpeaker 5: Um. Yeah. I think somewhere along the lines we have to recognize that the people want more information and we have to recognize that the implementations strategies that that we're going to do that that are going to result from it when we were discussing.\nSpeaker 5: I think we have to give a flavor as to what we're talking about. And I think the way that you do that is have a sentence that's in the final paragraph that at least acknowledges the fact that something along the lines of residents of Alameda through throughout this process, residents of Alameda have voiced a desire for not\nSpeaker 5: only transparency in the form of of any information, including electronic recordings being released, but also for for strong remedies, including censure, as well as some form of city recall. I'm not saying that we're going to do censure. I'm not saying that that that we're going to do recall.\nSpeaker 5: All I'm saying is I'm trying to reflect the fact that the people have said that. And so.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Desai I would submit that the people have said a lot of things here tonight and that was said by a few, but not all. And I also think that that language is going beyond the scope of what the presiding judge is asking for.\nSpeaker 0: And I think that we want to be responsive to the findings and recommendations. I think we've done that. And I think there's still time as these matters come back to us to explore how we implement what the people want.\nSpeaker 0: But I think we've done our task.\nSpeaker 6: Oh, that I just I don't think that's an appropriate statement to put in a letter to the judge that this letter to the judge is not a letter to the community. And I, I think, per se, I think you've been very clear that that that is where you see this going and important.\nSpeaker 6: And I think it's incumbent upon each of us to communicate to not just our our entire community, but the community of the message that we'd like them to hear. But I would not feel comfortable, including in a response to the grand jury judgment.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. Statement that is not really written as a part of the response that we are legally required to give. It starts to muddy up what the what this document is.\nSpeaker 0: I think we're very close to completing this task and getting this letter sent off to the. The presiding judge in response to the grand jury's findings. I would hate to have to bring this back in September because we couldn't agree on the first and last paragraph after doing all this work up until now.\nSpeaker 0: So I would ask you, council member decide.\nSpeaker 3: To.\nSpeaker 0: Go with the first and last paragraphs as staff wrote them.\nSpeaker 5: Well, let me just say. You know what people are upset about, as I said from the very outset, is that. There is a that the grand jury report has clearly indicated that some have felt that they are above the law and that that we have a process in place that's not transparent enough to gather information, to demonstrate\nSpeaker 5: the extent to which. Some have been above the law and that's hence the call for four tapes because they want to hear it themselves. But they've also been frustrated. The people have been frustrated by the inadequacy of remedies.\nSpeaker 5: In seven, dash three, seven, Dash three says this is the penalty, but the way in which the penalties implement implement is not clear. And I just wanted to somehow capture that in the letter to the judge, because I think that underscores the the importance and historic nature of this and the way in which residents are concerned.\nSpeaker 0: But and I would submit to you that everything we've done in terms of our agreement with the grand jury's findings and the responses that we have made in response to those findings does everything you said without your specific interpretation.\nSpeaker 0: And the simple fact is you don't have two votes to go with you. So either we move this letter forward now and get it sent off to the grand jury, which I think is sending a powerful message in itself that the city council is ready to address this issue head on.\nSpeaker 0: Or we. Come back after our break in September and are really pressed for time and try to get the closing paragraph written. And I just think that you've had your say, and I think there's other ways to communicate to the people that you're referring to.\nSpeaker 0: But this is a letter to the presiding judge of the Superior Court, and it is time to put closure on this.\nSpeaker 5: I think that the power of this document is in the fact that three council members, a majority of the city council members, have agreed with grand jury findings. And the grand jury findings are. I mean, they were pretty serious stuff and.\nSpeaker 5: And I think, you know, I, I think it is time to move on. People know how I feel on the other issues. And we'll and through the process that we talked about through recommendations 19 at 19.2 or 9.2.\nSpeaker 5: Well, we'll deal with that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Your remarks have been noted. I have a motion to the vice mayors made to send the letter. As we have. I drafted it with our edits. Second, I have a second all in favor. The motion passes unanimously.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, everyone. Okay, so yes, you may.\nSpeaker 6: I know it's not typical, but I just. I feel like we have gone through a lot. I wonder, I, I instead of speaking before we voted, because I know the U.S. Council member decided to wait until after. Would like to just say a couple of you.\nSpeaker 0: May.\nSpeaker 6: Things not quite as prepared as I actually expected it to be. I don't think this was an easy evening for for any any of the folks up here. I think at the end of the day, our city council has said that things did not go the way that they should have gone.\nSpeaker 6: And I it would be hard for me to believe that anybody can kind of look at the acrimony and everything else that has happened over the last year and a half that happened two years ago, actually, and not see the things things went badly.\nSpeaker 6: You know, from my standpoint. I think this council has acknowledged that mistakes were made. And I think we have said that, and we acknowledge that unanimously and actually quite civilly. And I also hear Councilmember de SOG and mayor as the Ashcraft, and I'll say it right now as well.\nSpeaker 6: I think it's also time for our community to move forward and move on. We can't control political conversations around this and whatever else. You know, I, for one, believe that both the investigative report and the grand jury came to the right conclusion.\nSpeaker 6: People made mistakes. It doesn't mean that they should be removed from office. I, for one, am willing to accept this. We don't have a censure process right now, but this is about as close as a council can get to it.\nSpeaker 6: Public bodies all over the the region, the state, the nation have censure processes. People get censured. You move on and you start working together. And I believe that strongly that we can do that tonight. And I'm actually just asking the community to find a way to join us in figuring out how we can move forward.\nSpeaker 6: There is no process for removing people. There is an election in a year. People can certainly, you know, have their say at the ballot box and whatnot, and everybody will. But I think it's now time for our community to move forward and be the best animator we can be.\nSpeaker 6: And I want to thank both my my my colleagues. Those are my statements. You know, I'm sure we all have a slightly different perspective, but I want to thank you. This was a civil and respectful conversation. And I appreciate this because it was not easy.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. My very.\nSpeaker 0: Briefly.\nSpeaker 5: Brief closing comment is simply that I don't believe that the city of Alameda is ready to move on yet. It's only when we look at the recommendations that we come at that come out of our specific charter review committee and council recommendation that come out of 19 dash two on how we are going to strengthen 7-3.\nSpeaker 5: That's the only time when when I think healing can begin. I think right now there is still kind of a scab there that hasn't healed yet.\nSpeaker 0: And I will concur that I think the process takes time. But I think we took a very important first step. And no, it wasn't easy, but when we signed up for this job, we signed up to take responsibility.\nSpeaker 0: And I think we've done that tonight. So thank you very much. If we could bring I'm just getting close to 11:00 and. Okay. Five minute break. Can we do 5 minutes? Okay.\nSpeaker 1: So do you think a vote as soon as you get back to continue continuing to do what you want to do. Well, need to wait for.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Um, you know what? I actually saw that you just. Could we get everyone to take their seats, please? Amelia, can.\nSpeaker 1: You? Yes.\nSpeaker 6: We can vote.\nSpeaker 0: We thank you, everyone. We have to vote because it's almost 11:00. We have to take a vote. And we need for affirmative votes to continue items past 11 so that the four remaining items are item six. C is the the midway developer and exclusive negotiating agreement.\nSpeaker 0: Six Stormwater Fees. Six Zoning for New Fires Facility. 90 is a referral, a council referral and the Commission on Disability. I will just throw in that. I would be okay if we didn't get all the way to the council referral.\nSpeaker 0: I do think that six Sydney are important to be heard tonight. Do I have a motion to.\nSpeaker 1: Go back.\nSpeaker 0: And count? Yes. Councilmember Vella.\nSpeaker 11: Could we consider limiting the amount of speaker time? In light of the late hour on the remaining items.\nSpeaker 0: What do you propose?\nSpeaker 11: I'd like to reduce the speaker time by commit.\nSpeaker 3: Well, if we could reduce it by 2 minutes. That was.\nSpeaker 0: 2 minutes. It. Well, do we have many public speakers. We have four.\nSpeaker 3: We could reduce it to 2 minutes each. I mean.\nSpeaker 11: That's for just for this item or for all of the remaining customs.\nSpeaker 1: Or just for the six C, there's four speakers on 60 and no others.\nSpeaker 11: But we could we could potentially get more speaker slips.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Okay. I, I, I mean, that's okay with me. What do we think?\nSpeaker 9: I'll be okay with that? I'm sorry. That's okay. I'll be okay with that. But can staff kind of be concise too because.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, sure. Yeah.\nSpeaker 9: So there's no some of these issues are like the second or third time, so.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, okay. And Vice Mayor, I'm supportive.\nSpeaker 6: I just want to make sure nobody is here to address the commission and disability issue because I didn't see folks.\nSpeaker 0: Earlier, I did see a.\nSpeaker 1: Lag.\nSpeaker 6: So if anybody was planning on staying here.\nSpeaker 0: Did you leave?

        "source": "Speaker 1: P.m. La Carey to consider Call for review and adoption of resolution upholding the Planning Board resolution to deny a use permit to allow the sale of beer and wine at a convenience store located at 1716 Webster Street.\nSpeaker 2: Madam Mayor, my property is relatively close to this facility, so I'm going to have to recuse myself from this.\nSpeaker 8: Council Member D So I had that done that check and your property. Are you referring to residents? And that is located more than 500 feet more than the outside of the 500 foot radius from the property. So I.\nSpeaker 8: I don't think that's a. I'm looking at the city. Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well. Yeah. I mean it.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Madam Mayor. Members of the Council. So the item before you this evening is a call for a review of the Planning Board's denial of use permit requests to have off sale alcohol. So this is a liquor license to sell alcohol for off premises consumption at a convenience store at 1716 Webster Street.\nSpeaker 8: And because I've done some questions before the meeting about the use permit in the process and for the benefit of the public audience here, what I'd like to do is just spend a quick moment to explain what a use permit is and the considerations that factor into that decision.\nSpeaker 0: I think that'd be great. Thank you. Yeah.\nSpeaker 8: So the city has a zoning ordinance. The zoning ordinance divides the land in the city into different zones, generally based on land use category. So you have residential zones, commercial zones, industrial zones for each zone. The zoning ordinance lists types of businesses and uses that are permitted as of.\nSpeaker 8: Right. And those that are allowable under a use permit. And so the use permit is a discretionary action that provides flexibility in an otherwise very prescriptive set of zoning regulations. Now, because of this discretionary action, the city may choose to approve a permit for one business and deny it for another.\nSpeaker 8: But in order to avoid these decisions being arbitrary and capricious, the decisions have to be supported by findings. And the findings here in Alameda generally relate to the use being compatible with the adjacent land uses, that it is consistent with the policies in the general plan and also that the use will not create any adverse effects on\nSpeaker 8: neighboring properties or persons. It's also important to keep in mind that use permits run with the land. So in making the decision to approve it, you submit a use permit. You want to avoid basing that decision on whether the applicant is a good business person or bad business person, and focus on the objectivity of the and the\nSpeaker 8: merits of the proposal. Now, with this particular request, the history goes back to 1995, when the applicant had requested approval of a use permit for a convenience store to the gas station and 24 hour operation, as well as an off sale liquor license.\nSpeaker 8: The Planning Board in 1995 approved the convenience store and 24 hour operation, but the use permit prohibits the sale of alcohol. In 2012, the applicant, as part of remodeling the facility, had requested use permit to amend that 1995 permit to allow off sale alcohol and staff.\nSpeaker 8: Initially in 2012 recommended approval because we thought that. The sale of beer and wine is is very common in convenience store locations. But after a public hearing, the planning board denied that request due to neighbor concerns of alcohol related nuisances.\nSpeaker 8: The findings made by the Planning Board in the 2012 use permit were all in relation to public health protecting public health, safety and welfare of the immediate neighborhood. That decision was subsequently appealed to the City Council, who had unanimously upheld the Planning Board's denial in 2012.\nSpeaker 0: Excuse me. Member ready to just ask a questions and.\nSpeaker 7: Then a couple of questions. So, yes. Initially, when the first request was made for a variance, planning staff recommended that it be approved, correct? That's correct. And can you kind of elaborate a little bit more on what what the basis of that decision was?\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. So the city's general plan calls for maximizing opportunities for businesses and broadening the types of goods and services available to Alameda residents. And so that under that policy, in that direction, in the Journal plan, staff usually would recommend favorably to businesses that seek to increase the types of services they provide to residents, provided that, there's a\nSpeaker 8: set of conditions that can also control some of the nuisance factors.\nSpeaker 7: And did we have data from the police department to support the complaints of, you know, fights and nuisance and loitering?\nSpeaker 8: And in 2012, there were and in the 2012. And this is just a download from the police database of incidences in the neighborhood vicinity, not, not specifically to the property.\nSpeaker 7: So. So how big is the vicinity then? I mean, you're talking about because there's this picture on our screens up there, too. I mean, is that the vicinity or is it 500 feet?\nSpeaker 8: I don't believe it's based on a specific radius. I believe it's based on police reporting districts. I mean, the police chief is here. I might defer that question to him for specifics, but I believe the report pulled incidents, alcohol related instances, I mean, that covered anywhere along Webster Street between Lincoln all the way up to Atlanta.\nSpeaker 8: I mean, it was a pretty broad area. And that captured 29 incidents in 2012.\nSpeaker 7: And I believe in the 2012 staff report, there was a mention that if there were concerns such as that those that were raised, that those could be handled through restrictions on the liquor license. That is ABC, right?\nSpeaker 8: That is correct.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. So there is a remedy if if if this is approved, there is an additional remedy that, you know, we're not going to allow 24 hour sales it can cut off at midnight. You know, there are certain restrictions that can be placed on on the business, like they have to, you know, hire somebody to pick up litter\nSpeaker 7: and make sure there's no empty bottles and so on and so forth and maybe have additional security or something like that. That's correct. And those.\nSpeaker 8: Were conditions.\nSpeaker 7: Right?\nSpeaker 3: That's correct.\nSpeaker 0: Mm hmm. And will you be describing what the conditions are that the ABC puts on licenses?\nSpeaker 8: These were be conditions that the city would impose.\nSpeaker 0: Right. But the ABC already has some conditions. Right, since the hours. So we'll be discussing that as.\nSpeaker 8: Part of the liquor license. There are some state regulations that the business owner would have to follow.\nSpeaker 7: And the city has an opportunity to weigh in on what some of those restrictions might be based on on some of the.\nSpeaker 8: Cities. The city can impose additional conditions. Right.\nSpeaker 7: But we could also, you know, write a letter to ABC and say, you know, we granted this conditional use permit, but some of the things that we'd like to see are, you know, A, B and C.\nSpeaker 0: So we could add additional for clarification. But there are some things from the ABC, for instance, the hours of sale. So are we still asking clarification questions?\nSpeaker 7: I'm asking work whether we can whether we could weigh in on on ABC and as a city and say.\nSpeaker 0: We can add.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8: I think that's the way the process works is the ABC has its own set of state regulations related to the conduct of business related to alcohol. So just very quickly, they require anyone involved in alcohol sales to take training classes, they have to card check for minors and so forth.\nSpeaker 8: Those are standard regulations. In addition to those regulations, the city may impose conditions such as restricting the hours where the sale of alcohol can take place on the premises, as well as some of the others that you've mentioned.\nSpeaker 7: And if ABC gets complaints from neighbors, you know, they can get this is the correct that they can conduct investigations and even impose even further restrictions if, you know, they're having some problems.\nSpeaker 8: That is correct. But the city's use permit process also allow that to happen within our own discretion.\nSpeaker 7: I have another question, but did you finish the 2012?\nSpeaker 8: I was I just have a couple of key points in the now.\nSpeaker 7: Because I have a question on that.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. So just going through the timeline, in 2013, Safeway gas had applied for a similar request. And based on the 2012 decision, the planning board denied that request. So that essentially said a policy this decision listen in staff's respective that I'll save alcohol on.\nSpeaker 0: Website continues on that point there's a question okay.\nSpeaker 7: But a safe way the store which is a retail outlet on the West End, was given a permission to sell alcohol. Is that correct? That is correct. So how do you jive the fact that the denial was said because there were too many retail outlets selling alcohol in the Webster Street area.\nSpeaker 7: But then if that was the case, why did we give a permit to Safeway, which is a large retail outlet on the West End bordering Webster? Yeah.\nSpeaker 4: So.\nSpeaker 1: Excuse me, Madam Mayor, could we allow our staff, the staff to to finish their presentation and then do clarifying questions? I think he has more things to add and then finish up.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Well, I.\nSpeaker 4: Think it all.\nSpeaker 7: Just at some point.\nSpeaker 4: Perhaps we can all just make note of our questions and ask them when the presentation is done because I'm losing you.\nSpeaker 0: Remember that.\nSpeaker 8: Chair.\nSpeaker 7: Chairs the chair.\nSpeaker 0: So I appreciate that you think you can continue.\nSpeaker 8: Think so. The the request that we have today from the applicant is essentially the same application from 2012. Now staff had recommended denial of this current request to the planning board and the Chamber concurred because the neighbor conditions as we look at it, for which the Planning Board and counsel denied the request in 2012 really hasn't changed\nSpeaker 8: . And yes, staff recognizes that since 2012 there is Alameda landing. There is new competition from safer gas, but changes in the business environment and added business competition doesn't doesn't affect the public health, safety and welfare considerations that really made up the findings of the 2012 city denial and.\nSpeaker 8: And my last point really is that the decision for this particular property, as you can see on the map, there are other gas stations in close proximity and the fact that the findings for use permit relate to the use and its immediate vicinity.\nSpeaker 8: Whatever decision the council makes tonight will likely have implications to those other businesses. And I can attest that I know Shell the Shell Station as well as safely gas, have asked about having a convenience store and selling alcohol from the premises.\nSpeaker 8: So and and I think in the future, if those businesses do come in requesting a liquor license, it would be very difficult for the city to differentiate the findings when the businesses are so close to each other.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you very much for that's your presentation, right? I think there's going to be quite a few questions so you could stay there.\nSpeaker 7: Member Already I'm still because I want to go back to the the findings in 2012 planning board disagreed with the staff recommendation, denied the request, citing the following factors, and one of them was increase in the number of retail outlets that sell alcohol will adversely affect adjacent residents and businesses.\nSpeaker 7: So I mean, I'm not as much trying to find out, you know, ask you about whether or not, you know, competition was a good thing or a bad thing. But, you know, we made a recommendation while I was in here, but the previous council and the previous planning board said there are too many retail outlets that sell\nSpeaker 7: alcohol, but yet we gave a permit to a big box retail outlet, you know, not too far away from there. That's also adjacent to neighborhoods. And, you know, it just seems to me a little inconsistent that we have one set of rules for big box and another set of rules for small businesses.\nSpeaker 7: How do we do that and still jive with that statement?\nSpeaker 0: And before you answer that, I just want to add that the city also gave a beer and liquor license to target right there. Both of them have it.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. So, yeah, there's two. So.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, yes. So now may.\nSpeaker 4: I add some clarification? I was actually.\nSpeaker 7: Questioned. Answer any.\nSpeaker 1: More.\nSpeaker 0: Well, let's go ahead and let him finish the question. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: And try to clarify that point.\nSpeaker 0: Then that staff clarified.\nSpeaker 3: I'm going to I'm going to jump in on that one since I was the planner on that project. We originally approved the Catalyst Master Plan.\nSpeaker 8: So Safeway gas is on what we called a gateway site. Safeway grocery store is on the Alameda Landing Retail Center, two separate sites. The retail center was approved as part of the master plan in 2006. The master plan vested a whole bunch of zoning rights in 2006.\nSpeaker 8: At that time, grocery stores were permitted by right and were vested with the Catullus Master Plan. You could have a grocery store in that site and grocery stores were allowed to sell alcohol. So they had a vested right to do a grocery store that sold alcohol as of 26.\nSpeaker 8: So that's why that got approved. We didn't have the ability to say no alcohol in the Safeway store. Those entitlements and vesting rights did not apply to what we call the Gateway site, which was Safeway gas. And the big distinction there, of course, from in terms of the record and why the city did what it did is\nSpeaker 8: the city was making a distinction between the sale of alcohol with gasoline versus the sale of alcohol from a grocery store. And when Safeway gas came in the city, it was only a year or so.\nSpeaker 3: After.\nSpeaker 8: The council had unanimously denied the sale of alcohol from this site. So. We felt the policy was established. We recommended denial. The Safeway Gas Planning Board upheld that decision. They contemplated appealing, but then decided not to appeal because the council's record of denying these things at gas stations had been fairly longstanding.\nSpeaker 7: I'll ask more later.\nSpeaker 8: I will just add one last thing since that I mean, not because of this, but since this we grocery stores now in Alameda. This doesn't effect on me landing now.\nSpeaker 3: Require a use permit.\nSpeaker 7: So it was target part of that master plan also.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I'd like to follow up on what member he was speaking to. Well, I appreciate that. Apparently sounds like the city didn't have as many options in regards to whether or not there was a change when it came back to the planning board.\nSpeaker 0: It was addressed as though there was no change and. Carl. How do you do? How do you say that when in fact, you now have two large stores offering? It's not just beer and wine. They actually have the license that provides distilled spirits.\nSpeaker 0: And and this liquor. This gas station is asking for beer and wine license.\nSpeaker 3: I if.\nSpeaker 8: I'm going to sort.\nSpeaker 0: Of say, why is that not a change?\nSpeaker 8: What Alan was trying to explain is you're right, there is a change in the environment. There is more competition for this business. We acknowledge that. But competition was not the.\nSpeaker 0: No, no, my question is not really go to competition. I think there's a I think you could argue that there's a change in regards to the availability. True. It's different from.\nSpeaker 3: That's true. But the availability of alcohol and the fact that there's more.\nSpeaker 8: Availability of alcohol because of Safeway gas doesn't change the underlying findings that the council made in 2012 for the reasons why they turned it down. They cited overconcentration. They cited the large number of alcohol related police incidences in that neighborhood as as the primary factors for the denial.\nSpeaker 8: So when we went to the planning board last month and said we don't see a change in conditions, what we were referring to is specifically those conditions. We acknowledge that, you know, Alameda landing has been built since then and Webster Street is transforming.\nSpeaker 8: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. What about regards to these off sale licenses? The report that was provided to us that shows out of the 54 active off site licenses, 16 of them were issued after 2012, which is a 30% increase. City wide of these licenses is offsite.\nSpeaker 0: And and we're having that many more licenses issued citywide. How can this not be looked at as some sort of discrimination against this one retailer? That's a significant increase citywide during that time period. Yes.\nSpeaker 8: I think it depends on the types of businesses or Spirits Alley Alameda Point. I mean those those also would have off sale licenses. There are also businesses that can obtain off sale licenses without requiring a use permit. So good example would be some restaurants that have on sale licenses but also allows you to none.\nSpeaker 0: Of the on sale licenses if I'm going to get to next. This is just off by not allows for.\nSpeaker 8: Like a bottle of wine home with you. So.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So in regards to the answer, I'm glad you brought that up. There's been 41 new issued during the same time period. So we are now at 156, which is a 25% increase across the city of on sale licenses.\nSpeaker 0: How do you not think that it looks like there's some sort of something personal or a discrimination? We know our agencies.\nSpeaker 8: The city doesn't issue those licenses. We have only had. I'm thinking outside my head, Alan There was the Walgreen's proposal on Park Street. There was this gas station. Three years ago, there was Safeway gas. Two and a half years ago.\nSpeaker 0: So they're being issued by someone, though. That's in these reports and they're in our city.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, but it's the. It's A-B-C.\nSpeaker 0: It's all right. Okay. So so when you're looking at whether or not to allow it in the city, you don't take it to you don't consider it a change when there's all these other businesses that are receiving these licenses, whether or not they're being issued by you or ABC, but they're coming to our city.\nSpeaker 0: And and yet for this one person, this one business. You've now you're now actually recommending not to approve it.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. The on sale licenses are really transparent.\nSpeaker 0: The question is not to you if you could hold.\nSpeaker 4: Off and I was just asking for permission to speak whenever you're ready to let me have permission to. All right.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. I was just going to keep going through our questions. Thanks. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 8: So Onsale licenses are generally regarded differently in answer. So what the city does is we when when a new business comes to town, they apply for a business license. They do go through zoning review. And what we look at is the type of business that's in operation.\nSpeaker 8: Restaurants, for example, they typically can serve alcohol and that is recognized under the ABC rules. It's it's it's only usually the off sale licenses that require a conditional use permit. And so I think I think when you're looking at the list of ABC on sale licenses and the increase in the number, it just reflects the types of\nSpeaker 8: other permitted uses that are allowed in the zoning.\nSpeaker 0: It doesn't go into consideration in regards to change, you know, because staff said that there was not a lot of change and.\nSpeaker 8: The. The item before you is a use permit for a specific business on a specific site. We are. We staff can come could completely understand if the council says, you know what, we're we're weighing the pros and cons of potential issues related to the findings that the council made two or three years ago regarding health, safety, welfare\nSpeaker 8: , the police reports and the overconcentration. But we've looked at it in two or three years now, at three years later, and we're thinking we're not as concerned about that. And we'd rather support a small business here in Alameda and make it easier for this business to compete.\nSpeaker 8: And that's a that's a that's a fair balancing of of priorities, small business people, health and safety. And, you know, the day you can make that judgment call and you can if a majority of you feel like you want to rule in favor of the small business that's perfectly within your right.\nSpeaker 8: Our our issue. And what Alan is trying to say is because your findings to approve that are documented and they have to be related to the conditions in the neighborhood, not the businessman himself, the conditions in the neighborhood, the number of police reports, the number of issues.\nSpeaker 8: Our concern is that if you're willing to say yes to the others as well. You're you have no problem. But it's going to be very difficult if you want to say yes tonight and then say no to Safeway gas tomorrow night if they come in or the Shell station when they come in, because the conditions in this\nSpeaker 8: general area are the same for all three. And that's our concern, is that because as as Alan said, we have to be we can't just be arbitrary about this. We have to be very clear why we're saying yes to some people and no to others.\nSpeaker 8: So if the council is comfortable saying yes to more off sales, alcohol sales from gas station convenience stores, that's certainly your prerogative. But it's going to be hard to say no to the others. That's our main point.\nSpeaker 0: So I appreciate that. And then I attended at least one of these planning board meetings on this. And I believe that there were statements made that we in the city do not have beer and wine sales at gas stations.\nSpeaker 0: And could you clarify that? It's my understanding.\nSpeaker 8: So that we do. There are currently three. They're currently located on Park Street. But but we do the there are convenience stores at gas stations here in Alameda that that sell alcohol.\nSpeaker 0: And it's mine. Okay. And so the one on Park Street, Valero, has had it since 2001, which was before this thing came, the first go round one at Chevron since 1993, and the one since the other one on AMPM is 1988.\nSpeaker 0: So so when representations are being made by the planning board that we don't have that, when in fact we've had it in our city since 1988. Isn't that? I think that may be considered a change that needs to be that could be a finding that contradicts the prior findings.\nSpeaker 0: I think that. So. So would that not be a finding that somehow contradicts these prior findings that were made that we didn't have it in our gas stations when in fact, we've had in our gas station since 1988?\nSpeaker 8: We've we've never made the finding in a written document that we don't sell alcohol from. I was at that meeting. I didn't hear anybody say that, that we don't sell alcohol. Maybe what somebody said is we haven't approved any of these since.\nSpeaker 8: 2001. It was probably, you know, 15 years ago was probably the last one. And I think that was legalizing an existing condition. But, you know, as a once again, I mean, you can it's totally within your provocative to look at conditions now in 2015 or 2016 and say, you know what, we just have different priorities and different\nSpeaker 8: , you know, and we wanna make a different decision.\nSpeaker 0: All right. They just have.\nSpeaker 8: To hold it for everybody.\nSpeaker 0: And. Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. And I will just note that notwithstanding what you might have heard and sometimes, you know, perhaps someone misspoke at a planning board meeting. But if you note, exhibit four of this staff report has a list of gas stations and ABC Alcoholic Beverage Control licenses, and there are none in Webster.\nSpeaker 4: And then, you know, there's a whole list of ones that don't have beer and wine sales. But I just wanted to clarify, because I was on the planning board in 2012 when we denied this license and the city council unanimously uphold upheld our denial.\nSpeaker 4: And what we were looking at was that specific location. And so that and this is I feel like I'm getting into the remarks that I've made and we haven't even heard our public speaker. But I just want to clarify, because some some references were made to the 2012 planning board meeting, and I, for one, was there, and\nSpeaker 4: of course Mr. Thomas was too. But we were looking at this particular location. The 76 station applicant came in. He has built a very nice convenience store there, but we denied his application for beer and wine sales at the time.\nSpeaker 4: And the reason was we were hearing from the neighbors, they're concerned with public drunkenness, loitering, littering, crimes being committed. And bear in mind, that intersection know, if if those of you who are familiar with Webster Street can picture the intersection of Webster and Bueno Vista, the 76 station is kitty corner diagonal from a liquor store that's a\nSpeaker 4: full service liquor store just down the block on Buena Vista there. The next parcel down from the liquor store is the 7-Eleven. They also sell alcohol across the street on Webster Street. Going toward the tube is the Chevron station, which has a convenience store.\nSpeaker 4: And you can believe they'll apply. But even more significantly is I'm going to visit next to each of those gas stations, 76 and Chevron. The next properties are housing developments. And in fact, some of them are run by our housing authority.\nSpeaker 4: And I happen to know that they have families living there. They have teenage children. They are always trying to keep those properties in good condition. They don't want the the loitering, the garbage, the the crime that comes with those kinds of sales.\nSpeaker 4: So our concern at the time in my concern still tonight is that if we approve.\nSpeaker 5: One.\nSpeaker 4: Sale, one license for the sale of beer and wine at the time three years ago, I would say you get you approved one, you get three because Chevron and Shell will want them to. Now you approve when you get for.\nSpeaker 0: Ashcroft, this is really.\nSpeaker 4: Appropriate for. Okay. So I'm just trying to say these for our consideration.\nSpeaker 0: You want to see that last time, but if you're arguing this time.\nSpeaker 4: I know I'm not I'm just trying to say you were looking all the way down into Alameda, landing with Target saying we were much more focused on the neighborhood. But you're right, mayor spencer, i will take that of my rex.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you for the reminder.\nSpeaker 0: I swear, no questions. And then we're already.\nSpeaker 7: I guess. I'm sorry. Where did Allen go? So on the just to follow up on the mayor's point, the off sale licenses. I mean, you sent this around to the council. Can you kind of recap the places where we've issued off cell licenses in Alameda since this original application was denied in 2012?\nSpeaker 8: So I would say there are numerous locations I can think of. Spirit's Alley in Alameda Point. There's the Walgreens and the Walgreens here, that Park Street. Um.\nSpeaker 7: And I mean, I said this was unfair market.\nSpeaker 8: 25 unfair market. That's, that's, that's Neptune Neptune Plaza and on Webster Street.\nSpeaker 7: So that's in close proximity to yes. This gas station. That's the neighbor that would.\nSpeaker 8: Be a grocery store with or and the difference between grocery stores and convenience markets would be the variety of products sold and particularly having fresh meat, fish and poultry.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, that that was issued on May 12th, 2015. Was that before or after we changed the rules for grocery stores?\nSpeaker 8: I believe that was before. That was before, yes. 2012.\nSpeaker 7: Now, there's one here that we were giving us at 2015, I guess. The question I have is I mean, is is the point that that area is saturated really a valid finding? If we've if we'd issued liquor licenses in that area since then and not made a similar finding, I guess that's kind of my my question.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. Maybe it's a little rhetorical and it's more of a debate, but.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Did you want to respond to that or you don't? All right. I'm going to move on to our public speakers and thank you very much. All right. And each of these figures, you can have up to 3 minutes sound deep.\nSpeaker 0: David Franklin. Mike. Okay. It's epic. You you i r y a n a DeLong lilt lu.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Mayor and council members Sandip Joel, owner of Houghton Street Hotel on Webster Street. And I also serve as the President of the West Limited Business Association. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I'd just like to clarify one point that Andrew made in the original entitlements for limited lending, we had an you that specifically prohibited grocery\nSpeaker 3: stores. And so I don't think they had entitlement to have grocery stores at all. But, you know, let alone selling liquor. So Safer and Target would not have happened if the ammo you had not subsequently been changed, which we negotiated with cartels to change later on.\nSpeaker 3: But so I don't think they were entitled to have those grocery stores in the beginning and then they started out. So I just wanted to clarify that. I'm here today on behalf of the Board Members to request you to approve this use permit application made by Circle K.\nSpeaker 3: In our board meeting held on November 18, we unanimously voted to support this application for the following reasons. Most gas stations with convenience stores in California now sell beer and wine. And as you know, there are three gas stations on Park Street, namely the Valero, the Chevron and the Arco station that have been selling beer and wine\nSpeaker 3: for several years now. There are already enough places to buy alcohol on Webster Street and on the West End. And if anyone is concerned that allowing Circle K to sell beer and wine is going to bring in additional shoppers to the district, I think they are mistaken.\nSpeaker 3: This circle k location is not a a location. It's it's a neighborhood location. And most of Mr. Lewis customers are residents of Alameda who already know where to buy alcohol. As you know, the 76 gas station was closed a few years ago and the previous owner could not make enough money to continue operating it.\nSpeaker 3: We had some really big concerns when that gas station closed. And luckily and the reason he closed what he did was he did not have enough money to renovate the station and to make the improvements that would have required a substantial investment of time and money.\nSpeaker 3: But luckily, a few months after the gas the gas station closed, Mr. Liu and his brother stepped into that critical time to make changes to the Formula six gas station and build a brand new convenience store by investing over $1,000,000 in that location.\nSpeaker 3: So as you can imagine, the addition of this new convenience store was a very important step in our efforts to prevent blight on Webster Street. With the recent addition of the Pacific Gas Station at Alameda Landing, it has become extremely difficult for local gas stations such as the Circle K to increase their sales through gas sales.\nSpeaker 3: On any given day. I'm sure you all know that if a gas station sells the gas at a much lower price than any other gas station in Alameda. The Circle K convenience store sold a variety of food and beverage items, and allowing them to sell beer and wine will help them increase their sales.\nSpeaker 3: Our goal is to help our member businesses such as Circle K, to succeed in their business so that we can maintain a vibrant business district for the residents of Alameda. And we request you to help us achieve this goal by improving the use permit application tonight.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Mr. Franklin.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilman. I'm the owner of the building right adjacent to this property. And I spoke against it previously. And. Councilmember Ashcroft. Speaks for a lot of what I believe to be my tenants in the building. We're going to Billy's right adjacent to it.\nSpeaker 3: I'm sure we're going to have more loitering around there and with the liquor. I just kind of I don't believe that liquor and driving cars goes together very well. And there are plenty of places they can buy liquor.\nSpeaker 3: But I don't see that we really this the city really needs to make more of it available at this location. All opposed to it by tenants are opposed to it. They asked me to come here and speak to you and tell you that, you know.\nSpeaker 3: They would rather not sell liquor. They knew when they got the permit to build everything, they weren't allowed to sell liquor. And if I'm going to have to come back here every couple of years, I guess I have to do that.\nSpeaker 3: But I don't know. I guess I've said everything I really can't say. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Mike. And then it'll be the long. And then trying Hong Lin in the not too long.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Council Member Thank you for the opportunity.\nSpeaker 2: My name is Mike Carey and I am.\nSpeaker 3: A business consultant.\nSpeaker 8: Working for Circle K Stores.\nSpeaker 3: I am here to thank you and this beautiful city of Alameda. The. Responsible members, community members, the neighborhood businesses and the Business Association allowing Circle K and our licensee to open.\nSpeaker 8: Our one and only Circle K store.\nSpeaker 3: Here in the city of Alameda. We're honored. We are.\nSpeaker 7: There from day one with our licensee.\nSpeaker 3: Mr. Dillon Lou, to support him and train him, providing him the tools to succeed and be a responsible retailer for this community. So just wanted to tell you a little bit about.\nSpeaker 8: Circle K.\nSpeaker 7: What Circle K is all.\nSpeaker 3: About. We are a convenience store company. We, however, were not a typical convenience store company. Our focus is on growing healthy, natural organics.\nSpeaker 8: Gluten free.\nSpeaker 3: Products. That's unheard of in the industry.\nSpeaker 8: So we're promoting these.\nSpeaker 3: Type of products, gourmet food, product sandwiches, Jamba Juice, smoothies in our stores where Mr. De Long Lou has. So it's not a typical convenience store where per say, the lawyers, the troublemakers come and shop for a can of beer, for a bottle of beer.\nSpeaker 3: A beer is a very small portion of their total product mix in our store. However, we feel that it is.\nSpeaker 2: A it.\nSpeaker 3: Gives the business a competitive edge to stay. And compete in the very competitive environment that this particular store is. And we want them to succeed.\nSpeaker 8: The store.\nSpeaker 3: Has. Made progress by leaps and bounds.\nSpeaker 8: However, we feel that there is more that.\nSpeaker 3: They can do to to succeed, be more successful, be more responsible member of this community, a responsible retailer. We have very.\nSpeaker 7: Extensive.\nSpeaker 3: Restricted sales.\nSpeaker 7: Training program that they have in this. Memories think that I would.\nSpeaker 3: Be more than happy to leave with you and review.\nSpeaker 2: That they can train their.\nSpeaker 3: Staff, which is actually more extensive than what ABC requires. There are certain community police departments required. We stand behind them.\nSpeaker 7: We refresh the training.\nSpeaker 3: Program. So I'm here to support. Mr. Lieu and ask for your support to grant. Then his wishes and his application. Any questions? I'd be happy to answer.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: The long loop.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. My name's Dylan Lou. I'm the owner of the 76th store at 1716 Webster Street, Alameda. I'm here today. Tried to appeal to you to give us the user permit for beer and wine license.\nSpeaker 3: We you know, we like three years ago. We are going through a lot of change to build a big store. Big convenience store for the local resident. And I say to a city council member, Maryland and wobble board meeting, we build a store for like 21, 2300 square foot store to, you know, just for the local residents\nSpeaker 3: . We're not a fee free gas station. We're not. We're not. We we we try to help, you know, us and help the local residents to get all their come in and stuff. And that's why we need the spear and wine license to to get, you know, to maximize our, you know, maximize our opportunity for the business.\nSpeaker 3: And one thing I want to say for I have to talk to other harbor board members regarding the city of Maryland, a city council, Maryland. So the concern regarding if you gave to us, you have to give to Chevron, you have to go to Shell.\nSpeaker 3: But Chevron Shell, is there a gas station with all the shop? Chevron is. It's an auto shop. They just closed with a snack shop like us before, before rebuild, before rebuild. We have the snack shop and closed all the store.\nSpeaker 3: And I would say I spent almost $1,000,000 to try to make to the beautify the Webster Street. And if they want a beer and wine license, they should have built another like 1800 square foot a beautiful store and make make a street beautify the street.\nSpeaker 3: You don't have to give them because they want it, because you can put a condition out on their like. And and also for us and last three years just so much change before we build it. We we never know.\nSpeaker 3: I first of all, I never know. Gas safely. Gas station going to be there if safely gas going to be. I won't even build because once I know safer gas stations, it doesn't matter what they do because they're big, but they don't need the money to make money on the gas.\nSpeaker 3: They always ten, 12, $0.15 cheaper on us and they have huge gas stations and they have like dispenser 18 pumps fill stores and they have so everything's brand, you know a lot of like us, you know, they have everything I there's no way I can compete with them.\nSpeaker 3: So I really now but I, I don't regret I spent the money because we build a beautiful, beautiful store. No, I want it now. I need. I need your help. But I even. Look, look, go even look at safely gas station stores.\nSpeaker 3: That's not a convenience store. It's a snack shop. If you close like a snack shop or gas stations as a convenience store. Convenience store, usually 2800 square above they call a convenience store. So they give a lot of different, you know, local stuff to the to the customer safely how many square foot they have.\nSpeaker 3: They probably only have a 1000. It's not a convenience store. This they are just a gas station but section.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you and member already has a few questions for you and I'm going to allow him to ask us questions if it's all right with you because you're the applicant.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 7: So, Mr. Burgess, just quickly, so I'm looking at your your application for use permit, and it didn't really show any hours. I mean, are there some restrictions that that you'd be willing to agree to? Yes. We gave you like I mean, such as shutting off alcohol at midnight or, you know, not doing it until like 2:00 in\nSpeaker 7: the afternoon or something. Yeah. Could you share with some of and perhaps hiring security during the evening hours to make sure there's no lawyers? I mean, can you kind of give us some some ideas and some of the restrictions you may be willing to agree to?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, even even before I get this, my garbage schedule, pick ups, it's almost every day. It's every day we have a schedule. Pick up all the garbage every morning. There's a either garbage truck or recycle truck coming to pick up our garbage.\nSpeaker 3: So I have my cashiers go out on the street every hour, pick up the garbage right now, every morning, every night, every hour we have one cashier. Go out, pick up. If you look at my gas station, if you look at other gas, you can see the difference.\nSpeaker 3: If you go to my gas station, you go to like our restrooms. We are at a state art restroom. We are the cleanest, cleanest restroom ever there. If you go today, right now, even you can see it. And and we're willing to.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, of course. And we don't have to sell beer and wine after a certain time at night. I want to you know, if we can we have that, you know, we can lock the cooler doors. We can, you know, on, you know, automatic log.\nSpeaker 3: And I'll show you tomorrow morning.\nSpeaker 7: We will. It'd be a good time. Like to to midnight to to ten to to 11.\nSpeaker 3: Usually it's a 2 to 2 to I think a 2 to 6 or 2 to 8 in the morning. Yeah. Right. But yeah.\nSpeaker 7: That's don't of what we want to. Oh like that would mean what would be a reasonable restriction for you on when you would be able to sell alcohol at 2 p.m. to midnight, noon to midnight, you know, 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. What type of restrictions would you be agreeable to?\nSpeaker 3: Usually. Usually it's for a convenience store. They usually to sell their one, I think 8:00 to 2:00 in the morning AM to 2 a.m.. That's. That's usually. Well. Well, I, I listen to the console. I, you know, I, I take.\nSpeaker 3: I take.\nSpeaker 7: Would you be willing to hire some kind of man in the evening?\nSpeaker 9: Can I. Can I make a suggestion? We have the applicant is going to be here throughout the hearing. I'd like to hear the other speakers who were behind him.\nSpeaker 3: And then we talk to the.\nSpeaker 9: Applicant back up. That's fine, if that's okay.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: I'm a.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. All right. Don't leave. I'll be calling you back, I think. Jang Hong Lin or. Hello? And then luxury long. And then Katharina Chen.\nSpeaker 3: Hello, everyone. Good evening. Today's I come here just for one purpose. That is. I suppose it's okay to have fair and wide license. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Now set a good example. You don't have to use all the 30 minutes.\nSpeaker 7: Unlike me.\nSpeaker 0: Last too long. Lap Geelong. And then Catharina chan. And then Jessica Zoll.\nSpeaker 3: Like the evening. My name is Lamp, so I'm here today. I just want to support my circle K to get the power license because I think like on our neighborhood line or other time line because I just live.\nSpeaker 3: Along over the course. If they have the allies and then use more U.S. allies, we can go, go, go there to buy something. I think like $1,000,000, they have everything. So, yeah. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Katharina Chien. You got, you all can be lining up. You don't have to wait from the last. So ready to go. Then, Jessica. And Cynthia Bonta. And then Stuart Chen.\nSpeaker 1: So everyone I come here. I just want to support circle K to get the bear license. Oh, thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Jessica. And then Cynthia Bonta. And then Stuart Chen.\nSpeaker 1: Hi. My name is Jessica. And I want to say that unless a cashier has a Coke and a.\nSpeaker 5: Wonderful present for a customer saying that it's okay, should have my license there, too. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Ms.. Ponta.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. They're city council members. I am very appreciative of the care in which you have discussed this issue. I was very concerned that a real thoughtful decision will be made, and I do believe that a fair decision would be to approve the.\nSpeaker 1: Application as it is from your level, you're able to also provide conditions, you know.\nSpeaker 5: As is my understanding. So I think that you can do that. You can approve and.\nSpeaker 1: Provide conditions.\nSpeaker 5: For the applications approval.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Stuart Chen and then Keith Weiser. And then Karen Bass. And then those are the last speakers on this item. If you'd like to speak, please turn in a slip. Mr. Mayor?\nSpeaker 8: Yes. Good evening, Mayor Spencer and members of the council. My name is Stewart Chen, 30 year resident in Alameda.\nSpeaker 3: And a small business owner. I appreciate the.\nSpeaker 8: Council taking time to consider this matter. I'm here speaking in favor of the seven six gas station on Webster Street. This issue at hand. Really it's not just about the beer and wine license. It goes deeper. It's about fairness and equity for all businesses to be fair and to be equitable.\nSpeaker 8: It's about a policy that you guys set. That is fair to all businesses in Alameda. Specifically the West End.\nSpeaker 3: A policy that's fair for the big bucks. And to all the mom.\nSpeaker 8: And pop stores in our.\nSpeaker 3: City, I believe that.\nSpeaker 8: Big boxes like Target Safeway should play by the same rules that all small business owners have.\nSpeaker 3: To do. If the city.\nSpeaker 8: Allows the gas station, gas stations with convenience stores along Park Street, the right to serve, sell beer and wine. Then why are we singling out 76 station on Webster?\nSpeaker 3: The Safeway on the landing currently has 18 gas pumping stations.\nSpeaker 8: 18 more gas pump than any other gas station on the Webster in. If the city granted either through use permit.\nSpeaker 3: Or by.\nSpeaker 8: Other licenses, if we granted Safeway the license to sell gasoline. And at the same time, the license to carry beer, wine and hard liquor. Then again, why are we denying 76 station the same privilege? 76 station had invested $1,000,000.\nSpeaker 8: In Circle K convenient store to help revitalize Webster Street. Instead of commending him, we are penalizing him. This. It's sending a wrong message.\nSpeaker 3: To all.\nSpeaker 8: Future small business owners not to invest in Alameda. I do not see the logic. I'm sorry. Behind us, the city council. Either 2012 or beyond. Usually go along with staff recommendation.\nSpeaker 3: I get it. Because we know that they know what's.\nSpeaker 8: Best for our city. They are too hard to help with expertize in their respective fields.\nSpeaker 3: But once in a while.\nSpeaker 8: Along comes a recommendation that's completely flawed right from the get go. I implore this council to find the.\nSpeaker 3: Courage to do the right thing. That is to allow.\nSpeaker 8: The 76th nation the same.\nSpeaker 3: Privileged that we have given.\nSpeaker 8: Applicants at Chevron at AMPM, Valero.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, guys.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Keith Schweitzer and then Karen Bey.\nSpeaker 3: Madam Mayor, I'm sorry. It's my first time addressing a council like this. Mayor Spencer and council members. I was really my primary purpose for being here is the rent control question later on. So you'll see me again. But I couldn't help but speak up this time.\nSpeaker 4: To raise it so we.\nSpeaker 1: Can debate.\nSpeaker 0: Right?\nSpeaker 4: Well, no, no.\nSpeaker 0: You're fine. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, you probably can hear me.\nSpeaker 0: So go ahead. Go ahead and speak.\nSpeaker 3: So what I want to talk to you about the liquor license is first off. My wife and I, we've lived in Alameda where we're at for 15 years and we live about a block and a half from the gas station in the in the new development and right down one of them.\nSpeaker 3: And we love the neighborhood. We really appreciate the 76 gas station that was built. It is maintained very well as that and said that someone comes up must clean up very, very early because it's very clean. The my concern there will was against the liquor license.\nSpeaker 3: Well, I appreciate the business owners need to survive and need to compete. And the issue that there's a Safeway gas station down the street that opened up and they have many gas station pumps. That's that's about right. Which I respect.\nSpeaker 3: But they put the investment in and there are several gas stations that were already there so that a gas station way down the street was opened up. But they have a gas station right across the street and one a block away.\nSpeaker 3: When he entered into a competitive threat, already lost, it was a business that was bankrupt. So it's very tough to renovate a bankrupt business. So you went into a competitive area. You went in with no liquor license and evaluated the business at the time and made a decision to invest a substantial sum.\nSpeaker 3: It's very true. But you knew the rules and were in there and you made the decision to do it accordingly. But I don't think someone should be permitted to revisit the council's decision and then maybe you guys reject it tonight.\nSpeaker 3: Then he's going to come back in two more years and every two years and and revisit the same thing again. The decision was made. I don't understand why we're revisiting it. And my main point that I'd like to express is the liquor store that's currently diagonal from that from that gas station, this one that at night, when\nSpeaker 3: the sun goes down, there's a collection of people that hang out in that area. And it's my wife and I like to walk around, but we we don't we don't turn left. I mean, we we will avoid that corner because it's just not a comfortable collection of people are hanging out around liquor store.\nSpeaker 3: I don't want to see that happening in 76 station because they don't know what they don't know until they develop it. But if you look right across the street, it's the same neighborhood and they'll see what's going to happen, I hope.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: And here and Karen B and then she's our last speaker on this item. If you'd like to speak on this item, please submit your slip.\nSpeaker 10: Briefing there, Spencer members of the City Council and staff. So I have two comments to make about this. The first thing is, I would love for you to uphold the planning board decision on this as a West ender.\nSpeaker 10: You know, I participated in the West End visioning, and nowhere in the visioning was an oversaturation of liquor licenses. And it's we're turning an important corner on the West End. And there was a time that. When I first moved here, people didn't go on the West and they didn't go to Webster Street, I was told, because it\nSpeaker 10: was, you know, lots of bars and sailors and tattoos, tattoo salons. But we're turning an important corner here. We're going to get a pizza. We've got some wonderful restaurants. And it's just it's it's wonderful to see what's happening on the West End.\nSpeaker 10: And my concern is that, you know, we oversaturate the West and Webster Street with liquor stores. I'm sorry. I just don't want to see anything I don't want to mention is that two weeks ago and midnight, I woke up and I heard this car, heard screaming, and there was a drunk driver.\nSpeaker 10: There's a police report. You can look it up. Okay. It really hit three or four cars at my state, hit my tenant's car. She woke up the next morning. She was crying. I had to take off work to help her.\nSpeaker 10: She was from out of the country. And I had to help her, you know, solve a problem from a drunk driver. And I and I, I just I it's a problem and I don't want to see more liquor license issued.\nSpeaker 10: I'm, you know, I think they made a great case, you know, for small businesses and and big businesses. But it's this is it's more about, you know, preservation of our neighborhoods and a safe neighborhoods. And so that's what I'm fighting for in the West End.\nSpeaker 10: I want quality. I want I don't want a lot of liquor licenses. I don't want a lot of you know, I want more variety. And I want safe places for our children and our our visitors and and our neighbors to go and enjoy.\nSpeaker 10: So I'd like you to consider that other argument tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Nebraska.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor Spencer. I appreciate everyone coming out and speaking in and I want to say to Mr. Geelong Lieu and all the members of the Labor Board, because I did it and they were gracious enough to invite me to attend their last board meeting and I talked to all of them.\nSpeaker 4: And Mr. Lou, you've done a lovely job with the Circle K Station and it's just what we hoped it would be when we approved it. But of course, as you know, we approved it without the beer and wine sale license.\nSpeaker 4: And I did sit down with all of you on the Wabash board, but I didn't stop there. I've talked with neighbors in the area. I've talked with our police chief. I've talked with housing providers. And it's something that the city council has called upon to do just about every time we make a decision and just wait until\nSpeaker 4: we get to the rent matter. We have to balance a lot of competing, competing arguments. And while some compelling issues were raised, I think my friend Karen Bay just did a nice summation for me. I have watched Webster Street over the years, my six years on the planning board and almost three years on the council.\nSpeaker 4: And I made a commitment to the business owners and the residents of the West End that we would not neglect. Webster Street in the West End at City Hall. Webster Street doesn't have the opportunity, the economic catalyst the Street does with the Army, the theater.\nSpeaker 4: So they've had to try harder and work harder. And they're coming along, you know, maybe not as quickly as everyone would like, but they are. But I just feel strongly about what I said earlier, that I am concerned with what that corner will look like, that particular intersection that abuts residential areas.\nSpeaker 4: And that really the planning laws that we are governed by say that if we grant this license for one, the others will want it too. And there's been mention of Safeway and the gas station has a convenience store or a snack shop or whatever.\nSpeaker 4: I also just want to share that when I was on the planning board, the head of real estate development for Safeway came to me because they were coming to the planning board to get permission to put in the Safeway gas station.\nSpeaker 4: And, you know, not everybody wanted a gas station there, but I sat down and listened to him and I said, well, I think I could support it. And then he said, and it's going to be a convenience store and we're going to apply to sell alcohol.\nSpeaker 4: And I said, Oh, you know, hold the phone. Why would you need to sell alcohol when there's a liquor store at South Shore next to the bank, Trader Joe's and Safeway and Walgreen, also liquor. Why would you why would you need to sell it at the Safeway gas station store?\nSpeaker 4: And he said, well, you know, somebody might want to pick up a sandwich and a beer and it's just more convenient. And I said, you know, I'm a former probation officer, and that was really the wrong thing to say to me.\nSpeaker 4: But I really don't like the juxtaposition of drinking and driving. And I wasn't a part of the decision for the Safeway, for the Park Street stores. But what is before us now and what was before my planning board three years ago was what what does what would this look like?\nSpeaker 4: What would this decision look like for the residents of the area? Because the West End isn't just our businesses. We value our businesses. We want to keep them thriving, but it's also our residents. It's also the visitors who come.\nSpeaker 4: And I feel that the planning board three years ago made a good decision. The council then upheld them unanimously. I feel that the planning board last months made a good decision and I'm going to vote to back that decision.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you very much for sharing your thoughts. But we have seen Webster Street transitioning, as Karen Bass said, and I want it to continue to transition in a positive way. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Ben Brody.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Madam Mayor. Actually was one of the two councilmembers. The mayor also being one who pulled this for review. Because I didn't think that the applicant really had a fair, fair hearing. I think has the mayor kind of started to point out in her questioning earlier that conditions have changed?\nSpeaker 7: And I'm not I. I disagree with the contention that. Was given when this was denied that there's going to be a saturation. When we've used that for this particular business, yet we've allowed other off sale liquor licenses in the city, including in the Webster Street area.\nSpeaker 7: So it's a little incongruent to me that we would do that for some and not for others. You know, even if some of them were grocers, which they're entitled to, but others of them apparently are grocers that were rented that license after we we didn't make that a guarantee.\nSpeaker 7: So I think we have a really good business person here. And if he's willing to agree to some conditions, I'd be willing to vote to overturn this decision. You know, for example, you know, perhaps there's no reason to sell alcohol before 2:00 in the afternoon.\nSpeaker 7: I think in consideration of the neighbors, you know, if you stop selling at 11 p.m. or perhaps midnight, I mean, those might be I don't see any reason why you need to sell at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning.\nSpeaker 7: And being that it isn't a residential neighborhood, I hope that the applicant might consider reasonable restrictions like cutting off at 11 or cutting off at 12. I also think that, you know, if you can commit to cleaning up the area and that being a condition like your employees are doing, you know, I'd be prepared to support that\nSpeaker 7: type of condition and perhaps even that, you know, you hire a security guard or another person, you know, in the evening to make sure that people aren't loitering around the circle. K And I will say to the neighbors, you know, the Alcohol Beverage Commission, you know, they do take complaints seriously.\nSpeaker 7: So if you have issues with people loitering at a neighboring station or a neighboring liquor store, you can file a complaint and there'll be hearings and they can get restrictions placed on their license. So if yes, they do.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, I see hand-shaking in the habit. I deal with these that agency, you know, in my day job and deal with people that have liquor license and then have conditions on them. So that can be done. And if you're not getting help, you know, call your state representative and they can help you guide you through that\nSpeaker 7: process. But, you know, I think that this is a really good business person. You know, he has helped with the revitalization of Webster Street, and I don't think that he's a hindrance to it. And I'm not convinced by the argument that the Chevron and the Shell are actually going to apply.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, they don't have convenient stores now, if that is that correct? So I mean, suddenly that they're going to want to turn, you know, their auto shops into convenience stores. I mean, that's going to be a big process.\nSpeaker 7: And they're going to have to do the type of investment that the long did in this store in order to have that. So we would have an opportunity to review that. So I'd like to see, you know, this council grant this application, but with some significant restrictions that take into account the concerns of the neighbors.\nSpeaker 9: Vice Mayor. Thank you. I looked at this. Application very carefully and set my personal opinions aside and looked at what our task is and measured it against what the findings that are required to make in order to to a grant to use permit in this nature.\nSpeaker 9: And I have to say that things have changed on Webster Street and things have also changed on Park Street. The three that are referred to on Park Street are back from the nineties and some cases the eighties. And even that 2001, I was on the planning board when that was approved, but it wasn't approving the use permit\nSpeaker 9: because it already had a liquor license that somebody gave it before, not knowing that there was a requirement for a use permit and had been operating for quite some time and the planning board decided to allow the operation to continue just to legalize it.\nSpeaker 9: So in fact, we have not granted a a convenience store at a liquor at a gas station, a license for since 1995. And that one point that change from from comparison Park Street to Webster Street. We've had a lot of time that has passed in between.\nSpeaker 9: And we had a couple of process public processes for visioning and putting together a Webster Street plan. And one of the findings that we have to make is that the this proposed use relates favorably to the general plan.\nSpeaker 9: And when you read the general plan, it has those two visioning plans embedded in it. And this does this does not seem to align. An application to put a beer and wine sales at a gas station convenience store, particularly in an area where within a block there's there's three, three other convenience stores because there are snack shops\nSpeaker 9: at those other gas stations that it's just not consistent with those plans. So I can't make that finding and the the concerns of the neighbors who are residents right. Abutting the property and abutting the Chevron property, which could be the next one, expressed concern.\nSpeaker 9: And that condition, when you look at the neighborhood, is is another one that I can't I have to support the finding that was made by the planning board the last time around. And then lastly, I think the owner operator of this operation is conscientious, is done a great job in designing a building that's compatible for Webster Street\nSpeaker 9: , but the owner is not being granted the license. The use permit goes with the land. So if Mr. Longo, Mr. Lieu goes away. And sells it to somebody else. We may. We may have someone who's not as conscientious come in because it does travel with the land.\nSpeaker 9: And that's I think that's an that's another deep consideration that we need to make when we get these youth permits out and we can put conditions on it. But the enforcement of conditions. We have a hard time enforcing code violations as it is now to to pile that on top of a use that is is really not\nSpeaker 9: fitting for that area, I think is a problem. And then lastly, the the proximity of of the bonfire down in Neptune corner or the Alameda Landing gas station of that is a problem for people who sell gas. I grant that and I certainly wish we had not put a gas station there.\nSpeaker 9: It's it's appalling when you come in, you know, welcome to Alameda and you have a gas station behind it. That's not. That's that's just not a good looking place. But it's there. And it's it is a fact of life that.\nSpeaker 9: You know, all the gas stations on Webster you'd have to deal with whether they're selling or not. So I plan to uphold the decision, the planning board.\nSpeaker 0: Right. I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: So in regards to bond fair market, does that license stay with that location?\nSpeaker 8: The bonfire has been there for a long time. And we believe the new the new bond fair license was actually a transfer of a license from the prior owner to the new owner. I mean, so when you say there's 40 new licenses, a large number of those are probably just when a business is sold from one property\nSpeaker 8: owner or one business. When a when a business is sold, a new license has to be issued by it.\nSpeaker 0: But does it stay with this?\nSpeaker 8: We don't. But the use permit follows with the.\nSpeaker 0: I appreciate that. But in regards to the impact to the neighborhood, does it stay with that business?\nSpeaker 8: It stays with that land.\nSpeaker 0: So it stays right where.\nSpeaker 8: They use.\nSpeaker 0: That location.\nSpeaker 8: Land. The the ABC license goes with the business.\nSpeaker 0: All right, now, all I can look at is the river. We were provided by these handouts that have says original issue date May 12, 2015. Urban Fair. So that's the information I have to work with, right. But in regards to the impact on the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 0: I. I plan to. Well, there's we've already had, I think, three council members. Right. You know, two. Okay. Well, so I plan to support the the license in that I disagree that these holdings are not arbitrary and capricious.\nSpeaker 0: I think that this would this truly appears to be arbitrary and capricious. And in that, when I look at the licenses that have been. Originally issue date and what is in that neighborhood and what's new, whether including on sale and off sale and city wide as much.\nSpeaker 0: And there has been a lot of conversation about what's happening on Webster and citywide also we have in this city. Quite a few businesses that offer wine and beer and distilled spirits now. And what's interesting to me is the Safeway at the landing is a 24 hour Safeway.\nSpeaker 0: That doesn't mean they're selling alcohol 24 hours a day because they're limited by the ABC in regards to their the hours they can sell. However, they're not limited in regards to any city limitations and they actually can sell distilled spirits, which I think I have a greater issue with than the beer and wine license.\nSpeaker 0: And this vendor is asking for a beer and wine license and throughout our city. So if the city was taking a position that we are putting a freeze on beer and wine licenses across our city. And if the city had taken that position back in 2012, then I and I could understand.\nSpeaker 0: However, since it has and it continues to issue these licenses, I really think it appears to be discrimination against this one business. So I will not I will not be able to support the, I guess, the planning board's decision of not offering this.\nSpeaker 0: And I think that I have I just think a. If if people within our staff and our planning board continue to say this is wrong for this one location, but they are. But it's being offered down the street to a bar that's open until 2 a.m. or another store that's open until 2 a.m. where we round the\nSpeaker 0: clock. I think that's very inconsistent. And I think that that it does not support these findings because overall it cannot be arbitrary and capricious. And I think when if you had a map and you really put the hours of sale and what they're selling in that area and then across our city, it's very, very hard to say\nSpeaker 0: no to this one business person. My opinion. All right. That being said, yes.\nSpeaker 4: The question of staff, maybe the city attorney. So we obviously have an even number of council members here to vote. How does that work? If the vote is two to.\nSpeaker 5: The planning board decision stands.\nSpeaker 4: Because there's not a majority to overturn it.\nSpeaker 9: Vice Mayor I'd like to make a motion then, and I think arbitrary and capricious and discriminatory are pretty strong characterizations of what the planning board did. Because I looked at that, I watched the hearing. I think they have a different opinion, but I don't think it's arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory.\nSpeaker 9: And I also think that there is a difference between all the other licenses and the license that allows you to drive a car up. Pump gas, buy a can of beer and get back in the car right away.\nSpeaker 9: And I think that's a distinction that some people have drawn in discussions with me. So and with that background, I'd like to make a motion that we uphold the decision of the planning board with regard to the use permit at 1716 Webster Street.\nSpeaker 1: And.\nSpeaker 4: In our second. And I also want to echo device mayors comments that I certainly appreciate differences of opinions and community issue an issue from different directions, but our voluntary boards and commissions take their tasks seriously and put a lot of time and effort into the decisions they make.\nSpeaker 4: And I know they do their homework. They go out and do their site visits and talk to many people. Arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory. I don't think so. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And I'd like to add, it's my understanding the vote at the planning board was not unanimous and the word discriminatory did come up from the council member that opposed it. So I'm not bringing that up for the first time.\nSpeaker 0: That being said although some favor I. Oppose. No, no. So the planning.\nSpeaker 5: Or.\nSpeaker 0: Decisions.\nSpeaker 7: The motion.\nSpeaker 0: The motion fails for the motion fails. We have another motion.\nSpeaker 3: I don't think.\nSpeaker 5: If there is no change to the planning board decision by the City Council, then the planning board decision stands.\nSpeaker 4: We're upholding the.\nSpeaker 0: Three. We?\nSpeaker 7: Even though the motion was to. Sustain it, and that motion didn't pass.\nSpeaker 5: There is no action then by the city council.\nSpeaker 7: Even though the motion was to uphold it.\nSpeaker 5: Councilmember. You can make a motion to go the other way and that one is going to fail as well. I can tell you that right now, but go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Maybe that's why.\nSpeaker 7: I'm not making it.\nSpeaker 4: You did the math.\nSpeaker 9: It's like playing tic tac toe.\nSpeaker 0: I'll make a motion. Then I'd like to make a motion that we approve this permit. For the applicant was 1716 Webster. Are second. All right, then that motion fails. Okay. Then you move on to the next agenda item and the planning board decision stands.\nSpeaker 0: And I appreciate everyone that came out on this item. We're going to take a recess.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Can you go ahead and resume if everyone could take their seats? We're going to go ahead and resume. Thank you very much. And now.\nSpeaker 3: Item.\nSpeaker 1: Six C introduction of ordinance, approving a lease and authorizing the city manager to execute documents necessary to implement implement the terms of a five year lease with Dreyfus Capital Partners, a California limited liability company for Building 29, located at 1701 Monarch Street at Alameda Point, the site of requires for affirmative coaching.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 9: terminal, because there is ferry access to San Francisco, so that you're attracting people that are already predisposed to using transit. And so that is a key component of our overall transportation strategy and a key benefit to having that ferry terminal at the Sea Planet, going within walking and biking distance, but primarily walking distance of where the residents\nSpeaker 9: are going to be concentrated, where the jobs will be concentrated. We believe that from an economic development standpoint, maybe these should have been switched in terms of priority for our benefit. I believe they're really one of the major benefits is attracting a commercial users and jobs.\nSpeaker 9: Here is the number one thing that we hear when we talk to potential users is when is the ferry terminal coming and you know, when what year is it going to operate? You know, how far along is all these questions?\nSpeaker 9: And it was the first thing that both the developers that were finalists for our site asked when we want to talk to you about the ferry terminal, we want to provide funding towards the ferry terminal because we see that as a key component of our our project.\nSpeaker 9: And we believe if we're going to replace those jobs and really create an employment center at Alameda Point, the ferry terminal is a key, crucial component to that in attracting those jobs. We also believe, you know, get into the kind of nitty gritty of traffic congestion and obviously minimizing those peak hour vehicle trips.\nSpeaker 9: The general the city's general plan requires that these developments meet certain trip reduction goals. Those goals can only really be met if there is fast and frequent service being provided. Obviously, ferry is not the only thing we're doing.\nSpeaker 9: We're kind of a belt and suspenders approach, but the ferry is a key component of that. An idea is that you have, by having a ferry run in those peak hours, will be minimizing those peak hour trips to the tubes and through the other island crossings.\nSpeaker 9: From Rita's perspective, one might ask, Well, you know, why would we to do this? There's a there's the way that this is set up is not to replace the main street terminal, but essentially to supplement that service, be able to actually coordinate those two services, have seaplane really provide those.\nSpeaker 9: The service focus is more on the peak our main street continue to do peak hour but also have those connections with Oakland and you're able to kind of create a consolidated Western service that expands landside improvements. So parking, which we know is a concern, you're able to add more parking at Alameda Point, which allows them to draw\nSpeaker 9: more riders and you're able to do all of that without undermining Oakland service, because the Oakland service essentially depends on the main street service in Alameda. And if we were to replace it or relocate it, it would be very difficult to sustain that Oakland service.\nSpeaker 9: You're able to maintain the Oakland service, which helps support those midday trips at the same time create a new service that really takes advantage of the development that's planned at the base. As everyone knows, you read the newspaper here about this.\nSpeaker 9: There is a trans bay crisis now with getting people across the bay. BART is essentially at capacity. We believe we're, of course, biased, but because I mean is an island. But we believe ferry's is really one of the the major important solutions to that problem near-term and long term.\nSpeaker 9: And this essentially creates a new corridor, a new Transbay corridor, possibly with connections to Mission Bay in the future, where there's a major employment centers there, all kinds of potential there by creating a new transit corridor that doesn't depend on building a second tube under the bay, you know.\nSpeaker 9: And so we think this is a essentially cost effective way to really increase those transbay trips. And then from an endpoint partners standpoint, we already mentioned this, but this is a key part of their business plan to enhancing value, to support all the infrastructure that they committed to this project, all the perks, and really create enhanced marketability\nSpeaker 9: for all of their land uses the retail, the housing, the commercial. Having that ferry is a key component to their business plan and their development being successful. Where are we planning this? So we have this here. It's this is that you can see this is kind of site a up here.\nSpeaker 9: It's planned down here. And I'll talk a little bit about it's kind of at the terminus of where Pacific Avenue would continue through these buildings and hit the seaplane lagoon. There's a number of reasons that we chose this particular location.\nSpeaker 9: It wasn't just random. We believe number one is what they find, the transportation experts say, is that it's people are more willing to they're willing to walk further from their homes to transit than they are from transit to their jobs.\nSpeaker 9: And so we wanted in order to really create the incentive for the enterprise district in attracting the jobs to locate that ferry terminal, essentially at the heart of the enterprise district, to make it walkable to the jobs. And so and let the people who are living inside walk a little further to the to the ferry terminal, but\nSpeaker 9: really try to maximize the benefit for the job attraction. It minimizes conflicts of other uses. Unfortunately, this picture. And I think if if you're essentially you take this specific avenue that comes through here, you're you're having the ferries come in and then they're essentially come through this breakwater and they just pull right in here.\nSpeaker 9: That allows you to have other uses. We know there's been concerns and questions about making sure that the ferry doesn't interfere with recreational uses. This essentially preserves the majority of these 110 acres, which is the lagoon, about 110 acres for recreational users, and allows the ferry just to kind of sneak in here right to the terminus and\nSpeaker 9: avoid conflicts with other uses. And then this is turns out to be very important from a cost standpoint. But but this location and the design of the ferry terminal has been in place to avoid dredging. And dredging is extremely expensive.\nSpeaker 9: It's gotten more expensive over the last couple of years because of the regulatory policies of how to dispose of sediment that you dredge up. And so this design is essentially because there's very little shoaling or kind of buildup of sediment in the lagoon.\nSpeaker 9: We're able to design a ferry terminal pretty easily to avoid dredging altogether, which is a big benefit to being able to keep our costs down. So what are we proposing? We're proposing a service that's one essentially one dedicated vessel for Seaplane Lagoon, commute oriented, focused in the morning and afternoon evening commutes.\nSpeaker 9: So a minimum of three peak departures in the morning and two reverse peak departures from San Francisco, three departures in the evening. And then to reverse peak departures, no weekend or midday service initially. Really that's with the strength of the main street terminal.\nSpeaker 9: Is are those mid-day and weekend services because of the connection with Oakland that has a lot of regional transit with BART so a lot of Oakland service is actually the weekend midday service. And so we see that really probably staying at Main Street for the foreseeable future and then commencing in 2020 would you know, getting through all\nSpeaker 9: and I'll show you a schedule, getting through all the permitting and finding all the funding that we don't yet have identified, needing that time to do that to be able and keeping that 2020 date. So what are we talking about?\nSpeaker 9: We're talking about waterside improvements that are really more permanent in nature, where you're talking about abutment and pier gangway, boarding float, all adapted to sea level rise about 36 feet above a 100 year flood as part of the permanent improvements.\nSpeaker 9: So those are all the in-water improvements. And then landside we really to keep our cost down and to keep those connections we needed. We needed the city and Bccdc and some of the rail trades and the developer too, to know that there was a safe, accessible connection between site, each phase of site and the ferry terminal.\nSpeaker 9: And so there has to be landside improvements that make it easy to bike, walk, drive and then have a parking lot that is temporary in nature for now. Ultimately, when site gets developed, we really want to minimize the level of improvement here because we do expect this ultimately with site be being developed to get moved farther south\nSpeaker 9: when the new street work network gets put in and all of those improvements get made, the permanent waterfront improvements, which will include very extensive waterfront promenades and things like that. But to minimize the cost of these improvements on the interim, in the interim, but still create those safe and accessible connections between site A and the ferry terminal\nSpeaker 9: . So 400 space parking lot, a transit stop drop off area, very important. We've talked extensively with AC Transit about providing service to the ferry terminal and making sure that they have the ability to turn around here. So all those things that are really going to try to create that intermodal connection and minimize car usage.\nSpeaker 9: So this is a schedule it's hard to see. We have a design going on right now for permitting and then ultimately would have a more detailed design for construction. Permitting is very extensive 18 to 24 month process through all the different regulatory agencies were commencing that.\nSpeaker 9: But this is really the beginning of that and then construction we actually have two windows because there's a very short work window that you each year that you can do work in the water. We put one in 2018 in the event that we everything just goes perfectly and we get all the money and we're able to make\nSpeaker 9: it happen and maybe we construct in 2018. More likely we're constructing in 2019 in order to obtain all the funding that needs to get done and then commencing operations in 2020. Use of funds. So I want to spend it's kind of washed out.\nSpeaker 9: I want to spend a little time in me. I think this is not a cheap endeavor by any means. And that's I don't think you we're looking at for the actual construction cost, about $18.2 million, including the ferry terminal, IN-WATER, improvements in the landside costs and which is probably on a relative level.\nSpeaker 9: It's actually not I mean, that expensive, believe it or not, for ferry terminal, but especially being able to avoid dredging but still a lot of money. And we'll talk about the funding vessel procurement at about $16 million, $60 million.\nSpeaker 9: That's based on a recent acquisition of a ferry, a new ferry. So that's probably a pretty a pretty good number. And then annual operating subs is a minimum of 1.8, could be more depending on a number of factors, but those are the cost of the funds.\nSpeaker 9: Now, let's talk about I guess the most important question was how you're actually how we're actually going to fund this. And the reality is, at this point, we have of those costs, we have about $10 million identified from the developer.\nSpeaker 9: We the has identified funding through Prop one be most likely using probable and B funds for the vessel procurement. All of that hasn't been set in stone yet because Prop one B varies year to year. And so it's not entirely clear that they'll have all that funding, but they think they will and would be procuring the boat\nSpeaker 9: through those Prop one B funding. And then there's annual subsidies that we expect to get through what's an ARM three, which is in regional Measure three? So that's essentially a it's actually sorry, these two are combined a bridge toll measure or a regional gas tax measure.\nSpeaker 9: We do think the region, because of all these transbay issues, is really looking at ways to enhance both bus and ferry service in the interim, because enhancing BART service is a really expensive endeavor that could take many, many years.\nSpeaker 9: And so I think they're starting to look at other transit services and that benefits Alameda because we don't have our we really depend on ferry and busses. So I think that's going to help us. And we do think those those regional measures will occur and that we do think we'll be able to get sufficient operating dollars from\nSpeaker 9: that. Does I can't stand up here today and say that it's guaranteed that we have it all figured out. We don't. But we think it's a real these are realistic projections of 2020 I think we did as to but there's a lot of things that have to fall into place.\nSpeaker 9: And we see this these actions tonight being the first step in moving us closer to that that goal. And with honesty, without a plan and without an M.O., you know, we have very little chance of getting that funding and making this happen.\nSpeaker 9: So we see this as an important step to to tell the region, to tell the federal government. We're actually submitting in the next couple weeks a Tiger grant to try to get the construction dollars for the remaining money for the ferry terminal, but to tell the whole region, the federal government, hey, we have a plan and we've\nSpeaker 9: got you know, we've got a schedule, we've got a budget. We know what we're doing here. We've got an Emmylou with a provider. And so we are a reliable source, you know, eligible and reliable recipient of your funding.\nSpeaker 9: And that's important when there is limited grant funding and these things are very competitive. So having these actions take place before we obtain that funding is important, but also but it is uncertain and it is competitive and we're going to do everything we can to make this happen.\nSpeaker 9: So the wider M.O., you just quickly, that's kind of the plan, the ferry terminal plan, the M.O., you is really just is an agreement between Rita and the city to say, hey, we're going to expand to Sea Plan Lagoon here.\nSpeaker 9: Basically, what we have in the ferry terminal plan, we're going to provide the service. We're going to have this parking. You know, it's very important to we did have those landside improvements. They see parking, you know, and we're going to talk more about that, I'm sure, later tonight and on Thursday night as well.\nSpeaker 9: And but but this is really important for I think for the city, is that we to take an action to say we're prioritizing Sea Plan Lagoon, we have an M.O., you add them, we're going to move that forward.\nSpeaker 9: And I think something that, you know, we do is going to comply with us on our Tiger Grant. And without this memo, you most likely wouldn't be able to do that. So they need to have this assurance of the menu.\nSpeaker 9: And then they we've agreed to support each other's efforts to secure funding. And in response, you know, when we are trying to obtain funding through another source or regional measure, we're going to be there by their side advocating for ferry service to help them.\nSpeaker 9: And so that's part of what this memo does, is create this partnership between the two agencies to to move the Seaplane Lagoon Service forward. Again, this is our recommendation. There's actually I'd just like to say, you know, I'm a new project manager, Michelle Giles, who's with me, who's worked very hard on this.\nSpeaker 9: And so she's here tonight and I want to appreciate her work on this. And then we also have Kevin Connolly with Rita that would like to say a couple of things. And then we also have Joe Ernst with our point partners.\nSpeaker 9: We'd like to take a couple of minutes if you're okay, to just talk a little. At about the importance of this action tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, we do have like six speakers, but one of them is actually Kevin Connolly. So if they're going to speak, if they could keep their comments brief or I could go with the public speakers.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. I'll defer to him, too, to determine that. You want to start?\nSpeaker 8: Oh, and I would just ask that we not limit Mr. Connelly and Mr. Ernst to 3 minutes because they're more than just public speakers. They have skin in this game. So, you know, I consider this part of the presentation.\nSpeaker 4: I'm happy to beat the estimate of 3 minutes anyway. Madam Mayor and council members, I'm happy to be with you tonight. My name is Kevin Connolly and the manager of transit planning at the Water Emergency Transportation Authority. I just want to kind of want to be here to support the proposal by your staff, to really commend the\nSpeaker 4: staff for really working very hard on this and working with us as an agency. And it's a partnership, as Jennifer mentioned. And that partnership is really the necessary factor that leads to projects. We sometimes focus on the fact of projects, do they have funding or not?\nSpeaker 4: The fact is, if there's an active and engaged partnership between a city and a transit agency, they don't ever get funding. So that's really the first step and that's what we see.\nSpeaker 9: DMO us, which is why we really ask it as a.\nSpeaker 4: Requirement. When we do our expansion projects or any project that we're doing, there'll be other ones that we're doing around the bay. But this is one of our one of our first that we've done. We did one recently in Richmond.\nSpeaker 4: But in terms of how are we moving this.\nSpeaker 9: How do we look.\nSpeaker 4: At this project strategically? Our our service, as you know, is booming throughout the bay.\nSpeaker 9: Especially in Alameda.\nSpeaker 4: There are lots of growing pains with that, which we acknowledge. And we are working again as a partnership to work to resolve some of those. But the positive side of those growing pains is that there are a lot of people who are not driving through the tube.\nSpeaker 4: There are a lot of people who are not driving right now. They are taking transit, and that's terrific. We need to find a better way to accommodate that demand. What we see in our near-term future are really by 2019 or 2020 is maximizing our utilization of the main street terminal, not just on the landside where we're obviously\nSpeaker 4: already experiencing parking issues, but really on the water side, we just cannot fit more boats in there to meet that demand by 2020. That's our forecast. So the seaplane lagoon comes in as a very.\nSpeaker 9: Welcome kind of.\nSpeaker 4: Addition here. It can help us address that capacity issue because if we didn't have to do that, we would have to improve Main Street and expand what Main Street is. So that's really where we are strategically. And when Jennifer says it makes sense for the city and I understand all the reasons there and I certainly understand the\nSpeaker 4: economic development aspect, but it also makes sense from a transit perspective in terms of adding more capacity, meeting the demand that's there and really doing a good thing in terms of getting people off the road. So with that, I'll just say thank you for having me here and available for questions later.\nSpeaker 4: If there's if there are.\nSpeaker 1: I swear.\nSpeaker 4: I do have a question and maybe you can expand on this. In all the discussions that we've had to date, where we've talked about contributing money to the the terminal. And in the memo, you there's a sentence here that talks about contributing money or evaluating the feasibility of contributing money to the costs of the vessel.\nSpeaker 4: And can you expand on that a little bit? Are you short of money for vessels? Are you asking, for example, are you asking Richmond to contribute to their vessel? I, I don't know if this is the same, but if you can tell the difference between, say, AC Transit and MIRA, because AC Transit is not asking us to\nSpeaker 4: buy our busses.\nSpeaker 1: You speak to specifically where that is.\nSpeaker 4: This is on under vessels. On page six of the memo you write for sentence if you could. AC Transit is asking you, though, to help pay for the operations of your new service on board of which you are doing so.\nSpeaker 4: They are there is precedent there through the regional measure money that's coming to us know also through your developer contribution. So you've dedicated over developer contributions to AC Transit. They're there. So can you expand? But I mean, yes, I can, because this is the first time it's really shown up on paper that.\nSpeaker 4: Sure. And they didn't just in terms of Richmond Richmond and through the to Contra Costa County is paying for the entire operations for 14 years of that service. So they are a very willing and kind of able a local partner in terms of that clause.\nSpeaker 4: And what that saying is that we do have some future moneys that, as Jennifer mentioned, it's Proposition one B money for a vessel at. She's correct. That is variable and volatile. We don't know how much money we get from year to year.\nSpeaker 4: Sometimes we need a local match requirement. So all's we can do right now in terms of and this is the part of the partnership is we're trying to sort of identify that there's a possibility that we'll have a gap there and we're going to work together to identify the feasibility of what we can do to find a\nSpeaker 4: way to close that gap. And so that's really what that idea any idea how much the gap is? Well, we won't know until it's a the prop Wendy program provides us a funding for that year. We could have no gap.\nSpeaker 4: We don't know until 2018. Thank you, Madam Mayor. That's all I have. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Was there anyone else going to speak before I called Speaker George?\nSpeaker 4: Spencer members of the council. I'm Joe Ernst with Alameda Point Partners. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and certainly appreciate your consideration of this. When we were here last summer pursuing approval of the.\nSpeaker 3: Development plan and.\nSpeaker 4: The DDA, you know, we talked about the importance of.\nSpeaker 3: Value creation.\nSpeaker 4: And that the need, you know, the.\nSpeaker 3: Housing as.\nSpeaker 4: A means to an end, you know, the creation of value for infrastructure, for public parks and and amenities.\nSpeaker 3: And for jobs.\nSpeaker 4: And, you know, equally, the ferry.\nSpeaker 3: Is a very big part of that value.\nSpeaker 4: Proposition here. It will improve the.\nSpeaker 3: Transit.\nSpeaker 4: Solution. It will integrate well.\nSpeaker 3: Better integrate.\nSpeaker 4: Better with the transit.\nSpeaker 3: Structure that we are creating, making it that.\nSpeaker 4: Much more efficient.\nSpeaker 3: And effective.\nSpeaker 4: It'll be at the center of the critical mass. But I think one thing that's very important is since we've had the DDA approval, we've now been able to more actively engage with capital partners. We've been able to.\nSpeaker 3: Engage with companies who want.\nSpeaker 4: To locate to the point, possibly locate to the point. We've been able to engage more with the companies that are there. And without a.\nSpeaker 3: Doubt.\nSpeaker 4: Across the board, the ferry is a very important consideration to making Alameda Point a stronger job center. And so I think Kevin and Jennifer did a great job in laying out several the reasons. But we now have that evidence that since the DDA approval that companies and capital, which are important to achieving our objectives, are looking at\nSpeaker 4: this ferry as a very important component of elevated point. So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. All right. So any other clarifying questions at this time, council? I have clarifying questions on page seven. It speaks to dredging and it says the city will undertake any initial dredging required to ensure adequate depth within Seaplane Lagoon to support Rita operations and that it is of a none is currently expected.\nSpeaker 1: However, I don't think that that's actually the language I need to be focused on. I think the language is the city will undertake any initial dredging. And is that discussed any where else? I'm not sure what initial dredging means as opposed to dredging.\nSpeaker 1: And what could the cost be on that?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah.\nSpeaker 9: We've actually have retained maritime engineers who have evaluated actually actually, first of all, did a what's called the Bathymetric survey, which is basically an underwater survey of the depths very recently. And I think last year we did it of the Sea Lagoon.\nSpeaker 9: So we have very accurate recent data on the depths of the Sea Plain Lagoon. That was the first thing we did. And then we retain marine engineers to essentially evaluate that depth information and the construction design of a ferry terminal.\nSpeaker 9: And they have essentially designed the ferry terminal to avoid dredging. And so we don't expect any initial dredging for this ferry terminal, and we designed it specifically to avoid it because of the potential cost impacts related to that.\nSpeaker 1: But what is initial dredging versus dredging to have it operate? Any dredging required to have it operate or what is it?\nSpeaker 9: There's very, very minimal. And what we because what we did is actually go back and compare that recent BATHYMETRIC survey to surveys that have been done in the past. And what was determined based on that analysis is that there's very little shoreline or in a build up of sediment.\nSpeaker 9: And so we don't expect.\nSpeaker 2: Now, my question is.\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't say just dredging or ongoing dredging. It says any initial dredging. So is initial dredging what it takes to get it operating initially?\nSpeaker 9: Yes, I'm sorry. Actually, it's not even to operate initially. It's to operate it initially, but also to construct the construct the ferry terminal. So sometimes you may have to dredge to can actually construct the ferry terminal or to allow the operation to occur.\nSpeaker 9: The boats, these are big boats to allow them to come in to that to that pier. In what? And so initial means is to get the operating started and to get the construction implemented.\nSpeaker 1: And if the city is wrong on that, that it does require dredging, then it's a the city is committing through this MRU to be solely responsible for that.\nSpeaker 9: We? Yes. I mean, we're essentially responsible for the cost of the ferry. We have agreed to be responsible for the cost of the ferry terminal construction and that initial and that dredging.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And what if in the future it requires dredging, then who's responsible? Because I know we've had we're having that current issue with Mayor Ed right now. Correct. In there. But it requires ongoing dredging. So who is responsible for the ongoing dredging?\nSpeaker 9: So we would be we would essentially work with we that that would be a wider city issue that we'd have to address at that time. But we don't expect there to be ongoing dredging issues because of the essential.\nSpeaker 9: There's essentially no very, very little, very minimal shoaling that occurs in the lagoon and is what the data has shown over time. Unlike where you're talking about the shipping channel, there's significant shoaling. Not only you have significant shoaling, but you also have extremely large building boats that fall very deep into the water.\nSpeaker 9: These are the boats that we're talking for a week are actually much smaller in comparison. And so just don't I think it's called drafting that right. Don't draft is low. And so you just don't have those same issues.\nSpeaker 1: So the menu is silent as to any ongoing dredging. Who's responsible for it?\nSpeaker 9: I think so, yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What about for the parking fees? It does speak to the. These could be charged for the parking. The city will evaluate possible implementation of that. And then it says all proceeds, if any, would be committed back to support.\nSpeaker 1: But who decides the allocation? Would that be up to the city to decide if it's for ferry parking, maintenance operations, or who decides that.\nSpeaker 9: We decide.\nSpeaker 1: City we'd have a decided.\nSpeaker 9: No, we. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 1: So the city decides the city.\nSpeaker 9: Rides how it spends those dollars.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, Dan, thank you very much. I'm going to proceed with calling the speakers at this time and Michael McDonough and then Jerry, 70. And then Kate Quick.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening again, mayor and council and staff. I'm Michael McDonough, president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. As you know by now, the chamber very much supports cite a for more than one reason. But a great big reason is for the infrastructure that it provides in order to not only maintain the businesses we have out there, there's\nSpeaker 4: a lot of infrastructure problems that we need to fix to allow the businesses we already have to stay. But of course, also to attract other businesses to to the point at the time that we have, for instance, site B that we've been talking about, this is really an infrastructure issue.\nSpeaker 4: The it's not just the water main or the electricity or the cell phones. This is transportation. And I know a big part of what we always discuss is traffic and the impact that traffic development will have on our traffic.\nSpeaker 4: This is essential to providing the infrastructure to reduce our traffic. And there are a lot of businesses out there that we don't think about as businesses like, for instance, Argosy University. This is their San Francisco campus located in Alameda.\nSpeaker 4: They get students from all over the Bay Area and this is something they're very excited about in order to increase their enrollment so they can stay in Alameda. We have the College of Alameda out there and we get most of our students from the area.\nSpeaker 4: But what if we could attract other students from outside the area? That would be good for the College of Alameda as well. So there are businesses we don't consider businesses sometimes, but they are businesses because without without people coming to those places, they can't stay in business either.\nSpeaker 4: So I think this is an essential part of really an infrastructure issue to allow for more people to get to Alameda for the the workforce that may come from outside Alameda and not have to go through the two.\nSpeaker 4: So we very much support this new terminal. I think everyone I've talked to is excited about it and I sure hope all of you are and approve this measure tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. Mayor and Council. My name is Jerry Stravinsky. I've been up here before. I'm from the West End. I'm here on behalf of my family, our neighbors and our friends. We're really excited about this. We really want to see the agreement between city and we to go forward.\nSpeaker 4: We feel the operation of the ferry terminal in the sea. Playing the gluon is essential to the development of Alameda Point and to relieve traffic congestion on and off the island. Today and as we move into the future, it will allow visitors and workers from the West Bay to better access the developments at alameda point and the\nSpeaker 4: amenities that we have to offer in addition to giving our new citizens out at the point way to get to the West Bay. The added service will help alleviate some of the crowding that is currently occurring in the Main Street terminal.\nSpeaker 4: As an island, the need to ingress and egress us is limited and very essential as we look to the future. The ability to build more or expand the bridges and the tunnels that we have is very limited and very expensive.\nSpeaker 4: However, the ability to have ferries is limitless. We can have a lot of ferries come in and out of this island, and that will help us grow in a manner that makes sense. It will actually help the people get on and off the island without having to drive a lot.\nSpeaker 4: We have a better chance to integrate the ferries into busses and get the busses to get people all across the island. And that's really important to relieve congestion. It'll work better. You know, we a couple of months or so back, we're talking about a bicycle path know on central how better way to get people going places, you\nSpeaker 4: know, get them out of cars, get them on the bikes, get them to walk, get them on the ferries, get them out of the cars. That's what we want to see. And we really want you to get behind it.\nSpeaker 4: If you're not positive. You're the agreement between Rita and the city to get money out of the federal government in the state won't happen. You have to be positive. The council has to go forward with a very positive attitude about this.\nSpeaker 4: Otherwise, the agreement won't get the funds that we need. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: You quick. Then Richard Banger.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, Mayor Spencer and members of the.\nSpeaker 2: Council and staff. I'm Kate Quick and I'm speaking as a board member of the Alameda Home Team. The Home Team urges your approval of this item as it meets several important criteria to move the objective of creating housing and transportation for all income levels in Alameda.\nSpeaker 2: It'll provide a much needed new source of transportation to and from the west end of the island, which will lessen the traffic impact of new housing and industry in the Alameda Point area on particularly the Webster and Posey tubes during commute hours, which we know is.\nSpeaker 1: A critical mass already. It will allow all the island.\nSpeaker 2: Residents to connect.\nSpeaker 1: Via bus service.\nSpeaker 2: Which the prior speaker just addressed.\nSpeaker 1: To the new.\nSpeaker 2: Transportation hub. And the bus service will also serve.\nSpeaker 1: The new businesses.\nSpeaker 2: And new recreational opportunities at the point. So all of Alameda would benefit by that.\nSpeaker 5: Our current.\nSpeaker 1: Ferry on the north side.\nSpeaker 2: Would stay. So it's now.\nSpeaker 1: Getting so impacted that.\nSpeaker 2: This would add an important other valve to divert some of that building and building and building use of the ferry, which is exciting.\nSpeaker 1: But does put pressure.\nSpeaker 2: On the service and the parking of. The second ferry.\nSpeaker 1: With good bus.\nSpeaker 2: Connection during commute hours.\nSpeaker 1: I think would do a whole lot.\nSpeaker 2: To alleviate some of our current issues and to serve what we have planned.\nSpeaker 1: For that area so that.\nSpeaker 2: Not just those new houses and new businesses will benefit, but the whole island will see benefit by it. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: To Richard Banger and then Ginger Gerry. And then Karen B.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor, and members of the council and city staff. Ferry terminal. Seaplane goon. Sounds like a very good idea. We've talked about it for a long time. But I think it's premature to approve the ammo you tonight.\nSpeaker 4: Here's why. We've talked about it for a very long time. And as far back as 2009, there was a transportation study and yes, it had a seaplane lagoon ferry terminal. It also said that the main street terminal would be closed.\nSpeaker 4: And if you recall, back in 2009, we were talking about a lot more homes in Alameda Point. So now today with fewer homes. 1425. We're going to double the number of ferry terminals. I don't think there are any findings.\nSpeaker 4: That say it's a good use of our transit assets. But you do have a very good vehicle to examine that issue, and that's the recently approved citywide transportation study. You're hiring professionals to do surveys, plug in data, overlay their international experience.\nSpeaker 4: They could they could determine whether it's a good use of funds to have to ferry services on the West End. Now think about these these parking spaces. You've got 400 parking spaces there. Nobody who lives at is going to get up in the morning, go get in their car, drive around the block and park in that parking\nSpeaker 4: lot. So who's going to park there? Well, it could be people that currently use the Main Street terminal. And I don't think we should be considering this as an overflow lot for the main street terminal. If you're just going to siphon off riders from the Main Street terminal, what good have you done?\nSpeaker 4: I think it would make more sense if there was only one terminal, the West on the West End, and that was that at the Seaplane Lagoon. But we have no findings that say that this is a wise use of our funding and there's no emergency that it has to be approved tonight.\nSpeaker 4: You set about to have this citywide transportation study to create efficiencies in the use of our transit assets. If ever there was a transit asset that needed studying, it's this. It's a big one. It's not just coordinating shuttle busses.\nSpeaker 4: It's it's a big investment. And I might point out that that the the determination that this means that the Main Street terminal was going to stay open. It happened kind of in this planning process for the waterfront town center and then site A and then it wasn't until just recently that.\nSpeaker 4: Well, Main Street terminal is going to stay. Well, have we actually studied whether this is going to be a good use, a good use of funds? Well, we haven't. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Ginger. And then Karen Bay.\nSpeaker 2: Mary Spencer, council members and staff. My name is Ginger Tree. I'm a staff member at East Bay and I'm also a member of Bike Walk Alameda. And also my partner Peter lives on center of and we were very excited to bike on a new bike lanes that were approved last month on Central AV.\nSpeaker 2: He incidentally works out of Makani, which is way right next to Seaplane Lagoon and the new here that they took over in general a bike you say we very much support the regional connectivity that the new seaplane terminal would create, as well as helping the Main Street terminal continue providing connections between Jacqueline and Square Oakland and all\nSpeaker 2: the BART access to Alameda. It's a great idea. I have we have some concerns about the local connections for people who want to safely bike and walk to this terminal. And I have three specific recommendations for the council.\nSpeaker 2: Number one is that we have a really good opportunity here to make encourage biking to the terminal. As we've heard from everybody here, congestion is a really big problem and the plan goes.\nSpeaker 9: Takes a really good step.\nSpeaker 2: By creating a two way cycle track with a buffer leading to a terminal. But this continues the leaves bicyclists mixing in traffic potentially. And one way to make people feel really comfortable is by creating a protected bike lane.\nSpeaker 2: You already have dedicated the roadway space for this two way cycle track in the buffer and it's just adding a little bit of concrete can just create this into a protected bike lane. You feel really great. This connection will connect to the Cross Alameda Trail and also the terminus of the central of Complete Street Project.\nSpeaker 2: Making a really great network out there in the West End are two other recommendations would be.\nSpeaker 9: To specify providing secure bike.\nSpeaker 2: Parking at the terminal. There's just on the plan there's just one little word that says bike parking and doesn't say what kind, how many spaces please that secure bike parking like the bike link lockers we have that BART people are going to be coming here from work to go to work in San Francisco, leaving the bike here\nSpeaker 2: all day. Let's keep them safe. And finally, please clearly mark the network your connecting the Bay Trail Cross Alameda Trails, Central Ave Complete Streets help people get where they need to go by providing greater signage. Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: And then Karen Bay. And she's our last speaker on this item. If you want to speak on this item, please turn in your slip.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Members of the city council and staff. Just wanted to also welcome our new city manager. Welcome. So I'm really excited about this item on the agenda tonight. I have written I've been a 15 year, maybe longer commuter on the ferry and I have witnessed firsthand the increase in ridership.\nSpeaker 2: And it's exciting, but it's a little scary. And seeing this item on the agenda, I feel very excited that we're we're positioning ourselves to grow our water transit, which is increasingly more popular not just in the East Bay, but in the San Francisco Bay area since New York just tapped the Hornblower to run the ferry system in\nSpeaker 2: New York. So it's becoming a very popular way to move transit. So I wanted to thank our staff for working so hard. I remember when it was just a hope and then it was a vision, and then it and then it was in our master plan and then we funded it.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Alameda Point Partners, for contributing the $10 million. And thank you, Leader, for approving the strategic plan, because that is definitely what helped us to get to this point today. So I cannot stress the importance of approving this memo tonight.\nSpeaker 2: There are times when, well, we've reached capacity. I can tell you, there are times when people are standing on the ferry. It's it's interesting. I mean, we don't have a lot of people standing, but we have a few people standing and we've got the parking lot so full.\nSpeaker 2: You've witnessed that. I'm sure you've seen it all the way down Main Street. And we haven't even built outside a, you know, all the homes and the businesses. So this is an important project and important plan and important vision.\nSpeaker 2: And I and I encourage you to approve it again as a commuter. 15 plus years. The people love the ferry. They walked through the mud during the rainy seasons. They park their car in the mud and walk in them.\nSpeaker 2: Right. Because they love our ferries. And the more and more people discover it, they think, well, I haven't done this before. So again, thank you, everyone, for all of your hard work. I've been following this when it was just a twinkle in our eye and it's just exciting to see this IMO.\nSpeaker 2: You come before us. We've got a lot more work to do, but I. I feel confident that we have the right people on the job. So thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. She's our last speaker. And I have another question I wanted to ask is part of this. It says that the waterside assets would become Wheaties upon completion, but it actually uses a different term earlier in the paragraph about birthing facilities.\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't see where water site assets. Is that the same as the birthing facilities or whatever water site assets?\nSpeaker 9: I think it's the same. I mean, the water. For. Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Because I would think if it is the same, because birthing facilities is enumerated what that is. However, in regards to when it talks about then than it does say before, all of a sudden it becomes a. I think it's very important that if the SAMU procedure tonight that we specify what in fact the is going to become\nSpeaker 1: we does. And if it is the same as the birthing facilities that are enumerated, then I'd suggest that that be the language.\nSpeaker 8: Could I just ask for a page which.\nSpeaker 1: Is 7 hours ahead.\nSpeaker 8: Of you?\nSpeaker 1: You at page seven? Are you okay? Categories, birthing facilities. And it does define that as very related facilities, extending the word of and including the access control gate. But there's a whole paragraph on that. However, after the pair of about the city being responsible for the dredging, then it says upon completion of construction.\nSpeaker 1: We are and we are operating the ferry service assume control of waterside assets through transfer of ownership with the city and whereby we will be responsible for operating and maintaining these facilities. So at that point, I'm not sure.\nSpeaker 9: Yes, let me clarify, because this was something we actually changed in the language now that I remember to make it clear, because there are some there are both waterside improvements and landside improvements in there within the waterside improvements category.\nSpeaker 9: There are past parts of the pier that will essentially be open to the public, and it's actually really important from the Bay Conservation Development Commission that there's benches that people can use that space when it's not having passengers there, and then there's a control gate and so everything.\nSpeaker 9: And so that's why we changed it to berthing facilities, because there actually are some waterside facilities that will essentially be under our control. We would then allow essentially everything from the control gate westward are considered berthing facilities that are under Rita's control.\nSpeaker 9: And I'm remember because that's that's why we changed we had that as waterside assets but then we all had the same conversation. And so we wanted to and I'm sorry if we didn't clarify sufficiently, but the idea was that the berthing facilities is everything kind of related to actually getting onto the ferry.\nSpeaker 9: Then you'd have public improvements on the eastern side of the control gate. That would be considered part of the city's response, you know, city's ownership and responsibility.\nSpeaker 1: So does Rita end up owning the what is we we do everything.\nSpeaker 9: Everything west of the control game.\nSpeaker 1: And that's currently public property.\nSpeaker 9: I mean, essentially they own the improvements. So it's right now is water and we don't own it yet, but we're hoping to own it next Tuesday. But but once we once the city owns the water, then we would obviously own the water in the submerged property that it was in.\nSpeaker 9: And then once we improved it, we would turn over ownership of the improvements, not the water. We can't obviously give them ownership of that, but any improvements made west of that control gate would be we'd as owner would be underweight US ownership.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Any other questions? Comments.\nSpeaker 8: Member Ashcroft comments. I'm ready to comment. Thank you, Ms.. Ott and Mr. Collin, Mr. Evans, for your comments. I'm very excited about this project. I want to see it move forward. I have some personal experience with the ferry commuter.\nSpeaker 8: My husband rides to San Francisco in and has actually since the night of the Loma Prieta earthquake when the red and White Ferry was pressed into service to bring people back from San Francisco. And I and sometimes I know he runs into Kevin Connolly from Weta, who, if you don't know already is an Alameda resident who does\nSpeaker 8: happen to ride his bike to the ferry. And I asked him, which ferry do you take? And he said all of them in Alameda because he wants to check out the different ferry. But he he bikes to the ferry, whichever one, from his East End home.\nSpeaker 8: We were communicating by email yesterday, and I know that on the 7:45 a.m. Ferry yesterday, that's one of four morning ferries that leave Alameda Main Street to go to San Francisco. There were 230 commuters. That's at about capacity and that number is multiplied times four because all of those boats, the 7:15 a.m., 745, 815 and 850 850\nSpeaker 8: , they fill up. So that's if you do the math, almost a thousand people riding during commute hours. There are two more mid-morning ferries that you see the kids going on field trips through the shoppers or whatever. 925 and 1050.\nSpeaker 8: But you stop and do the math on that. Those are a thousand almost a thousand cars. Well, and with the the later morning ferries, there are a thousand cars that are not getting on the freeway, going over the bridge.\nSpeaker 8: And that's just our Main Street Ferry terminal. We have the Harbor Bay Ferry on the other end of the island. Yes, we do have some growing pains that we're dealing with much the way the mayor of San Leandro, if you heard any of her State of the city address the other day, talked about the good problem in\nSpeaker 8: San Leandro is it's growing. We've got growing pains. We have to deal with them. It's true in Alameda, too. And we are we are addressing those problems, but we also can accommodate even more ferry riders. It's true what Mr. Bangert said, that there was a time when we were looking at more houses at Alameda Point, but now\nSpeaker 8: we are focused more on job creation. And as Mr. Ernst said and I've talked to some of the capital partners too, there is a lot of interest in creating jobs. And the folks who want to work at Alameda Point tend to be the younger generation.\nSpeaker 8: That does things a different way than my generation. And they don't all own cars and they don't want to commute by car and we don't want them to. So they are going to be commuting some from Alameda Point to San Francisco, some from San Francisco and maybe south San Francisco to Alameda point to work.\nSpeaker 8: I think it's not a bad question to consider. Do we need 400 parking spaces? I mean, rarely has it been said that we have too many parking spaces for ferry riders, so maybe we were generous in that estimation.\nSpeaker 8: I leave that to staff in their capable calculations, but we know as elected officials that we have a mandate not just to the citizens of Alameda, but to the region around us to comply with Senate Bill 375, which requires us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020.\nSpeaker 8: And one of the major ways we do that is by reducing the number of vehicles on the road. And the ferry has proved to be an immense, immensely popular, important resource for Alameda. We're so well positioned to take advantage of increasing water transit because of our unique, unique location.\nSpeaker 8: I'm thrilled that Rita and the city are partnering on this MRU and applying for the federal, state and regional grants that can come our way because, as Mr. Connerly said, none of this money comes our way without this showing of united support and that we're ready to avail ourselves of the money.\nSpeaker 8: And as he was talking and Mithat was talking about being ready to accept the funding, I was thinking of when Mr. Madawaska and I co-chaired the Campaign to Build the New Maine Library, the city got all of its ducks in order ahead of time.\nSpeaker 8: We already had the lovely Lynn Oaks Motel property, but we knew that was going to be the site. We had passed our local bond measures, so we knew we had the matching funds. So we were so well positioned to go to the state competition and say, Yep, we've checked up this box, we've checked up this box and\nSpeaker 8: this is what we can do to get more very many our way. And create this this ferry terminal. So I am thrilled to see this project moving along so well and I am fully behind the proposals we're about to vote on.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Remember SA Well, thank you very much. You know, in my office hours that I hold at the farmers market as well as at Blue Danube on Park Street, you know, what I hear time and time again is an incredible thirst on the part of residents.\nSpeaker 3: For real. See it. Feel it. Touch it. Transit solutions that will deal with the whatever. Housing impacts are generated by new development, as well as be an opportunity to bring in workers from outside of the Alameda to work in our work here.\nSpeaker 3: And I think in the $18.2 million project that we're possibly going to kickstart tonight, of which $10 million is coming through an agreement with a developer for site A, we're delivering. We're. Providing for the residents, delivering a real city.\nSpeaker 3: See it, feel it, touch it. Transit solution in this very system. But I don't think we can wait around. I think we need to start moving as soon as possible. I think we've heard testimony not just tonight but previously, that this is an asset, not just in terms of providing service for residents, but an asset in a\nSpeaker 3: false sense of the word that we will leverage to attract the type of economic development that we want, not just a site, A, site B, if we don't move forward with this type of asset and the type of economic development, especially at site B, will be that much limited, dare I say, to load job creating stack container\nSpeaker 3: type of projects. If we want the quality type of economic development project that we want that at, not just site A but site B, then we need to make this investment in an asset like this. I value it for the service it renders for the residents of the future residents and the service that renders or bringing in\nSpeaker 3: workers from San Francisco or other parts of the bay to Alameda. But I think I think a key point of this, though, is that it is something it's a tool that we can leverage to improve our economic development at site B.\nSpeaker 3: One example, for example, would be many years ago when we created the Ron Cowan Parkway as a result of creating the Ron Campbell Parkway, certain businesses that needed to get to the freeway in 5 minutes, the saying is 5 minutes to get to 55 or 5 minutes to get to 65.\nSpeaker 3: Suddenly we can have a types of economic development that that was not possible before. So you had you have people like Peet's Coffee or others coming to the Harbor Bay Business Park because of that investment and the Ron Count Parkway.\nSpeaker 3: In a similar vein. It's an it's this $10 million, $18 million investment that we're making that's going to attract the type of economic development that we need and that we want. So I think that's why it's important. I just want to end by saying, you know, this is the second, in my opinion, homerun that Alameda Partners has\nSpeaker 3: hit in agreeing to the 15 minute shuttle during the peak morning commute hours. Again, that's an example of a see it, feel it, touch it type of transit solution because people can actually see know that that will be a shuttle that goes from site a through parts of Alameda towards downtown Oakland.\nSpeaker 3: There will be a shuttle during the morning commute hours every 15 minutes. So it's this kind of non theoretic, but incredibly real transit solutions that that people are here in Alameda are really thirsting for and that we can demonstrate with with activities like this that we can have a smart, well thought out development.\nSpeaker 3: That's whose impacts, especially whose traffic impacts, are taken into account through these types of of of transit solutions. Now, we should begin to generalize this to other parts of Alameda, like the northern waterfront. And that will be part of the citywide transit strategy that we're implementing.\nSpeaker 3: But I think, you know, in on the final note, the residents should feel confident that, you know, we're making incredible investments in transit solutions so that. So that we can have the type of quality of life that we want and the type of businesses that we want.\nSpeaker 1: And Brody.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Madam Mayor. Just a few brief comments, because I think a lot of the rationale for supporting this has already been stated by my two colleagues that spoke earlier. But just to hone in on what Councilmember De Saag said, this is important for those two reasons that he outlined.\nSpeaker 6: You know, one, it's a transportation solution, not only for Alameda. You know, we're going to have a referral that we're discussing later that talks about the importance of of the ferry system to alleviate congestion and traffic on the island, but also to the greater bay area.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, this is a there are no other cross bay crossings being planned. We're not going to have another bridge. It may not be in my lifetime before we have another transbay tube. So the more we can develop these ferry systems and I hope it someday having reached the South Bay and all these are and San Jose\nSpeaker 6: so we could even have more people off the road on 880 and other corridors besides the Bay Bridge quarter. That would be even better. And also, it's critical to business attraction. We do want the high quality jobs that we're seeing.\nSpeaker 6: Building eight is promising us and the enterprise zone promises us and the site B promises. So this is critical. And I think it's important, you know, that we keep moving forward on this. And the more you as staff said, it's also critical for us to leverage the agreement to get funding.\nSpeaker 6: So these are the things we need to do in order to get funding, similar to the proposal we discussed a few months back about the 200 units for Alameda Point Collaborative. We needed to have that M.O. used so they can go off and leverage funding.\nSpeaker 6: So that's what we're doing today. We're laying the groundwork so we can get this done, and I hope we can do it in your aggressive 2019 timeframe and not the 2020 timeframe. But one comment I didn't hear yet, but I think is important as we go forward is the three suggestions made by the Biking Coalition.\nSpeaker 6: You know, that we find a way for secure biking. You know, that we have clearly marked paths so we know where the network is, you know, and that we have secure and safe bike lanes out there. Because ideally we'd like to have someone be able to go all the way from, you know, South Shore, all the way\nSpeaker 6: out to the ferry station on their bike safely and not have to worry. So I'm fully prepared to support this, excited about it. And I thank my colleagues for their comments.\nSpeaker 1: And vice versa.\nSpeaker 4: I think everybody agrees and I. Listening to all the speakers that keep playing laguna's a lot, the logical place for a ferry service in the ferry terminal. And I brought up the issue because I heard it again, that this is an $18.2 million project.\nSpeaker 4: It's not. It's a $34.2 million project. And I do have concern about the $16 million to procure a vessel because with no vessel, no service services, the way I read this. And I wanted to make sure and perhaps staff can talk a little bit about what our prospects are to close whatever gap might be in the funding\nSpeaker 4: . That to date has not been been addressed. And all of the agreements that we've talked to to this point have always pointed to $10 million for a ferry terminal. And we actually had a safety valve in that, saying that until the ferry service is running site is to provide a shuttle from side A to the existing ferry\nSpeaker 4: service. So I think there's always been some some hesitancy or some. Not hesitancy, but some recognition that it's the actual commitment to run the ferry is is contingent on a lot of things happening. And there are 34.2 million reasons why it may not.\nSpeaker 4: Well, -10 to 24.2, because we have $10 million commitment. And I'd like to hear about what our strategy is going to be to. To gap this. And perhaps. Not to sacrifice some of those things that are necessary and infrastructure that goes into the ground or other transport or better use of transportation dollars.\nSpeaker 4: Then basically buying a boat.\nSpeaker 9: Sure.\nSpeaker 4: I'd be happy for you to play devil's advocate. Where are we? Because, again, everyone agrees that the Ferry Seaplane Lagoon location is the superior terminus. So, yeah.\nSpeaker 9: No, that's good. I'm glad you brought up because I think when I look at this report and I read it and, you know, obviously in the weeds somewhat, but, you know, you think it's the money, how are we going to make this happen?\nSpeaker 9: And in the way that I, I want to just take the way that I start thinking about it. And it's taken me a while. And in dealing with these issues, to think about it this way is there's kind of three buckets, and the first is the terminal construction.\nSpeaker 9: And that costs us the $18.2 million and we have 10 million already. We're going after the Tiger grant, which is very competitive. So we may not get that, but we also are starting to identify county funds that are coming through the measure b b that'll be competitive discretionary fund.\nSpeaker 9: So we start to compete, but we think we're we've done everything to kind of prepare ourselves and put ourselves in the best position to compete for those those county funds will be looking in the future at potential cap and trade, other state funds that we can use.\nSpeaker 9: And so we're looking now at all the different grant funds to kind of close that gap. I will say also that we actually had our master infrastructure plan, I think about $15 million for the ferry terminal. So to the extent that a new development comes in, you know, we may choose or the council at the council's direction\nSpeaker 9: to allocate additional funds from its MIP funds towards this if it wants to. That's another source that could be put on the table for that ferry terminal construction. Then there's the vessel boat and I to very much like you I'm boat I guess bucket but for the vessel is the $16 million I believe that you know, the\nSpeaker 9: way I'm thinking about this is that it is widows responsibility. I mean, that they have identified Prop one B funds. I think that those their funds are going to be sufficient and that we there's going to find capital dollars to do that.\nSpeaker 9: That agreement leaves open the possibility that we may need to be creative with them and look towards evaluating other options. It doesn't commit us to putting any of our development dollars towards that vessel. You're right that those vessel dollars weren't in our map, so we don't have those programed in our costs and things.\nSpeaker 9: So I certainly wouldn't come to you lightly with any recommendation to allocate those funds. And I we've I feel that we have a lot of room here to really evaluate that feasibility. We're not committing to doing it, I think, from Rita's perspective, and we went back and forth in some of this negotiation on both sides, us pushing\nSpeaker 9: them to leave open some flexibility in places. They're pushing us to leave open flexibility because there are so many unknowns and we don't know yet how that trajectory is going to go. And so I think there, which I think is a legitimate response to us, is let's just leave the door open a little bit.\nSpeaker 9: It's ajar, but it's, you know, you have a lot the city has its interests protected and that we're not committing to providing those funds, but we're leaving the door open to exploring that with them. We're not committing to doing it.\nSpeaker 9: And so, you know, given that there was a lot of push and pull on a number of issues where we wanted flexibility in other areas, I felt comfortable recommending that tonight. And then on the last bucket is operating subsidies and there really are that is going we believe and we've heard a lot of rumblings of a regional\nSpeaker 9: measure three or a regional gas tax. We know that MTC and the legislature and other folks are talking about this. This transit crisis is bringing that to a head, we believe, because of that transit crisis and because of the intractability, really, in terms of creating a second to for BART that they're going to be looking for other\nSpeaker 9: modes. And we do think ferries and our indication is that ferries are going to be a big part of that. And there's a lot of pressure for we to for Rita to really grow and be more visionary and expand.\nSpeaker 9: And I think the region and the state are coming to think that. So we do think eventually there's going to be and so that's that last bucket is the operating dollars that are going to come through some sort of regional toll measure or a regional gas tax measure.\nSpeaker 9: And that's how, you know, that's how we started to see it. Now, are there ifs and buts and unknowns in each of those buckets? There are. You know, I think there's a realistic path for each of them, and I think we're going to get there.\nSpeaker 9: But it's certainly not guaranteed and there's some uncertainty and we need some flexibility to respond to that.\nSpeaker 8: If I could just.\nSpeaker 5: Look.\nSpeaker 1: The price.\nSpeaker 4: Of your company.\nSpeaker 9: So that's my response.\nSpeaker 4: Hopefully, I think I think you laid out the risks. The big risk is not in the master infrastructure plan. It wasn't programed. In that being said, I think as long as whatever action we take tonight. Records and identifies that we believe that the acquisition of the boat is.\nSpeaker 4: A weight of responsibility, first and foremost. I think that's that helps mitigate that risk. Also, this this project, $34 million is not too much more than the theater cineplex parking garage. True. And that was a risk. You have to be forward thinking so.\nSpeaker 4: I. I feel we have to look forward and maybe take a risk.\nSpeaker 1: Remember Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 8: So I just wanted to respond in part to the vice mayor, respectfully, that it hasn't been a decision made by this body that the council would have that the city would have known that we would bear full responsibility for the bird acquisition.\nSpeaker 8: I appreciate you raising that point. I also don't want to see us tie our hands. I'm I'm gratified to be reminded of the $15 million in the master infrastructure plan for the ferry terminal. I think there are unknowns at this point.\nSpeaker 8: I mean, there have to be because we don't know all the funding sources, whether we'll get them, how much will get. And we I mean, if the funding gap was a narrow one and it just took a little bit of money, would we really want to paint ourselves into a corner by saying the boat acquisition is entirely\nSpeaker 8: the responsibility of we do. So I would just like to say that that's a concern that should be addressed. The cost of boat acquisition. But I'm I think without a full or robust discussion of that point by the council, we can't say it was a decision.\nSpeaker 1: All right, so I'd like to discuss this item. We had a speaker, Richard Banger speak in regards to is this a good use of transit assets? Shouldn't we wait that it's premature to approve this tonight? In lieu of that, we haven't had the heard back from the transportation study.\nSpeaker 1: Is my summary and staff. Could you address that? Why can't. Why can't we wait and hear back on our transportation study? And also, what is the fate of the Main Street terminal? That was also my recollection brought up in his comments.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, I think I mean, I think one of I, I remember and, you know, have a discussion. I remember when we were talking about the citywide transit plan and team plan, some of the concerns that the council had were holding things up because we were waiting for 18 months study to come in and and determine these things\nSpeaker 9: . And I think so our our feeling is this has been in the works for a long time. We we believe our plans have been discussing this for many, many, many years. And that's there's we have been studying it with we know what has been studying it.\nSpeaker 9: We've presented those those that determination and those and that analysis and the benefits here. You know, we don't think it makes sense to wait for the study another 18 months, and we don't think we can hold up all transit and transportation solutions for 18 months until that plan is done.\nSpeaker 9: Because we think there's a lot going on now with transit for good reason because of all the issues are experiencing. And I think our staff's recommendation would be to be nimble and continue moving forward on things, especially things have been planned for a long time.\nSpeaker 9: I'd also say that, you know, one of the real benefits of this terminal and hopefully getting it done by 2020 is being able to attract those residents that want to locate near ferry terminal. And this is worse. This is just this has taken a lot of effort to get to this point.\nSpeaker 9: But the effort has just begun. The permitting takes 18 to 24 months. We're going to be going to hearings before DC. There's a lot of risks there about Bccdc. What are they going to require us to do? And I think the longer we delay that, I think there's concern that we miss those work windows, that we could\nSpeaker 9: potentially not be ready to take advantage of the service in time to really create and attract the residents that want transit. And I think that's always been our key component of our transportation strategy, is to have the 15 minute headways of shuttle from day one, try to have a ferry terminal made up by day one, but day\nSpeaker 9: 365 or something. So that we're really attracting residents that want are depending on that service to be there that don't have cars or only have one car because they already know that service is there. And so I would just caution against us putting too much off into the future, especially in something that we've been studying for so\nSpeaker 9: long already.\nSpeaker 1: And I want to look at this isn't this is an MRU, it's a legal document where we are actually agreeing what we are going to do, what's the city responsible for? And and I really want to hone in on that part at this point.\nSpeaker 1: So one thing it does say on page two of this MRU is that after evaluating the Alternatives Expansion service to see Plan Lagoon while maintaining the existing Main Street service was identified as mutually beneficial. But does this and will you commit Rita to maintaining the Main Street ferry?\nSpeaker 9: There. There made it very clear in this memo you that they are not going to forego or replace that with this new service. And, in fact, their strategic plan that they're reviewing now that we commented on has policies, in fact, that are very clear that we cannot abandon our existing assets.\nSpeaker 9: They need to be part and part of the city's comments, staff comments to the their board was to say that exact thing. So they have no interest in.\nSpeaker 1: But is it does it speak to that in the same way you.\nSpeaker 2: They say.\nSpeaker 1: That you.\nSpeaker 9: Can look at it. I mean what it. My understanding we can is that it's very clear that they are not going to this is not a replacement of their existing service and they are going to continue their main street service.\nSpeaker 1: So I think, unfortunately, we actually have some ongoing, I'm going to say, disagreements going on with we do in other parts of our city, for instance, the Harbor Bay parking, the main street parking. And I and this is a legal document and I really think it's important that if in fact, that that is the intent is that\nSpeaker 1: in here because that I mean, that's.\nSpeaker 9: And I guess just let's be really clear what it what do you want it to clearly say that this is not a replacement of the Main Street terminal, that they I mean. I'm just trying to get at what would what would you like to.\nSpeaker 1: See the plan. The intent is to. Well, and so but the language that's on page two that I'm not sure is actually. And part of the US part, actually we were agreeing to it. It does say that after evaluating expansion, after evaluating the expansion service to sea, playing lagoon while maintaining it says maintaining the existing Main Street\nSpeaker 1: service was identified as a mutually beneficial approach. But of course, I can see. So it's on the bottom of page two under the strategy.\nSpeaker 8: Center of that. But.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. After evaluation. Right. So it says was identified as a mutually beneficial approach to accommodate ongoing demand for ferry service in West Alameda. However, I don't see a sentence that specifically says that we will is agreeing to maintain the existing Main Street service.\nSpeaker 9: I think later in that paragraph.\nSpeaker 1: Maybe that's here somewhere. Yes. Okay. Good.\nSpeaker 9: Because, you know, I don't have it all memorized, but I do see at the end of that same pair, the city. And we'd agree that at a minimum, the existing levels of service and current amenities, including both the quantity of on street and street parking facilities, will be maintained at the Main Street Ferry terminal, irrespective of future\nSpeaker 9: sea playing, lagoon ferry service being implemented. So there was this very.\nSpeaker 8: Fact that.\nSpeaker 9: They have a very successful service at Main Street, don't want to do anything to jeopardize.\nSpeaker 2: That.\nSpeaker 8: We're not.\nSpeaker 1: So it's my understanding that currently the parking at the Main Street terminal, the city is looking to add in additional parking. So does this mean that we just at all we're not discussing that at this point, is we are going to not go ahead and interrupt?\nSpeaker 9: No, I mean, not as part of this memo or this action tonight that's not being talked about. And we do we are working on those access issues. I think some of them are at Harbor Bay are going to come up later tonight.\nSpeaker 9: But I will say that that is something in fact, we did add as an expanded part of the scope for our citywide transit plan is how to address some of these transit connections to the ferry terminals and parking issues related to those.\nSpeaker 9: And so we expect, in fact, to come back in July as part of some of the near-term deliverables on that transit plan, talking about how we can start to take some near-term solutions to addressing the ferry parking issues.\nSpeaker 9: But that's not what the action is tonight.\nSpeaker 1: And in regards to the vessels that was on page six that the vice mayor brought up. The city is not committing to have to contribute any money to purchasing the vessel.\nSpeaker 9: Now we are committing to evaluate the feasibility of potentially using some of our sources of fund cities funds towards the vessel. That's all. We're not committing to allocating those. Certainly that action cannot be taken without the council's direction to do something like that.\nSpeaker 9: But we are committing to evaluating the feasibility of doing that.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And in regards to the dredging. I am concerned that the city is agreeing to the initial dredging without any limit and what that cost could be to the city. I would prefer that there be some dollar amount to that.\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately, we know when we've done projects we can be wrong. And in fact, we've had projects come back just recently where once they started, I believe it was the EOC, the EOC where we ended up needing additional moneys.\nSpeaker 1: So in the event that we're wrong, I would prefer that there be some dollar limit on what the city is on the hook for.\nSpeaker 8: I would say that that would be really premature without knowing more about what the what the costs are. I mean, we also have a study and the reason that you engaged a reputable, experienced firm to do that study and the reason we're citing the seaplane lagoon in this particular location is to avoid the the need for the\nSpeaker 8: dredging.\nSpeaker 1: And I appreciate that. But let me speak to this. When the EOC came back and needed additional funds. Member Ashcraft, you voted against allocating the additional funds for it.\nSpeaker 8: Now, that was.\nSpeaker 1: My.\nSpeaker 8: Questioning of the need for the EOC, not the fired, not the physician. But that's not but we're talking about.\nSpeaker 1: But to me, it is related because there are sometimes anticipated, unanticipated, as much as we're saying right now, there could not be. You know, it's it's unlikely. It does put the city on the hook for, in fact, all of the costs of that dredging.\nSpeaker 3: Madumere, if I may. On the matter of dredging, or anyone who's been a longtime resident of the city of Alameda, we well remember in 1983, when Captain Kelly ran the enterprise against the onto a onto a sandbar. And so for anyone and it happened in May and May Time magazine and and, you know, for anyone who remembers\nSpeaker 3: that, you know, we're always concerned about about shoals or sandbars or the need for dredging. My sense is that that is a serious conversation that can happen independent of the M.O. you tonight and probably would be better treated in its fullness outside of of of this.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm.\nSpeaker 1: I just.\nSpeaker 3: I hear I hear I hear you.\nSpeaker 1: I think it specifically says that the city is responsible for the dredging initially up until getting the the ferry operating. And then there is another point where in the same way you were dredging is discussed and it's on the bottom of page eight where it says in regards to capital rehabilitation there, it says the city, and we\nSpeaker 1: shall coordinate efforts to secure funding and permits to undertake future maintenance dredging as required. So it is spoken to there that the parties would work together for that, and I actually prefer language like that. Also in regards to any initial dredging that we would be working together, that it would not be solely on the city.\nSpeaker 3: My take my take on this is that this is a memorandum of understanding that outlines some of the responsibilities and expectations of each of the parties involved, but not to a t such that it's an, you know, a detailed, lengthy contract.\nSpeaker 3: It sets the framework for that detailed contract that would happen at some point in time. So if that's the case, then the discussion as to how to deal with dredging issues, I think still still stands. If if in the memo you if the memo states that the city of Alameda will be responsible for dredging, then then we\nSpeaker 3: will be responsible for judging. And to me that that's a natural predicate to that, is that well, then that implies that at some point in time we will have to have a serious analysis. And that serious analysis, again, is independent of of of looks there.\nSpeaker 9: I can I just want to. Yes. And one thing is, is that as I was saying, those three buckets, we have kind of assumed responsibility for that first bucket, which is the construction of the ferry terminal. And when we talk about initial dredging, that is usually lumped in with that construction of the ferry terminal because it is\nSpeaker 9: considered you know, that's part of the initial cost is to to dredge to put the terminal in to get operations started. And that we have kind of said, hey, we know you're doing, you know, we're going to work together on these operating dollars and the vessel hopefully from Prop one, be the cities through its developer and grants\nSpeaker 9: . We're going to work together to try to get grants for that difference. And so we see that as being that part of that initial bucket. And I'll just say, I mean, if we're wrong, if our Marine engineers are wrong and there are dredging costs that will increase this budget, you know, we will not be starting construction on\nSpeaker 9: this until we have you know, until we have the money to do it. And so if it turns out that there's not sufficient funds because there's dredging costs, we don't think that's the case. That's not what our experts are telling us.\nSpeaker 9: We're not going to start construction and then find out we don't have enough money. The dredging is the first thing you have to do to get this started. And so we would know that as part of a very before we even start construction.\nSpeaker 1: So I appreciate that. So then what does that mean? That because the language is clear, it says the city will undertake the initial dredging required to ensure adequate depth. So to me that reads as so the city is responsible.\nSpeaker 9: I'm agreeing with you. We just we all of our studies and analysis have demonstrated that, in fact, the entire design of this terminal has been predicated on avoiding dredging.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what I'm trying to find out is, okay, if you look at that language and it comes back that it costs, I'm going to say $4 million for dredging. I'm just going to say a number I'm going to ask our attorney, does would we be able to or whomever hold the city responsible for the costs of\nSpeaker 1: the dredging at that point? It's on the bottom of page seven. Or is it something else? I see that. But I think what I just.\nSpeaker 2: Heard me say is that the city's obligation to actually do the construction is contingent on us securing the money. And I guess I'm not sure where that is in this document. I don't know if you know or if you know where that that kind of thing.\nSpeaker 2: But the answer would be no, because we do not have an obligation to move forward unless we have secured the money. And that's not in this section.\nSpeaker 1: Assuming, whereas I don't want to assume it's here, I actually want a legal opinion on where is that in here? Then you do not have to proceed if it turns out to be more. I'm sorry, I don't want you to interrupt me right now.\nSpeaker 1: I actually want to continue because the attorney just raised a point and what.\nSpeaker 8: She was reading over. I just want to point out that when we're talking about funding, this is a competitive process and we are going to be competing with other communities up and down the bay who also want ferry service.\nSpeaker 8: So that's the reason we're entering into a cooperative agreement.\nSpeaker 1: So this is this okay, this is a memorandum of understanding. This is not necessarily quality management.\nSpeaker 0: I mean, I also want to just point out that the grants that we're going after assume a cost. And if that costs is increased because of the dredging, then we will increase our requests and efforts to get additional funds.\nSpeaker 0: It doesn't say we have to use general fund dollars or city dollars. It means we will take the lead on dredging. But the other thing is the reason that we want this to be approved tonight is because we're trying to submit a Tiger grant for $18 million.\nSpeaker 0: So. So we have. That's why it's on the agenda tonight. So we can meet this deadline for the Tiger grant.\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that. But this is a legal document. I think our attorney just raised a really valid point.\nSpeaker 2: You did my opinion.\nSpeaker 1: It'd be nice, right? That language should be in there.\nSpeaker 4: Man. Mayor?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, vice mayor.\nSpeaker 4: I think in. In this case, there's. Oh, we haven't. Are we going to get an answer soon or should we recess or.\nSpeaker 1: Well, every week. Recess.\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. We're going to recess. That's a great idea. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Is this language.\nSpeaker 1: Council, did you?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. So basically the answer is this is not like a construction contract where there is a performance and, you know, a set amount with performance date for performance and the ability to sue and be sued if people fail to perform.\nSpeaker 2: This instead is a memorandum of understanding and as the document states it at the very beginning, it establishes the framework for development of this new ferry terminal. And the hope is that it's going to be implemented as early as fiscal year 2020, but it doesn't establish any specific date when anything has to occur.\nSpeaker 2: And so in the question about if the city wouldn't have the funds all available as this I'd explain to build the terminal, we would not start building the terminal. And on page eight of the document, under the caption service expansion at Main Street terminal by 2021, the document says that by 2022, if I can't even talk, I'm\nSpeaker 2: sorry. If by 2021 the seaplane lagoon terminal has not been constructed. But regional operating funding is available for additional service to Alameda. So in other words, the city doesn't have the funding available, but we do apparently have some additional funding we may elect to make any necessary major capital improvements to accommodate additional vessels and service expansion at\nSpeaker 2: the Main Street terminal and reconfirm the validity of this memo at that time. So what this is saying is that's basically their remedy. If we aren't ready by 2021, that they can look to either utilize funds to improve the main street terminal and then basically renegotiate with the city to determine whether or not we have the adequate\nSpeaker 2: funding. But there's nothing in here that would force that would allow we to to force the city to build something we don't have the funding for.\nSpeaker 1: And then there is the comment raised in regard to secured bike parking that's not included in here. Does staff anticipate having funds for something like that or is that something we could work out with Leda? And I've heard about that other sites too.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. So there is a place for bike parking and this has to go through a public design review process where we would then evaluate all of that and have to determine exactly the number of spaces this is meant to be that kind of overall plan that the Council's providing direction.\nSpeaker 9: Then we would go and put together a design review application that would go through that planning board process, and that's where we would get into the details of the streets. I mean, there is a protected bikeways, I'm not entirely sure all along side and then connecting down ferry point we show a buffered bike way.\nSpeaker 9: But but if if there'd be a public process through the planning process, if that bikeway we wanted that street to be configured differently, that could be done as part of the design review process.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So in regards to any financial risk to the city. What risk do you think there is?\nSpeaker 9: I mean, until we you know, at this point, we don't think there is a rest of the city right now. All the permitting and other fees are being paid for by the developer that's contemplated in this, um, in our development agreement with them.\nSpeaker 9: And we don't spend money until we have, we can demonstrate that there's sufficient funding to move forward with it. So very little risk. I mean, our staff time, obviously, but very little risk.\nSpeaker 1: Any other questions or comments?\nSpeaker 4: McNamara I think I think we heard a good explanation from the city attorney about the position of this document and what we have to do. I've been satisfied with I think the biggest risk is that is that our infrastructure plan did not include the vessel.\nSpeaker 4: That being said, I've heard that Twitter has is got avenues of access to get that money. And that's a risk that I'm willing to take at this point. So I'd like to make a motion that we approve the Seaplane Lagoon Ferry Terminal Plan.\nSpeaker 4: We approve the M.O. you and we adopt the addendum to allow me to point.\nSpeaker 1: Out any questions, comments at this point. All those in favor I oppose. The motion carries unanimously. Thank you. At 1030, we need a motion to consider the remaining items. Six E budget. Nine A referral and we need four affirmative votes to do that.\nSpeaker 4: I moved.\nSpeaker 3: So do we have another vote at 11:00?\nSpeaker 2: That's an item after 1030, I guess right now it's not 1030 yet. So you could take six and then you vote again at 11, but you could not take up nine.\nSpeaker 8: But it's 1029. But then we vote again whether to go past 11, right?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. But not to take a new item.\nSpeaker 8: No. Right. But we we would stop at 11 if we didn't get the affirmative votes for that. Yeah. Oh ho.\nSpeaker 2: Ho. Quick.\nSpeaker 0: Quick solution. Amending the fiscal year. Can I.\nSpeaker 2: Presentation?\nSpeaker 1: Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I had asked about a motion to consider remaining items. I didn't hear. I heard a motion. I didn't hear a second. Okay. If it doesn't need to start. No, no, I haven't called the item.\nSpeaker 1: I actually received this request. I have not called. The item is not appropriate. And I honestly please take a seat at this time. I've already. I received this note from the clerk. Okay. We had a motion. We didn't have a second.\nSpeaker 1: We don't have a second. We're not going to be able to. All right. So it's going to die a natural death, in which case at this point, I'm going to move forward. You didn't have a second?\nSpeaker 8: I think it was three cameras.\nSpeaker 1: I think there.\nSpeaker 8: Was a question about whether we would take another voted 11.\nSpeaker 1: And so so it's not really disjointed. We do this all the time. At 1030, she gives me the note and I and there's a motion made. There's not a second it dies. A natural death, in which case we continue to the items that we can go to without the motion.\nSpeaker 1: Which takes us.\nSpeaker 2: To.\nSpeaker 1: Oral communications and on agenda. I believe we could hear no. 60 and 90 were part of the motion. Okay.\nSpeaker 8: I think we need to revisit the motion because.\nSpeaker 1: I know someone wanted to. He made a motion.\nSpeaker 8: We have a motion.\nSpeaker 1: And the motion was to consider the remaining item six and nine. And it and I read the same slip.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. And if your request for affirmative. 11. I understood what you said the first three times Mayor. So I and my caveat was simply this is one vote to take additional items at 1030, but we will vote again at 11 whether to go past 11.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. So under those circumstances, I will second the vice mayors motion.\nSpeaker 1: All right. All those in favor I, i others oppose. No, I oppose a motion. Carry 3 to 2. I know it requires four affirmative votes, so it fails, but it does feel all right. So that's correct. In which case the motion fails.\nSpeaker 1: And now we continue with if I and you could help me out of the.\nSpeaker 0: City manager communications. It's not required vote so you can continue with that section.\nSpeaker 1: City Manager Communications.\nSpeaker 8: Was there anything time sensitive about the budget?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yes.\nSpeaker 8: I wish staff had spoken up.\nSpeaker 1: So we've had a motion and a vote at this point it's not.\nSpeaker 0: So is.\nSpeaker 1: There an.\nSpeaker 0: Option legally if one of the two votes chooses to reconsider that motion so we can get the budget approved tonight?\nSpeaker 1: So, Councilor, do you want to weigh in on this? We just had in motion we can.\nSpeaker 2: Do a reconsideration if one of the two opposing votes wants to make a motion. All right, guys. No.\nSpeaker 8: So we have to be.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Correct. You remember Audie and myself.\nSpeaker 6: To stop.\nSpeaker 1: And I and I'm not going to agree either at this point. If we've had a motion, we've had a vote, if neither of the people that voted against it want to proceed, then we continue with we honor the vote and we're ready.\nSpeaker 1: So in which case, now it's appropriate for a city manager communications.\nSpeaker 0: So the communication is. I just. There's no report. I mean, it sounds like we want to get through tonight. And what I wanted to do was to recognize AMP for getting recognized as the number one safest utility and it competing against 250 other utilities.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Introduction of ordinance amending the Civil Code by amending various provisions of Article eight Sunshine Ordinance of Chapter two Administration, including provisions related to public access to public meetings and public records and Sunshine Ordinance enforcement, including recommendations to eliminate the null and void in order to cure remedies and replace such remedies with the authority for the Open Government\nSpeaker 1: Commission to issue recommendations to care and correct.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And we have a okay. And so we have Assistant City Attorney John Lay to do the staff report. Good evening.\nSpeaker 6: Madam Mayor. Members of the council, members of the public. John Lee, on behalf of the city of Alameda, Alameda City Attorney's Office. I'll keep my remarks brief.\nSpeaker 0: And just be sure that you speak right into the microphone so everybody who's out, you're seeing.\nSpeaker 6: Things. So our office was charged with preparing amendments to the Sunshine Ordinance, and we did that in consultation with the city manager's office. And we worked very closely with the city clerk's office, in part because they have a great deal of institutional memory and knowledge in this area, and we thank them for their assistance on that.\nSpeaker 6: I'd also like to acknowledge the Open Government Commission when we prepared the amendments which ended it for their discussion and recommendation, and they provided us with very thoughtful and thorough analysis. And I just want to state that we respect the work that they do, and we want to I want to thank them for the input that they\nSpeaker 6: provided and the ordinance currently that you have before you. Proposes ten amendments. The first thing I want to do is sort of emphasize that. In nine out of the ten amendments, our office and city staff and the Open Government Commission were able to find common ground.\nSpeaker 6: Nine out of the ten we were in agreement. There were probably two minor amendments to those nine, and our office agreed with those amendments as recommended by the Open Government Commission, and those amendments are reflected in the staff report.\nSpeaker 6: That is, of course, leaves one amendment that there wasn't such agreement, which is sort of the elephant in the room I'm referring to, obviously the null and void remedy. You might recall that our office did prepare an opinion on this remedy, and I'm not here to reiterate or rehash any of that.\nSpeaker 6: I will just simply say that we continue to hold that opinion and we have been keeping an open mind in terms of new facts or law. And that hasn't changed. But I'm I do want to emphasize that if the council does wish to make the amendments as proposed by our office and staff, what sort of remains, even\nSpeaker 6: if it were removed and the agency would still have many of the matters they currently have within their purview, they'd still be able to review council actions and all boards and commissions subordinate to the council. They would still be able to impose fines for violations of both portions of the ordinance, public meetings, public records.\nSpeaker 6: And they would also, based on our recommendation, be able to make recommendations concerning the complaints that they hear so they could make a recommendation, for example, to care and correct. That would still be within their purview, even if the council chooses to take out an old board remedy.\nSpeaker 6: So I'd like to close with this idea that the the amendments here before you are actually the result of great civic engagement, you know, fierce advocacy on the part of the agency for greater transparency through thoughtful legal analysis, not just from our office, but also members of the public.\nSpeaker 6: And with that, we recommend that you adopt excuse me, introduce the ordinance up first reading based on staff's recommendation. If you have any questions, I'm here to answer them.\nSpeaker 0: So, counsel, before we hear from our public speakers. Does anyone have any clarifying questions about the report?\nSpeaker 9: Councilmember Vela Yes, I'll go ahead and start ahead of Councilman Brody so that he doesn't have to lead on every might. My question is, who recommended that this provision, this null and void provision, be added to the ordinance?\nSpeaker 9: How how did it come about?\nSpeaker 6: I will say that I tried my best to research the issue on my own, and I wasn't able to determine. I know there have been allegations that it was actually prepared by a member of the city attorney's office, none of whom are currently here.\nSpeaker 6: I don't know the definitive answer. To tell you the truth.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. And then.\nSpeaker 6: And.\nSpeaker 9: Similarly, are there any other cities that have a similar commission or body that that has this type of power? So our cities.\nSpeaker 6: Understood. And so when we started this process and we did do some research on other cities that have sunshine ordinances. Actually, the First Amendment coalition keeps a great list of all the cities. As you can imagine, it's a topic of their utmost concern.\nSpeaker 6: And we identified 14 jurisdictions that we surveyed and none that we were aware of, and that was probably six months ago, roughly had this null and void remedy and sort of in a bunch of caution. And to make sure that we are thorough, we actually serve those jurisdictions again to see if any changes were made and none\nSpeaker 6: that I'm aware of.\nSpeaker 9: Did you review the meeting, the meeting minutes from when this ordinance was enacted as part of your research?\nSpeaker 6: I did I did review the meeting minutes. My recollection was that they were quite sparse. Maybe they were more action minutes. I do recall reviewing the tape as well.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Then, Mr. Abbott. Councilman Brody? Yeah, well, let's go. I mean, it just makes up the order a little bit. Councilmember Desai, you go next.\nSpeaker 6: Is a quick question. Was the concept of null and void, was that in the original ordinance that resulted in the creation of the of the AGC? And so at least so if so, then we know a time at which point it was adopted.\nSpeaker 6: So I obviously wasn't here when that was adopted. My recollection was that the Sunshine Ordinance was adopted around the same time. That is that the sort of organic statute that created or memorialized the duties and powers of the Open Government Commission, they were around the same time as my understanding it's in a different chapter of the AMC\nSpeaker 6: , but it was around the same time. Okay. Quick question. And it's more of a broad question, and I don't know if now's a good time to answer it, but I'll ask it nonetheless. What harm is there if we keep the concept of null and void in the ordinance?\nSpeaker 6: What kind of harm results from that? Sure. And it's hard to tell with a crystal ball. I mean, obviously you've got our opinion out there. And so it's a null and void remedy is used again. There is this sort of incongruence about where our office stands and obviously our office is opinion may or may not change, but\nSpeaker 6: there there's that risk. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And I would just ask Mr. Lay for those in the audience in watching who might not have reviewed the staff report. In your opinion, can you just encapsulate a little bit about the the precedent that this would set and.\nSpeaker 6: Sure. You know, one thing that I've remarked time and again about this remedy is that although it's been in there since its inception, I think it's been used only recently. And are you asking sort of for the for the legal position I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: I shouldn't make this a guessing game. I highlighted in the staff report on page six of of of your staff report about the middle of the page, a little below that the well, you describe how the city council's authority to legislate locally stems from its constitutionally granted charter charter city powers.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. And you quote some legal authorities noting the limitation on the power to delegate legislative authority and then talk about the null and void that I'm.\nSpeaker 6: Happy to bring.\nSpeaker 0: I want to take it from there.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, I think there are really to I mean, if you look at this from sort of a lost perspective, I mean, the general.\nSpeaker 0: Wants one.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, yeah. The general rule is the one that we're citing. And there have been refinements to that general rule. But the general rule essentially states that when you have a policymaking body that's vested with it, with the power, with various powers, and in this case the legislative power to make local law, they cannot delegate that authority.\nSpeaker 6: And what is meant by that is that and the purpose behind that is to is to ensure that the policymaking body makes the fundamental policy decisions. Now, there has been some refinements on this general rule over time, including Supreme Court precedent.\nSpeaker 6: Ah, Supreme Court, California Supreme Court that talks about when you can do delegation. But we view that authority as separate from sort of the general rule. So the question really for us is, is does the null and void remedy, where does it fall within the law, within the jurisprudence?\nSpeaker 6: Is that more of the general rule or is it the refinement? And the refinement is one that you're all very familiar with. You've done it multiple times where you make the overarching decision, the fundamental policy decision, and you leave on to some executive or employee to decide how to fill in the blanks, because it's fully recognized by\nSpeaker 6: the courts that the Council can't make every single policy decision possible to ensure that every eventuality is provided for. Instead, what's recognized is the Council may make sort of a fundamental and you did this with the rent ordinance, you did this with cannabis, and you've done it with various other ordinances where you create this regulatory regime, you\nSpeaker 6: decide that that's what you want to do and you let staff. Fill in the blanks. And for us, we don't believe the null and void remedy falls within that second bucket where you're just filling in the blanks. That's not what's occurring here, at least in our view.\nSpeaker 6: For us, it's more of a fundamental policy decision, in part because the power to make local law includes the power to repeal it. And for us, we feel it falls more into that box. I hope that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And kills over disagree. You finish with your clarifying questions. You can go. No, no, stay with you and then we'll go to accountability.\nSpeaker 6: On this subject matter. Some have pointed to Article three, Dash two, as language that allows policymaking boards to establish concepts like the null and void. And they're the way that I receive emails about, you know, referencing 3-2 is when people write the council.\nSpeaker 6: May three, Dash two says the council may confer upon any board or office powers and duties. Now, is it correct, though, that there is a part of 3-2 that oftentimes is left out? And that part is the predicate because a full reading of 3-2 is the council may confer upon any board or office powers and duties, and\nSpeaker 6: the missing predicate seems to be additional to those set forth in the charter so that we can. What that means is the council can confer upon boards and policymaking bodies, powers and duties, but it has to be consistent with certain parts of the city charter.\nSpeaker 6: So if the city charter says that ultimate power making authority rests with the city council, which it does in section three, dash one. Mm hmm. Yeah, I agree. I think that's certainly one possible interpretation of it. Sort of the meaning of additional and whether it means additional to those powers, to those boards and commissions that are actually\nSpeaker 6: , you know, set forth into the charter. That's certainly probably the easiest interpretation to take, that it's additional to those. So if not so stated, it's not clear that it's provided for. I think that's sort of the gist of your point.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, Councilman Brody, thank you.\nSpeaker 3: My questions are on other sections, so hopefully you can answer them. So going to the. I think it's. Section one, Part D policy body shall mean the following blah blah, blah. Okay. I'm looking at the the draft ordinance, but I think that's what it is.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. So I mean, there's the housing authority board fall under that purview.\nSpeaker 6: Under the definition of a policy body, right. I don't believe so, because I it's not clear to me that they make policy on. Well, they certainly I know that there they observed the the Brown act and so their their meetings are agenda I's a need a lot of the sort of parallel requirements that we have in our\nSpeaker 6: sunshine ordinance. Now now if you're asking if they are sort of fall within the purview of the Sunshine Ordinance, you know, I have not thought about that.\nSpeaker 3: Can you? I could look this up, but could you remind me what? Five, four, 952. Is that what.\nSpeaker 6: That that that's the portion of the Brown Act that actually defines what a legislative.\nSpeaker 3: Body. So that's the Brown acts. Somehow their subject has a policy body under the Brown Act. So we're defining a policy a policy body as it's defined under the Brown Act. So it would think I would think that they would also be subject to our Sunshine Ordinance as well.\nSpeaker 6: Understood. I you know, as I sit here, as I stand here in front of the dias, I mean, I that sounds like a sensible interpretation. I guess what I'm saying is that I don't know that we've actually sort of connected those dots.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I want to hear from the city attorney, Ben san, please.\nSpeaker 5: So, Councilmember, I believe that because the housing authority is currently a separate legal entity, much like the school district, they're not subject to the Sunshine Ordinance.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Maybe we could suggest that they adopted voluntarily. So my second question, maybe I'll go back to the way my colleague was describing it. So two Dash 91, dash five.\nSpeaker 6: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 3: So the audience requires all documents material to an agenda item accompany the agenda. So, I mean, we just had an instance today. I know there's a lot of work that needs to be done to put these presentations together, but I mean, should that presentation, which I mean, arguably was material to an agenda item, I mean, should that\nSpeaker 3: have been something that was part of the agenda or. Or is that an exemption? And if it's an exemption, then maybe this is not something we want to put in there.\nSpeaker 6: Which presentation. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 3: On the traffic.\nSpeaker 6: B Oh, I wasn't here for the traffic spillage. I'd say sometimes.\nSpeaker 3: We have presentations that accompany agenda items should be put on the agenda and sometimes we get them at the last minute. So I'm just wondering where that type of presentation would fall under to Dash 91.5?\nSpeaker 6: I'm not sure, but I can I can tell you that sort of the intent of the of the amendment was to really just take the language and ensure that it's not just sort of general materiality, in other words, just general relevance to relevance to the entire topic and more about, you know, what the agenda, what the action\nSpeaker 6: that's being taken. So we were trying to kind of narrow that a bit so that it was a lot more clear. And I'm I'm not sure that I've answered you, but.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, who is to decide if it's materials at the object's job.\nSpeaker 6: I suppose it would be if there was a violation or or alleged violation.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, to me, it's just it's unclear. Sure. If it's unclear, then it opens up room for interpretation and controversy. So.\nSpeaker 6: Sure and.\nSpeaker 3: Little concerned.\nSpeaker 6: About that. I understood. And I would just.\nSpeaker 0: So I will just remind people we're asking clarifying questions about the staff report. Council will have ample time after we've heard our public speakers to do a discussion.\nSpeaker 6: Now, make not just one note just really quickly and I don't want to leave the impression that the logic will simply be sort of grasping in the dark to figure out what this means. The object is staffed by our office, so they would have the ability to consult our office in terms of determining whether or not there\nSpeaker 6: was a violation or what was considered material in light of these changes.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And then my last question was, so you have to dash 91 that 1515, which there was a discussion about that vis a vis resolution 15382 which prohibits ceding of time. And then we have to dash 93.7, which says this provision states that all local laws inconsistent with the ordinance are superseded.\nSpeaker 3: So I mean, is that 15382 kind of in conflict with two dash 93.7.\nSpeaker 6: I'm sorry, where's the conflict in the two sections?\nSpeaker 3: Well, the the Sunshine Ordinance allows you to cede time right and point a spokesperson and 15382 got rid of that option and that's but yet the Sunshine Ordinance says it takes precedence over anything else. So I just wonder if there might have been an issue there.\nSpeaker 6: Sure. But I'm not aware of it conflicting anywhere else. And to the extent that it does, we can certainly address that in a subsequent amendment. But we did want to clarify that. We wanted it to be consistent with council adopted resolution.\nSpeaker 0: Right.\nSpeaker 6: We primarily made the to the extent permitted by law to clarify.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Lane, I'm going to interrupt you just so your boss can speak. Mister said.\nSpeaker 5: So. Council Member I think your point is well taken that the the sunshine ordinance does. You're right the sunshine ordinance allows speakers to see time 15382 does not. And given that one of the reasons we're bringing this forward to you is is our thinking that because you when you adopt it 15302 later, that that is the policy\nSpeaker 5: the council wants to effectuate. And therefore, we're proposing the amendment to make the Sunshine Ordinance consistent with the Council's will on that particular issue. If if that is not the Council's will, we're happy to additional changes.\nSpeaker 3: Well, that was clairement. So then the final question. Sorry. So then does it are we applying that to the 93.7 prospectively or retrospectively?\nSpeaker 6: Only it would have to be prospectively, I believe. I mean, unless we have a provision that states that it's going to be retrospective, there's a general rule against retrospective.\nSpeaker 3: But it sounds like.\nSpeaker 6: Retroactivity.\nSpeaker 3: Skews it sounds like we did kind of make it retroactive. That said, if we do if. There's something written before then. This supersedes it. But going forward. Well, you can think about that. We can talk about it when it's time to discuss.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Any further clarifying questions of counsel before we go to our public speakers? Let's go to our public speakers.\nSpeaker 1: And we now have eight speakers. So.\nSpeaker 0: So when we have eight speakers, the individual speaking time goes down to 2 minutes. But rest assured, 2 minutes is a pretty good, long period of time. So to keep things moving along, my goal is always to get us out on the same evening that we started the meeting.\nSpeaker 0: I will. And again, no cheering boos doing the wave, what have you. I'm just listened respectfully to speakers, but listen for your name. If you're the next speaker, put yourself out in a position to be next to the podium.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I'm Adam Clark.\nSpeaker 1: We have Susan Hauser, Steve Larson, then Bill Smith.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. Good evening, Honorable Mayor Ashcraft, Vice Mayor Knox White and council members. The League of Women Voters of Alameda was a strong advocate for the development of the Open Government Commission or the Commission and participated in its development through the Sunshine Task Force in 2010.\nSpeaker 8: You are now being asked to reconsider your decision and remove the main enforcement mechanism from the Commission. We request that you oppose doing so. The Commission stated that the enforcement role is essential to our democracy and the main purpose for the Commission's existence.\nSpeaker 8: The City Attorney states that the City Council cannot delegate or grant legislative authority to the Commission, implying that the enforcement provision is legislative. It is not legislative. This enforcement authority did not abdicate any of the City Council's legislative power.\nSpeaker 8: The Commission simply evaluates and rules on process issues, not the merits of the Council's legislative action. In summary, the enforcement provision is not legislative. We recommend that after a complaint about improper process is filed, you suspend further action until the Commission has had time to investigate before holding the next and certainly the final hearing on the legislation\nSpeaker 8: . The Open Government Commission is more likely to be viewed by the public as a neutral arbiter of council adherence to legislative procedures than the Council itself. The Commission has also proven to be a more accessible arbiter than a court system that requires expensive attorneys.\nSpeaker 8: We urge the City Council to reject the proposed amendments to the penalty section of the Sunshine Ordinance. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Steve Larson. Then Bill Smith, then Kurt Peterson.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening, Mayor Ashcraft, council members. I'm Steve Swanson and I'm here to speak in opposition to the proposed ordinance and to demand it be tabled. I want you all to understand that it's not that we don't trust you.\nSpeaker 11: It's just that we don't trust you. You haven't done any favors for the people of Alameda in the last two or three years with this million dollar payout to the former city manager helping yourself to $40,000, borrow money to pay your personal attorney's fees, holding a special election costing the people of Alameda $700,000 for the sole benefit\nSpeaker 11: of one developer and failing to bill that developer for the $700,000 additional cost. And lastly, you're not doing the people of Alameda any favors by trying to tamper with Measure A. The sunshine ordinance is put here and we want to keep that sunshine shining on your conduct.\nSpeaker 11: Respectfully request that you table this ordinance. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And the next speaker is Bill Smith.\nSpeaker 11: Mayor Ashcroft, Vice Mayor Knox White and council members. I want to thank you by living by the spirit of the Sunshine Ordinance, a marijuana bill. You passed it, but you went back and reheard it later, eventually. So thank you for that.\nSpeaker 11: As you just heard from Mr. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, there are a number of people in the community that don't trust the council for a number of things. And I think this is an opportunity for you to earn back some of that trust for certain areas.\nSpeaker 11: And and that is by keeping the Open Governance Commission, making sure that they have enforcement powers. And so the preferred option is, as you heard from the League of Women Voters, to leave the null and void in and work for that.\nSpeaker 11: And you heard the we have a couple of attorneys, Robert Sumwalt and Paul Foreman, both have opinions that would slant more and direction of the alternative, that this council does have the power to delegate, that those things you might find that the housing authority and also the electrical utility probably make policy, too, is my bet.\nSpeaker 11: And the housing authority used to be part of the city at one point. So what happened and I think it was during the time the Sunshine Ordnance was in effect, that's another opportunity you might have had. There's also a procedural way to do this.\nSpeaker 11: You can just decide, okay, you're going to suspend, as you heard the league, when voters ask you suspend all action. And once somebody files a complaint and it never becomes law, so it doesn't have to be declared null and void, you just suspend action until it's clear whether it's a sunshine committee and you've heard and you've disposed\nSpeaker 11: of the the complaint. And then you can also in an emergency. If this I know something's come up an emergency ordinance, you're going to require something like a five unanimous vote of all sitting council members, which would be five, to go ahead and override the the sunshine the government committee to get something passed in a hurry if\nSpeaker 11: there is a complaint about it. So you have an opportunity here to maintain confidence, increase confidence.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Smith. And the next speaker is.\nSpeaker 1: Curt Peterson, then Paul Foreman, then Trish Spencer.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening. I already introduced myself earlier. I'm not surprised, Jim, that you don't remember a lot of things about that first meeting.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Peterson. We do not countenance ad hominem attacks from the podium. Will restart your time. But you are not here to address individual council members, but the entire body. Wait a.\nSpeaker 7: Second. It's an actual fact. Mayor, I can't state fact. I was making a point that I too do not remember all the things that were in the Commission's bylaws and rules. It was presented to us by our city attorney, Janet Kern, at that time.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Laura was also there. Jim, was there two other people besides myself who were the original people on the commission were there. We took the bylaws without any question, no discussion whatsoever about it. I brought up one key point in that is someone makes a complaint and that if the board doesn't uphold their decision or what their\nSpeaker 7: ruled, the ruling was in their favor, that they were banned for making a request. Again, I think three or five years. Well, a long time. I thought that was inappropriate. But the bottom line is, we were given the the right to do that.\nSpeaker 7: That hasn't changed. That was in the original one. I want to say, whoever the attorneys team here brought up more questions than answers about this new ordinance that you're talking about. I cannot believe you would respond to it.\nSpeaker 7: He can't give us any answers. It's kind of like the same defense Republicans are doing as far as in the Senate right now. I want some answers. Not well, I don't know. The bottom line is, if you had a city attorney that was doing their job the night that this was in question, they should have actually aired\nSpeaker 7: with caution rather than not saying we're going to go along with it. I don't see a problem. Why not just say, wait, we'll look at this. Let's take a step back. We'll make sure you're taking all the teeth and all any kind of authority that the Open Government Commission has away.\nSpeaker 7: And that's a shameful.\nSpeaker 0: Q Thank you, Mr. Peterson. Our next speaker is Mr. Foreman. And be sure to speak right into the speakers. So we get into make sure to speak right into the microphone so we can all hear you.\nSpeaker 7: In answer to councilman's valid question about where this all came from, read the minutes of October 18th, 2011, starting with page four. City Council knew exactly what they were doing when they passed this ordinance. They specifically said, We do not want council policing its own process.\nSpeaker 7: And that's what they did. They were proud of it. They unanimously passed it and their city attorney vetted it. Now, I must state that the staff report is dead wrong in saying the ordinance had not been reviewed since 2011.\nSpeaker 7: I served on the commission in 2015 when we reviewed the ordinance line by line and made several revisions there to a city attorney. Was there didn't say a word about this enforcement provision. Both Attorney Schwartz and myself have conducted email useful dialog with Council member Knox White, and we've written to council and to the city attorney.\nSpeaker 7: However, our city attorney has not seen fit to dialog with us and attempt to resolve these differences. We are not attorneys litigating against the city for the benefit of our clients. We are citizens of this community or donating our legal research in the public interest.\nSpeaker 7: The A.C.T. letters suggest two options that could retain significant enforcement powers in the AGC, while avoiding the issue of delegating legislative powers. If neither of those suggestions satisfy council or the city attorney, I suggest that we follow the procedure followed in 2011 before the audience with adopted appoint a Sunshine Task Force, including a representative of the City\nSpeaker 7: Attorney's Office to resolve our differences and present recommendations to council. I would be happy to serve on such a group. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: And Spencer, then Serena Chen, then Brian Schwartz.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, counsel. Staff I agree with the city attorney's recommendation on this. I want to thank you for your research. I did hear the comments of members of the public that they do not trust council. I would submit that the response of not trusting council is not to implement something that is illegal or to continue with something\nSpeaker 2: that is illegal. I think the body of law and the position that the attorney, our city attorney has made is correct. This has never been challenged in our city. It's the first time it's happened. I think that's why we're all looking at it.\nSpeaker 2: We weren't looking at it before because it hadn't occurred. That's why we're looking at it. The night of the ordinance, when it came to us, we did look at our city attorney. They did make a decision of it being within the Brown Act.\nSpeaker 2: When it came up for the second reading again, the issues were made. The city attorney weighed in. This is actually the third city attorney that has ruled on has come out on this. We had Janet Kern, we had Michael Roush, and now we've had your office.\nSpeaker 2: They have all landed on the same position of counsel being able to move forward and take action. And so I disagree that if people don't trust the council, you don't vote them in or you recall them, you don't implement the wrong law.\nSpeaker 2: It is very important that this law is it is clear. And so I hope that you do. And and in regard to the Open Government Commission, they're like every other commission. They should be they make recommendations to council.\nSpeaker 2: They do not supersede council. They don't. So thank you very much and good job. City Attorney.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Sabrina Chen Mischief.\nSpeaker 8: But evening, Mayor Ashcroft, members of the council. My name is Serena Chen. My middle name is Theresa, which is named after the saint of lost causes. And it starts with a T, and it rhymes with trouble. Basically, I'm the person who filed the Sunshine Ordinance complaint at the urging of several elected officials in this city, not on\nSpeaker 8: the council, who, after I told them what had occurred, insisted that I file a complaint and challenge this. I come to you just as a resident of Alameda of over 20 odd years, and I spent 27 years as a public advocate for smokefree, air laws and tobacco control laws.\nSpeaker 8: So as in that role, I've attended over 400 city councils, school board and whatever meetings in every single city in this county and in neighboring cities as well as neighboring counties. Every single time anything came up on the agenda, that was in the discussion of the city council that I attended that was different than what was being\nSpeaker 8: proposed in the original agenda. The city attorney or someone on that council would lean into the mic and say, Excuse me, Madam Mayor, or excuse me, but I think if we're going down this route, we need to look at whether we want to go with the provisions we have as written or whether we want to rewrite it\nSpeaker 8: and bring it back in two weeks. Thanks to that law, I went to the city of Dublin so many times because they kept changing provisions that I saw the hills turn from green to yellow to brown. I wanted a residency there, but it was a pain to have to adhere to the Brown Act.\nSpeaker 8: But it was also something that I felt was part of fairness and part of how you run a democracy and good government.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mrs. Chen. Our next speaker is Mr. Schwartz. Yes.\nSpeaker 11: Madam Mayor. And Council members. My name's Brian Schwartz and the current chair of the Open Government Commission. I'm a civil rights lawyer locally. I have the greatest respect for all of your volunteerism in coming and dedicating all these hours, and also for all the citizens who come here late on a Tuesday night to do this because of\nSpeaker 11: their civic engagement. And that's really what I'm here talking about, because the value that we have of openness and encouraging this kind of civic engagement is why we have the Open Government Commission, and it's exactly why it's so important to reject this amendment at this time and give it some more time to figure out the right way\nSpeaker 11: to go about this. The I'm concerned by the city attorney representative's effort to minimize what happened with the open government, commissioned by suggesting, first of all, by burying the lead and saying we agreed on nine out of ten things when the one thing that was really driving this was the one we disagreed on.\nSpeaker 11: And then by saying there wasn't such agreement, when in fact unanimously and very strongly the open government commissioners appointed by all different Bense from the city rejected this idea just as they had of of of eliminating the authority and just as they had previously remanded back to council the the ordinances on the on the dispensaries.\nSpeaker 11: And I think that's very important. Commissioner, I'm sorry. Councilmember Desai I made it really important question, which was what harm is there here? And the answer was very telling. It was it's hard to tell. And that there's might be potentially a sort of incongruence.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. On the other hand, what's the harm of not eliminating null and void? I mean, I'm sorry, of eliminating null and void. It is that we have an absence of due process, Brown Act violations and people suing the city who otherwise wouldn't need to.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Schwartz. And our next speaker. That's. That's all of our speakers. Okay. Numerous speakers. No one wants to take a speaker, slip out. Okay. With that public comment is closed and we come back to the city council.\nSpeaker 0: Who wants to lead off on this one? Councilmember Vella.\nSpeaker 9: Um, so I guess I have a few more questions and incorporate them into my comments as well. In Section nine, we lay out a timeline essentially that starts from when the complaint is filed and it reads 30 business days, which is about six weeks, and that's to schedule.\nSpeaker 9: The hearing. And then again, a formal written decision on the matter can be at a continued meeting within 30 business days of the conclusion of the hearing or at its next regularly scheduled meeting. And I guess my question to the city attorney's office is, have we you know, it's been raised about due process and timing, and I\nSpeaker 9: have a concern about these kind of extended timelines. On the one hand, I, I, I understand wanting to have time for parties to meet. On the other hand, depending on the ordinance in question and the impact that it could potentially have, I'm wondering if that sort of timeline really makes sense.\nSpeaker 9: So do we look at that when when this recommendation was put through and why 30 business days? I mean, that's.\nSpeaker 6: Sure that.\nSpeaker 9: The.\nSpeaker 6: Time the 30 business days, I realize that it sounds like a long time, but part of it is informed by the process that happens to get this thing on calendar. You know, you've got to coordinate a bunch of schedules together and sometimes it doesn't always align.\nSpeaker 6: And if there's a question about sort of shortening that or making it more aligned with how an ordinance would be sort of rendered null and void so that or that or a clear, incorrect recommendation so that the counsel can kind of get to it in time.\nSpeaker 6: That's something would have to involve sort of the city clerk's office, because that's a part of the sort of the nuts and bolts that our office isn't directly responsible for, but we want to be sensitive to those needs as well.\nSpeaker 9: So I think my concern is we have all these other commissions are former mayor Trish Spencer referenced that we have a number of commissions. Those commissions tend to meet monthly or at least have a date held. Is it possible for us to you know, I get that they're they're they're under this ordinance meeting twice a year.\nSpeaker 9: But to say sunshine or open government commission, whenever a new commission is convened on an annual basis, come up with regular meeting dates, because it seems to me that it's inherently not transparent to not have kind of dates held because then the person filing the complaint doesn't necessarily know what date it could be heard on the other\nSpeaker 9: parties that might be of interest. Don't know when that date is, but if we have a date held and the commissioners I'm on the lead abatement JPA, for instance, and, and in October and November of every year we get together and we say, is there a, you know, third Thursday of the month that works for everyone to\nSpeaker 9: have this meeting? So is it possible for us? Because it seems to me that those are the types of transparency issues that potentially exist, where we could get rid of a provision that says something like 30 business days.\nSpeaker 1: And I'll just give you some past practice just as a little maybe hopefully helpful.\nSpeaker 0: You might ask.\nSpeaker 1: The Open Government Commission. Two meetings are on the first Monday. And so when we've had a complaint, I've always attempted to schedule on that first Monday because then, you know, that's kind of the date that people are used to and whatever.\nSpeaker 1: But sometimes the complaint, it can't make the date. The complaint is required to be at the hearing. So we've had to have some flexibility to accommodate both sides because the complainant is can't have the matter heard if they don't come to the hearing.\nSpeaker 1: That's part of the provision. And so we've had to juggle it sometimes to like a Wednesday instead or, you know, if they needed another day.\nSpeaker 9: But if there is a date that's on the calendar is being held, then the complainant could look at that and know that's the date that the meeting occurs. It's the same thing that happens with the RAC or the planning board.\nSpeaker 9: You know, if you file appeal to planning board, planning boards meetings or planning boards meetings and you basically make it work. So I'm a little concerned that and I hear what you're saying, it's it's just seems like it's odd that we're allowing potentially a delay in actually hearing a matter that I think is of concern.\nSpeaker 9: Because if we're trying to legislate something, I think that there needs to be some set process in an expeditious manner to achieving an outcome in that whatever the outcome may be. The other question that I have is, you know, if we remove null and void, what is the remedy?\nSpeaker 9: So let's say that that and again, you know, is it just that there's a recommendation and why would somebody go to the Open Government Commission as opposed to just filing in court? Because part of. This is really about getting curing the issue as soon as possible and doing it in a way that removes kind of all the\nSpeaker 9: legalese and removes these legal barriers of having to go to court. And so I'm just wondering what what is then the process?\nSpeaker 5: So Councilmember Vela, as currently proposed, the process would be that the commission would still hear the matter, just like they would do today. And if they believe that there is a violation, they would issue a recommendation to the originating body, which details their findings.\nSpeaker 5: And we believe that by having that recommendation and decision be issued, it serves a number of purposes. We believe that that the open and transparent nature of that decision will probably cause the original body to seriously reconsider the decision that was made.\nSpeaker 5: And second of all, we believe that any decision that was ultimately, you know, an unfortunate hypothetical ignored by the city, that decision would probably be accorded significant way by a court on judicial review. So we believe that that issue decision has multiple important audiences and it serves an important function.\nSpeaker 9: So I guess the other follow up to that is if there's how does that work? Because the city attorney's office represents the city, but then they're overseeing and advising the AGC. And if the AGC makes a recommendation against the city or against the process, that's been advised by the city, how does that work?\nSpeaker 5: So there's well-established judicial precedent that allows a government office to establish ethical walls when appropriate, when conflicting bodies are being represented. And this happens fairly regularly throughout the state. And I'll give another example. When there is an appeal to a personnel board, it's another perfectly good example where the city attorney's office may both be representing the decision\nSpeaker 5: maker, which is the Personnel Board and the Human Resources Department, who is proposing a particular discipline and judicial decisions indicate that a government office can impose ethical walls so that its lawyers can represent both functions faithfully.\nSpeaker 9: So I think, you know, and my questions are really about the process because I am concerned in having this be a transparent process for people to file complaints. And I want this to be more than just about the ordinance that kind of triggered this whole conversation, because there's other ordinances that we've passed through, you know, emergency ordinances\nSpeaker 9: and that sort of thing. And I'm concerned if there was an opportunity to say, put potentially hit pause on one of those, what the what the impact would be. But it also seems like some of these issues are process issues that perhaps and what happened with the cannabis ordinance was really unfortunate because of the timing and us\nSpeaker 9: going out to recess that there it snowballed into a bigger issue and there were longer delays. But it seems like maybe we could explore other procedural ways of streamlining this so that those sorts of issues don't happen and where we could region dice something and hear it sooner and have a way for the item to be heard\nSpeaker 9: sooner so that we can get resolution on it sooner. So that's kind of where I'm coming from. I, I guess I'm a little concerned about removing the ability to have this be a kind of decision to call, to call the question really on the council without going to court.\nSpeaker 9: And that's that was the value of this provision when I spoke with some of the people that were on the council at the time was that this would allow that sort of decision to be made with some teeth.\nSpeaker 9: But but to really put the council's feet to the fire without having to go through a long, drawn out court process. And the benefit to the city was that it wasn't a long, drawn out court process. So I'm a little concerned if that incentive goes away and you have another council in place that then doesn't really care\nSpeaker 9: what the logic says and moves forward and just keeps the thing on the books. And then we're in a situation where we're in court litigating over this issue.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Who wants to go next?\nSpeaker 6: Happy to.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Desai.\nSpeaker 6: Well, thank you very much. You know, we do need a tool that allows us, the city council, to catch ourselves in instances when we make decisions. The details and substance of which was not publicly noticed, public noticing is key so that the public so that the people can weigh in on matters, so that they can give us\nSpeaker 6: their opinions on how we might vote and we on the issues that we might think about as as we deal with these public issues. NULL and void is meant to be that tool. It's meant to be that tool that deals with situations when council comes to a vote and a decision on a topic.\nSpeaker 6: The public wasn't properly informed about. NULL and void is a tool that supersedes a council decision and therefore represents a power that, when exercised, is above the city council. But the problem with null and void as I look at it, the problem with null and void is that it has no basis in our city charter.\nSpeaker 6: Instead, the city charter at Article 3-1 vests all power in the city council. It is true that in the next article, Article three, Dash two, Article three, Dash two says that the the council can delegate powers to commissions.\nSpeaker 6: But Article three, Dash two also says that it can only do so in a manner consistent with the charter. So it has to be consistent with the prior Article three, dash one. So to me that's an important sticking point, is understanding what is the basis of null and void and how does that align with the basis of\nSpeaker 6: the council's powers? Now, when we talk about powers, the city charter even becomes even more specific. When you look at, for example, Article one, dash two, dash de D, one of the powers that the city council is vested in is the ability to the ability to make and to enforce laws.\nSpeaker 6: And when you put it all together, three dash, two, three dash, one article, one dash, 2-d. What that means is that the City Council is invested in making powers and rules, and we can delegate that to commissions and boards, but we cannot delegate it in a way that places the council in an inferior position.\nSpeaker 6: And the way in which null and void is being exercised, I believe, does that. So the remedy is to correct a null and void, but still come up with a tool that deals with situations where the public isn't properly noticed.\nSpeaker 6: I would encourage us not to be so adamant that null and void is the only tool. It's altogether possible that members of the public, members of the Open Government Commission can come up with a variety of other tools that checks the City Council.\nSpeaker 6: When we make a decision that was not public informed, for example, it's altogether possible. Just thinking off the top of my head. This The Council can create an ordinance that allows the LGC to like like a football referee throw a flag.\nSpeaker 6: And when they throw a flag and in situations when they clearly point out that a decision was made when the public was wasn't adequately noticed, when that flag is thrown, then subsequent ordinances, council cooking come up with it is that while the decision of the council can move forward, there would still be certain penalties.\nSpeaker 6: For example, perhaps one of the penalties is in those decisions where the public will see what the public was not fully formed, informed. Then the council has to vote on a 4 to 1 basis on on those matters.\nSpeaker 6: So it becomes it doesn't altogether eliminate the the decision of the council. It just raises the bar of how to move that that issue forward. So council can still exercise its authority. In other words, these are just kind of off the top of my head ideas that that we might look at, that the public might look at\nSpeaker 6: as to continue to create the right check on the city council. When we I mean, there are times when we're going to make accidents, when we're going to make some decisions, when we didn't correctly publicly inform the residents.\nSpeaker 6: But when we create those checks, um, let's do so in a way that's aligned with the city charter. And I have no doubt that there are, there are ways, there are many ways for us to create the remedies that are similar to null and void that are and as effective.\nSpeaker 6: No one on this dais doubts the effectiveness of null and void. It stopped a certain decision in his track. City Council had to go back and redo that decision. No one no one doubts that. But that decision, though, has to grow out of a basis.\nSpeaker 6: And that basis is our city charter. And so as we correct null and void. I would hope that the Odyssey and the public as well as City Council figure out ways to do so in a way that's aligned with the city charter.\nSpeaker 6: And I and I have no doubt that we can.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I mean, you can buy me your next wait.\nSpeaker 4: Go ahead. Thank you. I I'm going to find myself in high alignment with Councilmember Desai. I appreciate the way in which he laid that out. So I was on the on the Sunshine Task Force with Jeff Mitchell, who was charged with writing the the section for the Open Government Commission, which took a section, and he was the\nSpeaker 4: former editor of the Alameda Journal. Transparency was extremely important to him. And at every single meeting when we talked about this, the rallying cry from Jeff and others like voters and I would say the other four of us on the task force was that the Open Government Commission needed to have teeth.\nSpeaker 4: This was not just supposed to be a body that says, hey, there's a problem and then everything moves on. How do we make sure that when they make a finding, something happens that causes the city to kind of sit up and reassess?\nSpeaker 4: Well, I appreciate that. The staff report in the step reporting that the idea that just a finding that is written that says there's a violation will make the city really reconsider it. I think the one time this has happened shows that that was not true.\nSpeaker 4: In fact, the city went into full battle mode to tell the ask, you know, basically ask the Open Government Commission to reconsider, not just null and void, but reconsider their decision that a sunshine violation had happened. Right. Everybody put all their power into discrediting the finding of the of the sunshine of the of the Open Government Commission\nSpeaker 4: rather than just re agenda using the darn thing and having it done. I mean, that was what was kind of silly to me about this whole thing. It was such an easy cure. And yet we spent months talking about this thing.\nSpeaker 4: So I agree completely with with Councilmember de Sug and others that I mean, obviously, the staff lawyers, three of them now that, you know, from as as they have explained it to me, because I am not an attorney, but well, that null and void is not a legal finding.\nSpeaker 4: And now that we have all this written about this, it is problematic, you know, that there was a lot of concern around this issue that somebody would sue. There is going to be an issue, whether it's around development or something else that is hot and right, that's going to drive somebody to file a sunshine complaint that's going\nSpeaker 4: to put us in a legal position. And if we have some, you know, we're going to end up in court at some point in time fighting null and void and in it. So but at the same time, I am not supportive of just removing it and hoping that at the end of the day, the Open Government Commission's\nSpeaker 4: finding is, you know, it's just a finding that sent and hopefully somebody cares enough to take it back up. So, you know, the way I've been thinking about this, knowing that we, you know, it's problematic for this for this body or anybody to undo the actions of the council.\nSpeaker 4: You know, we also know that that sometimes actions of the council take a little time to to. You know, we we we give we set up ordinances all the time that take 30 or 60 or 90 days to actually really get up.\nSpeaker 4: You know, we might pass a law, but enforcement of that law really doesn't happen for 60 or 90 days if a violation is found. You know, I would propose that that we have a sunshine ordinance that requires that that agenda, that item get agenda based on the next, you know, reasonable agenda for consideration.\nSpeaker 4: And that that consideration be both a finding of concurrence or non concurrence with the with the Open Government Commission's finding, but also that it would be that it would include a an opportunity to cure the issue. So actually what they would do is actually put some pressure.\nSpeaker 4: The simplest path would not be to find against the Open Government Commission. The simplest path would be to rehear the item and cure the item. You know, and I think that that if we were to write something that also basically said that we will maintain the status quo during that 30 or 40 day period to get it\nSpeaker 4: back up on that agenda. Basically, that means that there's, you know, back to the trust issue. There's not that time for, you know, staff or the council to somehow sneakily do a lot of work on the on it while it while it's in existence.\nSpeaker 4: It doesn't it doesn't remove that. But it but it basically gives the the the public the opportunity to come back to that body at a publicly at a properly noticed meeting and to weigh in not only on whether there's violation, but weigh in also on the issue itself, publicly noticed at that point in time, it's you know\nSpeaker 4: , I don't want to you know, it's not the same as null and void. It does not undo that. I've heard that. Oh, it's not on doing it because the council can also pass it. But if the council doesn't repass it, it's been undone that I do.\nSpeaker 4: You know, I, I am convinced of that. Yeah. I'm going to end by just sharing a quick story. As an advocate, I went to the. California Transportation Commission. They badly noticed something that was very significant and had a big timeline.\nSpeaker 4: And we filed a complaint ahead of the meeting that that they had not noticed this properly. And then because they didn't know who I was, I sat with with the staff and the county and the council members. The staff said, don't worry about it.\nSpeaker 4: You just pass it tonight, give everybody the assurance that it's going to happen and we'll just bring it back and notice it in 30 days. Right. And then they realized that I was there and everybody ran off and and huddled separately.\nSpeaker 4: I want to make sure that we're not getting ourselves in that situation where basically we you know, it's just that the finding is just kind of perfunctory. I think Councilmember Vela spoke, too, that there needs to be something that puts a little bit more teeth in that, which brings it back and puts it on the dais and\nSpeaker 4: on tape and allows people to stand up and speak. And so if we can come to something that replaces null and void with with an acceptable alternative, you know, I can support it. But, you know, and I'm not I'm not supportive of the staff's recommended language of just removing one void and kind of hoping shame is enough\nSpeaker 0: . Councilmember Councilmember O.D..\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Thank you for also letting me not go first.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: I was working on it.\nSpeaker 3: And trust me, you're not the Iowa Democratic Party, so we will get out of here on time today.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have results? I was working.\nSpeaker 3: So I also appreciate Councilmember De Sykes comments. Sometimes the non-lawyer distills it in a way that we all can understand. I would just add to it that, you know, there's also the restraints of the United States and the California Constitution.\nSpeaker 3: So we could pass any law we want. We could think it's great because Jeff Mitchell thinks it's great. But if it's not constitutional, you know, it's it's not it shouldn't be there. So and I also appreciate both the suggestion from the vice mayor and the suggestion from Councilmember Dysart, you know, that we do replace it with something\nSpeaker 3: . So there needs to be some teeth to it and there needs to be some calling out of the council. If we do do something that violates the Sunshine Ordinance, you know, like the idea of immediately putting it on an agenda that we either agree or disagree and then move forward one way or the other.\nSpeaker 3: And then, you know, if somebody wants to sue, I mean, there's an opinion on the sunshine or the Open Government Commission, you know, that will have some weight. And then if the council doesn't really have anything supporting of that, you know, I understand that.\nSpeaker 3: My only concern here and, you know, I think this is going to not be an issue 99% of the time. So let's not let's not ignore the elephant in the room on what happened here. My my concern is that someone and I'm not saying anyone did this because I think the people on the Open Government Commission exercised\nSpeaker 3: their judgment based on their understanding of the rules. And I am not saying anything about the person who filed the complaint, but others, not anyone in this room, not anyone who filed a complaint did say to me that they were going to use that to try to overturn the cannabis.\nSpeaker 3: So and which normally wouldn't be a big deal. Right. But the problem that happened was there was an election, there was a swearing in of new people that many people in the community thought had different opinions on it, and that they were going to they were going to use this as a sword to implement their policy and\nSpeaker 3: not as a shield to protect the public from non transparency. So and I remember my first meeting, we spent the entire time discussing Del Monte, you know, I can't believe it's still not ground broke yet or maybe it's close to it, but it's been, you know, five, five months.\nSpeaker 3: And I guess the argument that was made and maybe it's a legitimate one was that the agenda item said we were discussing delivery only cannabis and then we just and to dispensary's and yet we decided to bump that up to four.\nSpeaker 3: So I think that was kind of the that was kind of the gist of the complaint and the finding. So I went back and I remember I went to the meeting on December 2nd, 2014. I sat in the audience back where Catherine sitting now and we had a discussion on the first reading of the De Monte Project\nSpeaker 3: and 35 speakers got up. I just kind of the minutes and then after the public comment had closed and the DEA and the masterplan were there, there was a suggestion from the dias to reduce the number of housing units from 414 to 380.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Well, if you're not a housing advocate, you probably don't care about that. But if you are a housing advocate, you didn't go to that meeting thinking that was going to happen, and you didn't go to that meeting thinking that was going to happen after the public comment was closed.\nSpeaker 3: So and then we had the second reading, which I wasn't there for, and then we had the thing. So I mean. I think we've got to be careful about what happens during that period when we have a switch, because I think this can be used in a negative way.\nSpeaker 3: Now, that's the people that, you know, were against this project, probably didn't know this tool was there and didn't use it. But, you know, if there was a motion to move approval of adding an addendum to modify the master plan on the date to not include city portion A partial B reduced the number of housing units from\nSpeaker 3: 414 to 380. And they didn't know about it. I mean, to me, that sounds like a worse violation than anything this council was accused of. So if there are some safeguards that can be put in place during that interim, when there's a change or there might be a change to try to undo a council decision, you know\nSpeaker 3: , I'd be open to hear what that is. And the but you know, on the flip side, you know, we don't want to jam things in at the end either. So there has to be some safeguard there. So giving some direction either to the C or staff to develop some replacement that meets the needs that I've heard from\nSpeaker 3: my colleagues. But also, you know, doesn't allow this to be used as a sword when there's a change of election, I think would be would be would be super critical to me.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So I'll go last and thank you all for your time and attention and your emails, your remarks this evening and to staff who's put a lot of time and effort into this. There is an adage in law which is bad facts make bad law.\nSpeaker 0: And I do recall the particular item that generated the complaint that Ms.. Chan referenced, and I, I was upset about that, too. But at the same time, we have to follow the law and my colleagues to the left and the right.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Desai again, Vice Mayor Knox, while I think articulated very well, I come at the remedy a little differently what our authority is, what our authority is, and we have to respect the authority that has been delegated to us, and that is not delegate role to others.\nSpeaker 0: I do feel that the order to cure remedy is adequate and sufficient. I would certainly be interested in the you see the Open Government Commission if they so choose to, coming up with something that incorporated some of the suggestions we've heard to make sure, for instance, that there is a set time period so someone's complaint does not\nSpeaker 0: languish. But I would emphasize that we have a city attorney's office that takes great pride in doing good legal work and advising the city and its boards and commissions. Everyone is certainly capable of making mistakes because we're all human.\nSpeaker 0: But this particular issue has been scrutinized extensively, and I am confident in the in the outcome that we've seen. The question was asked the rhetorical question, so what's the harm if we just let the the null and void clause stand?\nSpeaker 0: The harm, I would say, is essentially what Councilmember Desai alluded to. This is not a power we can delegate. And then two points that Councilmember Odie raised. It isn't just about an improperly noticed item. That's not the only thing the null and void remedy could be applied to.\nSpeaker 0: It could, in the right set of hands be applied to a law that someone doesn't like. And that's that's that's a concern. And again, we were elected to do this job. Now we've heard it said, by gosh, even the League of Women Voters that people don't trust elected representatives.\nSpeaker 0: Well, here's the thing. I say this often. If you choose to be an elected office, you better have thick skin, a sense of humor and a backbone. And I can attest to the fact that every one of us sitting up here don't all agree come from different perspectives.\nSpeaker 0: But we're working awfully hard for the people we represent. And then I would further quote my favorite president of recent times, Barack Obama, who in his closing address to the nation said, And if you don't like the folks who are representing you and you think you can do better, pick up a clipboard, collect the signatures, and run\nSpeaker 0: for public office. And and I wish more people would serve on our boards and commissions. Use that as a. A stepping stone to elected office. I happen to think we have great representative government in this city. We've come to a point of disagreement on this particular item, but I take very seriously the advice that the city attorney's\nSpeaker 0: office has given us. I've read the references to the case law and the city charter. And so I, I support the amendments, all of them that the city attorney's office is recommending. But I would also entertain a further remedy not to bring, you know, null and void light back, but to make sure that the intent, the spirit\nSpeaker 0: of this law is is honored. And it was something I was going to say, and there is something that concerned me in the staff report, and perhaps it was paraphrased in correctly, but it it did talk about it.\nSpeaker 0: And I, I didn't feel that Mr. Lay was burying his lead when he talked about there was agreement on nine of the ten amendments. There were. I think it's maybe just a way to transition in, but be that as it may, it is stated in the staff report and maybe I'm interpreting it wrong, but the commission further\nSpeaker 0: stated first they didn't agree with the null and void decision. Commission further stated that it would not support any similar amendment. So I'm concerned that what that means what if first, if indeed that's what the commission said, because they didn't go back and listen to the the actual meeting.\nSpeaker 0: But I would expect that our boards and commissions will work cooperatively and collaboratively with our city attorney's office and vice versa because we respect all of our times. But I think that we can come we can maybe have some additional guidelines that make sure that people who have a complaint are taken seriously.\nSpeaker 0: I mean, the analogy to the the penalty, the ref, you know, dropping the the filing the penalty, I will say coming so soon after the Super Bowl was a little painful. But hey, but but that it does stop stop the game until they go and, you know, review the the tape and look at it from all those\nSpeaker 0: different angles. I still didn't think that was a touchdown the other night. But anyway, I'm over it almost. But you know something that makes sure that, yes, this is taken seriously. You you tell us that that we there needs to be in order to cure it comes to the city council as quickly as possible.\nSpeaker 0: And we don't, you know, buried under the rug. So if someone, you know, wants to suggest a way to do that, I'm all ears and that's all for me. Thank you. Let's start with Councilmember Velvet and the vice mayor, then Councilmember Odie Councilmember.\nSpeaker 9: So there was a suggestion earlier by a couple of members of the public that there may be some sort of task force similar to the original task force or that it go back to the Open Government Commission for them to to weigh in on.\nSpeaker 9: I think when we had the task force, we didn't necessarily have the AGC and I don't know what happened in 2015. There was a reference to a review of that. I don't know if that was in connection with being on the AGC because I know Mr. Foreman has been on it before, but perhaps the AGC could could\nSpeaker 9: weigh in and let us know what options may work or that they think they could recommend in terms of giving something, giving some teeth to this. I also think looking at the process in nine B, because right now we're saying that we want it to come back quickly from the GC.\nSpeaker 9: But again, if there's six weeks between when the complaint is filed and the AGC hears it, that could be problematic. And maybe we want to give them some direction that they can hold. Meeting dates that can be posted on the calendar.\nSpeaker 9: If there's no complaint filed, then they can just not have their meeting, which is what other boards do. And then the other thing is, with the Sunshine Ordinance in place, that quick turnaround may be difficult. So if they have a regularly scheduled meeting that this is heard at and depending on when in the month that is, yeah\nSpeaker 9: , we may need to have some clause in there that allows them to expedite re agenda using it before the council because of the delay. And I'm out of time.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 4: I have on our screen, I think I saw staff working on something. I was just going to ask if they pass a. They had language they might want to propose based on the commentary that they've heard. Jon Stewart Sorry, it's not up here, but I was going to warn you that I see you typing, okay?\nSpeaker 0: Like, I can't. I can't even read it that small.\nSpeaker 4: I just. It seemed like SAP was trying to possibly put put together something. And, you know.\nSpeaker 0: His staff want to comment.\nSpeaker 5: Oh, so, Madam Mayor, if I may.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, I would need a mirror to read that.\nSpeaker 5: We've been we've been hearing the council comments and then speaking.\nSpeaker 0: To the microphone, please.\nSpeaker 5: Oh, yes, we've been hearing the council's comments. And we've we're we've drafted up something for the council's consideration, which I believe addresses both the vice mayor and council member de Suggs concerns that they've raised, which is that one, it comes back to the original commission or the council as soon as practicable, and that this amendment further requires\nSpeaker 5: the originating body to make a decision based on the OGC recommendation, which may involve agreeing and caring or disagreeing, and that it further takes into account the vice mayor's concern, which is that lots of things could be happening in the meantime, so that this amendment also provides that the city would take all necessary actions to the extent\nSpeaker 5: authorized by law to maintain the status quo.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, let's hold that thought, because I think the vice mayor inlets, were those your comments that you could see them?\nSpeaker 4: I mean, yeah, that that looks I just wanted to find out if there was possible language before we started possibly developing new task forces and whatever else.\nSpeaker 0: But yeah, I am. Thank you for that. Were you done in our call on council member?\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I'm not so sure about that maintaining the status quo because there is a law in place about ordinances and when they take effect in 30 days and so on and so forth. So that would kind of overrule that.\nSpeaker 3: And I don't know if that works, but I like the idea of council development in about you having meetings regularly scheduled that if there is some issue that it can be addressed ASAP. I also think that ONGC probably is the best body to come up with ideas on how they think that a violation can be enforced most\nSpeaker 3: effectively. I mean, there's a fine provision there and we all care about the budget and that may be something that that maybe can be enhanced. The question I did have, though, and we kind of didn't touch on it because we went into the No.\nSpeaker 3: One void, but this whole idea that it supersedes other laws, I mean, does that mean anything that it that's different in the past is changed or anything that we passed in the future that conflicts which hopefully neither of our none of our staff lets us do how?\nSpeaker 3: I just was not sure about that.\nSpeaker 5: So council members and the laws cannot anticipate what you would do in the future and it cannot bind future councils. So what it does is that it supersedes laws that were in existence at the time of the adoption.\nSpeaker 5: In fact, when you adopt an ordinance, you always adopt a provision called implied repeal, which is in any law that's inconsistent with the ordinance that you're adopting at the time. It's a is repealed to the extent necessary to effectuate your new law.\nSpeaker 5: So your new law will always take precedence.\nSpeaker 3: Well, we should make that clear. That's all. My time is up.\nSpeaker 0: To the council everyday.\nSpeaker 6: So with 70 seconds, I'm going to speak quickly. It's hard for me to understand whether or not the proposed language has teeth, but I'd love to get input from the AGC or anyone else on that on what's proposed here.\nSpeaker 0: And I will make a motion to extend the time because I think this is a an important issue and I don't see that it serves any. Okay. How much time, folks?\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry. Four.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. Motion to extend time. 5 minutes for everybody.\nSpeaker 6: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. That's a second. I've got a motion second on favor. I, I think Councilmember Desai seconded. Okay. Okay. So continue, Councilmember.\nSpeaker 6: So that's basically my point. I said it in 17 seconds. I would bring it input as to they understand our broad parameters or broad parameters. It has to be consistent with the charter as we discussed it. But we also have to believe that within those parameters we can still come up with something that's that's that has teeth\nSpeaker 6: , but it's just not null and void null and void concept.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So your recommendation to send it back to the board, you see, and that would be the remedy I would favor as opposed to convening yet another subcommittee because I think we want to keep this moving forward. Um, who else didn't finish their comments to Councilmember Gallo?\nSpeaker 9: I was going to say, I think having it go back to the AGC makes sense. In this instance, I'm a little wary about drafting something tonight and then adopting it, especially in light of the topic that we're discussing.\nSpeaker 9: So I'm not going to be supporting I think that that clearly there are other ideas that exist that are out there. Perhaps these can be brought to the GC and discussed and noticed properly and all of that. I do think, like I said, creating a process similar to call for review or appeal to planning board where we\nSpeaker 9: have kind of a date set and a turnaround possible would be helpful. Keeping in mind the other provisions of the Sunshine Ordinance that require us to notice things ten days before and all of that, and because I do worry about an instance, let's say, where it's not a cannabis issue that we're dealing with, but we're dealing with\nSpeaker 9: an exigent ordinance. For instance, when we were looking at the issue that impacted a tenant who was going to be evicted, who was a Holocaust survivor, and the emergency ordinance that we put into place, and if that had been formed, what that would mean.\nSpeaker 9: So and perhaps it's the AGC that can make the determination to suspend certain rules for noticing and still comply with the Brown Act. But maybe not because it's already been been heard and is now being cured, that there's a shorter time frame for adding to the agenda, an item like that.\nSpeaker 0: And my observation would be that since this is the first reading of an ordinance, I think these amendments might take this a bit beyond what we first contemplated and would recommend would would need another first reading anyway. So I would certainly support sending it back to the Open Government Commission.\nSpeaker 0: But again, to work with the City Attorney's Office and I am quite confident we will follow the city attorney's recommendations, but I think this can be made a bit better and give some reassurances and however that needs to be worded.\nSpeaker 0: Council Would we at least say that this this amended draft might be a good starting point to to work from?\nSpeaker 9: I.\nSpeaker 3: I don't think so. I don't like the maintaining the status quo because you're basically overriding the state law.\nSpeaker 0: Well, no, I'm saying to send back to the the Open Government Commission very fine.\nSpeaker 3: Without that, the city shall take all necessary action sentence.\nSpeaker 0: If you will. That could be directed to staff. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Just adopting it as is with the direction that we've all decided we want to give.\nSpeaker 0: I don't know. I don't know what adopting the ordinance is now. It's going to be modified. Why would we adopt it now.\nSpeaker 9: For a new first reading?\nSpeaker 3: Life we adopted and then tell The Odyssey to come back in two or three months with replacement. I don't want.\nSpeaker 0: That. But then in the in the intervening time, this would be the councilman, I mean, councilmember like to be on the council member city attorney.\nSpeaker 5: I think Mr. Councilmember Otis point is to adopt a staff recommendation with direction to review. I think that's okay. So I think you're in agreement with the mayor.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Speaking a different language. Okay. Got it. Okay. So are you making a motion?\nSpeaker 3: Sure. I'll make a motion to.\nSpeaker 0: Adopt the.\nSpeaker 3: Adopt the staff report as written with direction for staff to work with the Open Government Commission to find a replacement, an effective replacement to the null and void remedy based on our discussion and anything else they may have.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We have a motion by Councilman Brody and a second by Councilmember de suck discussion Vice Mayor next week.\nSpeaker 4: So I won't be supporting this motion. I feel that we should. Like I said in my comments, I'm happy to remove null and void, but I'm only going to remove it when I know what the remedy is. Because I think that removing something like take all necessary actions to maintain the status quo puts us into the they're\nSpeaker 4: now making a finding, but everybody just ignores it. And it's basically it has it it removes any meaning and teeth. I'm also going to just we didn't talk about it but the the the fine $250 public works getting the transportation commission getting fined for violating the Brown Act $250 transfer is going to send 250 bucks.\nSpeaker 4: Right. You know, laughing to the finance department. I mean, it's not you know, I don't the fine doesn't really unless we're getting into tens and tens of thousands of dollars, it's not going to have a real big impact on noticing in this body because it doesn't the people getting fined are not the people sitting here.\nSpeaker 4: So I have.\nSpeaker 0: Interject an inquiry.\nSpeaker 7: Or.\nSpeaker 0: Would you like staff direction to include that you would like the fines and penalties provision revisited. I even if you're not supporting the motion, would you like to see that be part of staff direction? But you don't have to.\nSpeaker 0: Sure.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, I just I guess what I'm trying to say is I.\nSpeaker 0: Think that's a good point. And then you had more to say.\nSpeaker 4: I do, yes. I would like to make sure that our direction is that that, you know, to to the mayor's point earlier, it's I have very much appreciated hearing from almost all the, uh, open government commission members and their concern about removing null and void, but that the direction is that it's going to be removed and that\nSpeaker 4: we are accepting the city, the city attorney's position on this. And therefore, I just want to make sure that if we're going to send it back to the Open Government Commission, that we're trying to find that balance where, you know, to me, all necessary actions to maintain the status quo gets us to a place where they're not\nSpeaker 4: repealing it. They're just slow walking there. The roll out, their vice mayor, former vice mayor, city council member, fellow still vice mayor, in my mind, you know, came up with the, you know, the idea of maybe if it's an emergency know, maybe there's some exceptions where whatever else.\nSpeaker 4: But but I, I feel like for me in order to repeal this, I need to know what I'm repealing it for. I don't want to repeal it. And then in three months, come back and say, yeah, we can't agree on what's going in there.\nSpeaker 4: So now it's just repealed and we have nothing. So which, which I fear is, is a possible outcome.\nSpeaker 0: And I will just add that I couldn't support anything that is keeping the null and void option in because we've heard several times over that it's it's not a valid remedy given the charter and our authority. So. But we have a motion in a second.\nSpeaker 0: Is there any further I'm sorry, Councilmember Rivera.\nSpeaker 9: So I'm not going to be supporting this motion and for similar reasons as the vice mayor, I would also I think this has been on the books for a long time, and then we knew it was an issue when the complaint got filed.\nSpeaker 9: So. For me, it seems like it's been on the books. We knew there was an issue, there was legal research and we've kind of gone back and forth. And so I don't see the harm in waiting another month or 60 days for the GC to weigh in and give us a remedy because it has been on the\nSpeaker 9: books for this period of time and I would like that process to happen and to have some teeth proposed that we can all live with and then put it in there so that it works. So I'm I have a similar position as the Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm looking forward to the AGC coming back with something.\nSpeaker 3: But my only point to that is I think we all agree that that is not an authorized remedy under our Charter or the Constitution. So, I mean, if we had an ordinance that says you can discriminate against women and we know that that's unconstitutional, would we just keep that in there until we fix it or would we\nSpeaker 3: take it out because we know it violates the law?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We have a motion. We have a second. All in favor.\nSpeaker 6: I just want to say you.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, yes. Sorry.\nSpeaker 6: Yes. The quick comment I want to make is I do think that the points that Councilmember Vela and Vice Mayor Knox White are valid, because if we do take a vote, we run the risk of of taking the leverage out that the GC might have because we've made a decision that we're going to.\nSpeaker 6: But but by the same token, Councilmember Odie raises a good point that if there is a rule that that is in contradiction to, to a higher rule, do we sit around and let it be? So for me, I'm going to have to believe I'm going to have to have faith that the city attorney is going to work\nSpeaker 6: in good faith with the Open Government Commission and the public in creating the language that that is akin to null and void, that does provide some teeth, but is aligned with how we're interpreting the city charter. So I'm going to have faith that that's going to occur even as we move forward with staff recommendations.\nSpeaker 6: So that's why I will remain in favor of the vote.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All in favor.\nSpeaker 4: I oppose. No.\nSpeaker 0: No. The motion carries 3 to 2. And I just want to comment that this has been an excellent council discussion and I really appreciate the very thoughtful comments and also the melding of different suggestions and perspectives. Thank you, everyone.\nSpeaker 0: We look forward to this coming back to us and I'm ready to go on to the next item, people. Okay. Remind me what that is. 60, 60. We have 60 up next. Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me. We are conducting a council meeting.\nSpeaker 0: Excuse me, Mr. Peterson. I'm going to call a break if you don't leave now. Miss Smith, would you please would you please give us the.\nSpeaker 1: Can I read the title really quickly? Thank you. Introduction of Ordinance Amending the code by adding new Section 20 3-9 Personal wireless service facilities in the public right away, and amending Section two Dash 59.3.

All right, so now we're done.\nSpeaker 7: Okay, here we go.\nSpeaker 0: We are going to resume with six C. Everyone could please take your seats. We're about to resume. Appreciate it. Thank you, Miss Potter.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Good evening. I'm Debbie Potter. I'm the city's community development director. And the Community Development Department consists of three divisions building, planning and economic development. And we began an active rebuilding effort regarding our economic development division about 18 months ago.\nSpeaker 1: And key to that effort was hiring an economic development division manager to develop and guide programs and policies that focus on business attraction, expansion and retention efforts that grow our city's employment and tax bases. And we were very fortunate to hire Daryl Doan as the new economic development manager.\nSpeaker 1: And fittingly, today is Darrell's one year anniversary. He started with the city of Alameda on April 7th of 2014, and he's going to be presenting an overview of the economic development division, its work, its accomplishments and our proposed initiatives going forward.\nSpeaker 1: And this presentation is being presented in part to help inform the City Council's discussion of Vice Mayor Matt Orestes referral regarding reconstituting the Economic Development Commission and best practices for engaging the business community in our economic development initiatives.\nSpeaker 1: So with that brief introduction, I'd like to have Daryl come up and make his presentation about the Economic Development Division and its activities. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. You're done. I. Happy anniversary.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. But good evening, Madam Mayor.\nSpeaker 8: And members of the Council. I feel somewhat special because I got my own little action.\nSpeaker 4: So.\nSpeaker 8: As Debbie said, yes, it's my one year anniversary. And that's completely coincidence. Honestly is. But. So let me start this way. So, as Debbie said, I oversee the city's economic development division. We were in the process of preparing a sort of overview, high level presentation for you, owing to the fact that you were a new council and\nSpeaker 8: I'm a new employee and it's a new division. And so we thought it was probably time to check in. And then in the midst of doing that and working to get that agenda rise, which took a little longer than we thought, there was a council referral on reestablishing the Economic Development Commission at the March 17th Council meeting\nSpeaker 8: , Council was reminded that we would be bringing forward a presentation and then specifically asked that we bring back two additional items as part of that presentation. One was an update on where we stand with the city's economic development strategy document.\nSpeaker 8: And two was a recommendation from staff as to what we how we think, whether or not the EDC should be reached out. So that's what we're doing today. So I'm going to go quickly through a PowerPoint presentation. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with area right and left.\nSpeaker 8: Okay, I got it. I'm going to go quickly through this PowerPoint presentation and cover the sort of high level overview of how we spend our day in our newish economic development division. I want to point out, however, that this is this is what's the slides that you will see in the public will see are not an adopted\nSpeaker 8: strategy at all. It is simply our work program that we are implementing at the staff level and it is different than the actually adopted economic development strategy. I didn't want there to be any confusion over that. So economic development in Alameda one year in.\nSpeaker 8: We have a mission. And our mission is and this is a this is a mission statement for convenience. But it's our sort of guiding principle. Our mission is is quite simple. It's to grow the city's tax and employment bases through the diligent pursuit of business retention, expansion and attraction projects.\nSpeaker 8: In that order, I would add related real property development because most businesses need a roof over their head to be successful and workforce development. So those are our three sort of focus areas. Actually, we have seven focus areas as the slide shows.\nSpeaker 8: So we organize those three goals more properly called around seven strategic focus areas. And they are, as you can see, they're marketing cluster and sector development, commercial development, retail and small business development, workforce development, external relations and then data and benchmarking.\nSpeaker 8: And there's no magic to these. It's how many cities organize the fourth city. I've worked for doing economic development. It's just sort of how economic development is organized in these sort of focus areas. Some cities have different ones, they have more, they have less.\nSpeaker 8: But but these are what I think are appropriate for where we are with Alameda right now. So I'm going to run through these really quickly and just touch on them in a little bit of detail. So one is marketing any city that is doing quality economic development needs to needs to build a brand and a compelling story\nSpeaker 8: around what are its business fundamentals. Then you need to go spread that brand around city, region to state and nationally to an extent that you can. And so that's what we're doing. And how do we do that? We do that in a number of ways.\nSpeaker 8: We do it through traditional and web based advertising quality collateral materials. The printed word is still important robust web and social media presence, attendance at regional and national trade and industry associations. All of those are avenues by which we do this.\nSpeaker 8: What you see on the screen there is just. Very simple advertising. We do more sophisticated advertising, but these are just very simple advertising showing our primary advantage, which is frankly locational. So number two. Cluster and sector development. So the way to think about a local economy is to divide it into sectors.\nSpeaker 8: Right. So we're talking broad categories, nonprofit businesses, biotech, high tech, maritime industry. In the case of Alameda, there are ten or so that we have identified. And a year into this process now that we think are either thriving and successful might be showing some weakness and we need to preserve them or our areas that we can grow\nSpeaker 8: . And that's kind of how you do it. You identify the weak sectors. You make a qualitative and quantitative decision about whether that sector is still viable. And you identify the strong ones and you try to grow them and you try to tailor programs and incentives around those sectors.\nSpeaker 8: So that's cluster. Cluster and sector gets confused. Sector is a group of like type of businesses. Cluster is a group of businesses in one geographic location such as Spirits. Alley is a cluster. Maritime is a sector sometimes a sector is a cluster, but not all.\nSpeaker 8: So number three, commercial development. So I'll get to retail in a minute and that's critical. But commercial development basically means any commercial activity that is not retail. So we're talking office industrial, advanced manufacturing, high tech, some of the sectors I just identified.\nSpeaker 8: The great thing about Alameda is that it's an island. It's also one of our weaknesses from an economic perspective, but it's also a strength in that we have a very confined geographic area and it's easy to manage conceptually.\nSpeaker 8: Where are our businesses from a commercial standpoint? Are businesses are primarily in two areas. They're in two business parks, which you're aware of Harbor Bay, Business Park and Marina Village Business Park, the opportunity and there's some in the neighborhoods and some on Park and Webster, you know, in the form of like above retail, small lawyers and dentists\nSpeaker 8: and things like that, and in some cases on the first floor. But the business parks are primarily commercial opportunities of existing real estate. We have new opportunities, which are primarily Alameda Point and Alameda Landing Phase two and maybe a few infill sites.\nSpeaker 8: So we're an island. We have limited real estate opportunities. We've got to make the most of those. When we're looking at commercial development and, you know, we're in the process of doing it. So how do we do that?\nSpeaker 8: We coordinate with brokers, owners and tenants and our business associations to do business recruitment and facilitate expansion. I touched on retention, retention, expansion and recruitment, and I said, that's the proper order. And what I mean by that is and it's germane to commercial development, is that a city, a city always needs to be recruiting, but anybody in\nSpeaker 8: sales will tell you, don't lose your existing customer base while you're, you know, while you're in the process of focusing on drawing in new customers. So the simplest thing that a city like Alameda can do is make sure that our existing commercial and retail businesses are being taken care of.\nSpeaker 8: Right, that they are thriving, that their needs are being met, that when they call City Hall, somebody answers the phone when the trash can in front of the barbershop is overflowing. We take that call and we act as an ombudsman and we get that problem resolved all the way up to a large user employing six or 700\nSpeaker 8: people who may have a lease coming up and they may be thinking of leaving. We build strong relationships. We'll know that. They'll tell us that. And we can act to forestall, you know, any kind of a relocation threat.\nSpeaker 8: The goal is to do retention so that you never have to deal with a relocation threat. We'll always meet that goal, but that is the goal. And then, of course, you know, recruitment, we all know what that is.\nSpeaker 8: Recruitment. It's we go out and spread that gospel and work with these owners, brokers and tenants to bring in businesses that have high value in terms of employment and growing our tax base. Paying, paying taxes. Number four, retail and small business development.\nSpeaker 8: So we separate. This is part of commercial, but we separated it out because I find in talking to community members and even some council members that when people think of what is economic development, they think of this, they think of Main Street and they think of shopping centers.\nSpeaker 8: That is an important part of economic development, but it is one of many sectors. It is one of those ten sectors. That's how I look at it. It is arguably, though, from a tax perspective, the most critical sector, because unless the numbers have changed, I'm not aware of it.\nSpeaker 8: Sales tax is our fourth largest source of general fund revenues. For many cities, it is their first source of general fund revenue that is driven largely by the large ticket items. Cities are size that have automobiles. They have, you know, 110,000 plus square foot, big box type of retailers.\nSpeaker 8: They have high value ticket sales in things like electronics, appliances and furniture. We that's where we fall. That's where we are weak is in those sort of high ticket sales. Where we are strong is on great. You know, we have two great, very successful sort of main street level commercial districts with great business owners.\nSpeaker 8: And in the aggregate, you know, individually, the ice cream shop doesn't generate a whole lot of sales tax, but in the aggregate, they generate a lot of sales tax, especially when you think of our main street districts have shopping centers in and of themselves.\nSpeaker 8: That's really what they are. Again, we're an island, limited geography. We know exactly where our retail is. It's in it's in eight or so shopping centers and it's in two commercial districts. And we know where it can go.\nSpeaker 8: It can go to Alameda Point, it can go to Alameda planning phase two and a few other areas. Five workforce development. What is it? So basically, you know, a city like Alameda has a jobs housing imbalance, right? We need additional jobs at density.\nSpeaker 8: And so that's why when we're focusing on commercial development, we're focusing on taxes. Yes. But arguably, more importantly, generating jobs in good paying jobs, because if we're going to solve that jobs, housing imbalance and the attendant traffic issues that come with it, in my opinion, the answer is not no more growth.\nSpeaker 8: It's about bringing in growth that generates the kinds of jobs that will allow people who are currently commuting off the island to quit their job in Walnut Creek or Oakland or San Francisco because there's a there's a there's a good replacement job here.\nSpeaker 8: So I am very focused on not just jobs, but quality jobs. And you need jobs all across the spectrum. You need service jobs. Because for some people, that's their job. But we need we've got a lot of that.\nSpeaker 8: We need higher quality, better paying jobs in a range of industries. And that's the focus. When we when we have companies that are already here, though, they have they have workforce needs. They need to hire new people because they're scaling up their production.\nSpeaker 8: They need to hire 150 people in a short amount of time. We help with that. We build through our relationships. We know about those scale up opportunities or new companies that have come to the island to lost some of their workforce because of relocation and need to hire up.\nSpeaker 8: We can't control where those companies choose to draw from, but we can work with them to make sure to the to the greatest extent possible. Those new hires are Alameda residents. I don't care about people outside of Alameda coming to work for Alameda companies.\nSpeaker 8: Well, I do in the sense that they need to have employees to be successful. What I really care about making sure that Alameda residents get hired for those jobs, and that's critical. And we do that by assisting those employers.\nSpeaker 8: We assist employers and we assist employees. We have programs for both. We want to help Alameda residents find jobs with our employers. We want to help those employers hire Alameda residents. We host job fairs, we partner with workforce development agencies, etc., etc..\nSpeaker 8: And that's how we do that. Number six is external relations. This is real simple. We we are out there. We are out there regionally. We are out there locally and we are out there statewide. I go to conferences, I go to trade shows, will be doing even more of that.\nSpeaker 8: You know, some sometimes the public scoffs at that. Why are these bureaucrats going to these fancy trade shows in Las Vegas? It's not because we're partying. We need to be there. We need to have a presence. That's how we grow our brand.\nSpeaker 8: Number seven and finally is data and benchmarking. I'm a big believer in this and we've spent a lot of time over my first 12 months here trying to get a handle on, you know, economics, by definition is about numbers.\nSpeaker 8: We need to know our numbers. We need good quantitative data so we can make good qualitative decisions. We've been looking at all of this. Some of that groundwork was already laid before I got here. I'm trying to take it to the next level.\nSpeaker 8: Actually, in your consent agenda tonight, you approved a contract whereby we'll be buying employment data from the State Department of Employment Development. Seems like a simple thing, but when I got here, we didn't really know who are top employers are.\nSpeaker 8: We knew anecdotally, but we didn't have the hard numbers and we need hard numbers. So we'll be doing more of that and you'll see more things coming to you where we're going to, you know, frankly have to buy third party data.\nSpeaker 8: Some of it we gather ourselves and some of it is original work. So those are our seven strategic focus areas. So just quickly, key programs and initiatives, this is not everything, but I just wanted to get you a sense of some of the things that we do in our programs.\nSpeaker 8: We run a formal business visitation program. We target the top 75 aggregate tax generating and largest employee businesses because with limited resources, those are the companies that we need to make sure first and foremost to be taken care of.\nSpeaker 8: It's those who employ the most people and generate the most revenue. So we have Alameda Service, which is our new permit expediting program, which has been extremely successful. There have only been one or two issues that we haven't been able to resolve.\nSpeaker 8: And this this has allowed us to move. We've never had a higher volume of permit or planning applications. And conversely, they never move faster than they are right now. And that's a testament to the building planning and my division.\nSpeaker 8: We are absolutely committed to improving our reputation, real or perceived. On that point. We have a new business welcome program where the mayor sends out a letter to anybody who pulls a business license, whether you physically locate in Alameda or just doing business here.\nSpeaker 8: We've started business meet and greets and some of you participated in that. And I appreciate that. We have a we have a burgeoning, I would call it Startup Assistance Program, where we work with prospective new small business owners to start their business.\nSpeaker 8: It's not yet an area of expertize for us, but we're going to grow that. We're partnering with the Small Business Development Center, who's been very helpful with us on that. I talked about workforce development. We actually have a on May 7th, we are hosting in partnership with Alameda Unified School District at Encino High School.\nSpeaker 8: We are hosting a youth job fair. That's an example of something that we do. There'll be more information about that coming around. But, you know, it's an internship program for high school students to find jobs if they maybe aren't on a college track and they need a skill when they graduate.\nSpeaker 8: So just an example. We have an annual broker event that we've done two years in a row. We have another one coming up right also on May seven. And you all will be getting invitations for that tomorrow. We have a print advertising program.\nSpeaker 8: We publish a monthly business newsletter. It's actually ten times a year where we try to sort of get the word out about all of the good, positive things you all should be receiving that.\nSpeaker 2: Um.\nSpeaker 8: And we will be continuing that program. We have a burgeoning social media program. We are tweeting. We are on LinkedIn. You know, you have to be doing that. It's not yet eclipsed the Internet as the primary source of information, but it probably will soon.\nSpeaker 8: We have an Alameda Island shopper campaign, which is one of our small business programs where we you know, we essentially guilt trip residents into shopping locally as opposed to taking that money out of town. We'd like to move that from a guilt trip to a real incentive, and we'll be working on that.\nSpeaker 8: Your trip is a good thing sometimes, right? Why should residents take their money to other communities when they can spend it here and keep their dollars right here in this community? And then as you voted on tonight, we manage the city's two business improvement areas in partnership with our Business Improvement Association.\nSpeaker 8: Quickly. 20 1415 Key accomplishments. So we created the division. That's a big step forward. We hired a division manager. That's a big step forward. We are still transitioning from doing economic development through redevelopment. To doing traditional economic development activities in the absence of that funding source.\nSpeaker 8: That is a tricky transition. Many cities in the state are going through that. We are no different. We don't have that pot of money anymore. So we have to rely on other things like our charm, like our guile, like our willingness to pick up the phone and our tenaciousness when we are going after businesses.\nSpeaker 8: We have engaged the business community. I don't know if this is a high number or a low number. I think it's high approximately well, exactly 289 separate times through March 30th. Those are distinct meetings with businesses might be the same business multiple times.\nSpeaker 8: If you drilled down two distinct businesses, it's probably half that number. But that's a pretty tremendous outfit. Mind you, the economic development division has two and a half FTE. There's a couple other people like our base reuse department and our leasing team that dabble in economic development.\nSpeaker 8: But only two and a half of us that are doing this on a full time basis. We've met with almost 300 businesses in the last calendar year. We've we've had a number of attraction successes. We've have a number of expansion successes.\nSpeaker 8: We've placed 21 separate advertisements in local, regional and national publications. We've done that brokers event two times. We're doing it a third. We've gone to ICAC in Las Vegas, San Diego and Monterey. We had three very you know, we had three East Bay EDA Innovation Award finalist and two winners and nobody else had that.\nSpeaker 8: And we were named by Sunset Magazine or Sunset magazines as a finalist or Best Municipal Makeover, which is, you know, great.\nSpeaker 0: And before we continue, I made a motion to continue past 11.\nSpeaker 5: So moved.\nSpeaker 0: Have a second. And we need at least three votes to continue. All those in favor by passes unanimously. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: I'm actually almost done, so bear with me future programs and initiatives that you will see coming through our budget process or through the budget process. We're going to talk about this in a minute. The mayor and cities the mayor and I've added and city council's economic development advisory panel.\nSpeaker 8: We're going to be reinstituting the facade improvement grant program contingent upon your approval of our budget request. We are starting what we call sector focus groups and we have the first one with the maritime sector coming up on April 30th where we will sit down and have a one on one with the leaders of that sector to\nSpeaker 8: get their perspective and understand how the city can help them succeed. We are going to be redesigning our business website and creating micro breakout sites for both commercial recruitment and local shopping, something that doesn't exist right now. We're going to be instituting a formal commercial recruitment marketing campaign, and we're going to we're going to do a better\nSpeaker 8: job of reporting back to the council through a series of quarterly reports, which I think will be helpful for you and it will be helpful to the public. Okay. So let's get to the councilmember referral. So just quickly, the two things that we were asked to cover were strategic plan and reestablishing the economic development.\nSpeaker 8: So we have a strategic plan. It was adopted by council in July of 2000. The former economic commission actually instituted a review of that plan in 2005. And I know some of you sat on that and went through that process.\nSpeaker 8: The EDC did that by establishing a subcommittee to guide that review process with extensive community engagement. The revised plan was adopted by Council in 2008. We are putting a budget request through the budget process in front of you for monies to update that again, because it's time we've come out of the dark winter of the Great Recession\nSpeaker 8: and we're booming and we need to redo that plan and make sure it's keeping up with market realities. So we would hope to have that funding and be able to go through that process with you again, because it is definitely coming this quickly.\nSpeaker 8: The 2008 plan has these seven broad strategy imperatives in it. Some of these are still relevant. Some of these perhaps are less relevant. We need to go through that process of updating what these strategies are and of course, their implementation their implementation steps associated with all seven of these.\nSpeaker 8: But I didn't list them here. So that's the current status of the 2008 Economic Development Strategic Plan. We hope to start that update process in the new fiscal year and call it very soon the 2000 1516 ish feature plan as to the Economic Development Commission.\nSpeaker 8: So some of you have the history of this and I wasn't here. So I'm working from the record from from our files and sort of recreating what this has been and where it came from. But it was created in 1990, if I've got my date right.\nSpeaker 8: Around in 2012, the membership was reduced from nine members to seven members. I don't presume to understand why specifically, but more importantly, in October of 2013 at Stat's recommendation, the Council at that time disbanded the Economic Development Commission.\nSpeaker 8: Not because we didn't think that they were useful or had been doing their job, but because the agenda had been dwindling. Redevelopment was disbanded itself, and much of what I'm told, much of what the commission was doing was considering disposition of development agreements, owner participation agreements and A's that were tied to redevelopment as a funding source.\nSpeaker 8: Among other things, some policy activities such as the aforementioned strategic plan. And so staff recommended that we disband that program 19 months ago, or that commission 19 months ago. And in its place, we asked council to adopt these three objective driven.\nSpeaker 8: That's what they were called objective driven policies that would take the place of that EDC. And they were the use of ad hoc committees and tax task forces. We had been doing that prior to that October 2013 disbanding action and we will be doing it going forward.\nSpeaker 8: I think I've been told that the two best examples were an America's Cup ad hoc subcommittee and a fiscal sustainability committee that went back to 2008. I could envision the Council using that ad hoc committee process to guide staff in updating the Economic Development Strategic Plan.\nSpeaker 8: And in fact, when we come back to you with a formal recommendation, that's probably what we would recommend. As the vehicle to do that. Number two is is just enhanced coordination and information, information sharing among businesses and associations.\nSpeaker 8: This is ongoing. We have really picked up our game in that since I came on board. And that sounds self-serving, but it's not. I mean, we have to be engaged with our chamber, our three business associations, owners, brokers, tenants.\nSpeaker 8: We have to have our ear to the ground to get good information. And we've been doing that. And some of those partners are here tonight, and I think they would attest to that. And it's been very successful. Debbie sits on the board of the chamber.\nSpeaker 8: I sit on one of their committees. We're very engaged with Waba and Pizzi, and GABA is going through its own resurgence and growth phase. And we've been very supportive that in fact I just presented to ABA last week at one of their monthly mixers.\nSpeaker 8: Number three on that list was create something called a Mayor's Economic Development Advisory Panel. So I want to touch on that for a minute. This is one of the three objective driven approaches to replacing the EDC that we have not done yet.\nSpeaker 8: It is. It is. It is, in our opinion. Time to do that now. The purpose of that mayor's economic government advisory panel, which I've been calling midcap, because everything needs a good actor government. But that's not official. Is to enhance the business climate of Alamitos, business parks and commercial districts and support the growth of Almeida's identified commercial\nSpeaker 8: and industrial clusters and sectors. I've added by providing both strategic policy and tactical business attraction and retention advice to the council and staff. So that came right out of the October 2013 staff report that whereby the Council created this concept, the intent was for it to be flexible, focused and ambassadorial.\nSpeaker 8: So in the absence of real sort of projects for an EDC to approve because you know, they already signed off on Alameda Point, they already signed off on Alameda landing. Those things are happening and we don't see any major new projects to come forward from.\nSpeaker 8: From a transactional standpoint, I'm speaking in the absence of that and shifting from a redevelopment focus to a more traditional economic development focus, we need this panel to help us close deals, reach out to prospective businesses, to help us with our recruitment.\nSpeaker 8: Nothing helps us to recruit a biotech company like asking a guy like Adam Elsasser, who runs a very successful biotech company in town to make a phone call, to have a lunch with a prospective business that is incredibly valuable and really can't be measured.\nSpeaker 8: And so we want this to serve an ambassadorial purpose. We want it to be focused so that if the council or staff feels that we need a third party to evaluate an issue or to give us advice on a program or to review a program that we might be proposing to give us that comfort level, to know\nSpeaker 8: that it was properly vetted because not everything we do makes it to the council. Right? We would use it for that purpose and we want it to be flexible. The intent when this was set up was to not be a standing commission in the way that a formal commission is to meet perhaps formally once or twice a\nSpeaker 8: year. And then for this panel to be available to the mayor, to the council and to staff to call upon when we have specific issues that we want to address. These are some of the activities that were envisioned in October 2013 and that I envision using this for now if the council wants to move this forward.\nSpeaker 8: There was a recommended structure in that staff report. I think formal has been adopted, but we would envision seven or so members, you know, nominated by the mayor or perhaps confirmed by the council two year terms. The intent was for it to be composed of high level business executives, CEO types of some of our largest companies and\nSpeaker 8: some of our important smaller companies, a good cross-section of sectors and CEOs. These are the ten sectors or so that we've identified as being meaningful right now. You can read them. Certainly, that's a very debatable list about what are Iraqi sectors that are.\nSpeaker 8: Reasonable minds can differ on that. We think that's a pretty good list for now. So. That's a presumptive slide. Next steps before a recommendation. So I'm going to do this backwards. So what we are recommending specifically in response to the EDC referral is that staff is recommending not to reestablish the Economic Development Commission and instead do two\nSpeaker 8: things. One is continue to use the ad hoc subcommittees, continue to use our outreach, extensive outreach to the business community as to tools that we will continue to use and will do that in an ongoing fashion. And then we think it's time to sort of flip the switch and turn on this panel that exists that was created\nSpeaker 8: but has never been impaneled. And we would recommend that in lieu of bringing back the Economic Development Commission. And largely because in just as a sort of a final word for me, the reasons that the Economic Development Commission were disbanded only 19 months ago.\nSpeaker 8: If you go back and read that staff report, we think they're all still valid. We don't think anything's changed. Reasonable minds can disagree on that. So we're going to stick by our recommendation. We don't see any reason to change it and and suggest this to you.\nSpeaker 8: And so now go backwards if you agree with this. And that's totally your prerogative. Obviously, we would think that next steps for creating or for paneling this panel because remember, it already exists is to develop we would develop a representative list of CEOs and business leaders from a set of economic sectors, maybe the ten I showed you\nSpeaker 8: , maybe some different ones. We would work with the mayor to identify and recruit seven or so advisory panel members. I presumably for counsel consideration, although I don't want to be presumptive about that. Exactly what the process would be is up to you to just start recommending.\nSpeaker 8: That would come to you for consideration as well as sort of a formal staff report and recommendation on how this should be set up, what the terms are, who the people are, how many times they should meet. And then we would convene that inaugural advisory panel meeting sometime in the summer of 2015.\nSpeaker 8: And that's our recommendation. Belleville answered questions.\nSpeaker 0: We have two speakers that. Counsel Did you want to ask any questions at this point or. I call the speakers. All right. First would be Michael McDonough and then Rob Rado. And any other slips on this one.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening, Mayor and Vice Mayor, council members and staff. I'm Michael McDonald, president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. And I just wanted to come here tonight to show the chamber's support for the city staff's efforts in the economic department, specifically for all the work they've been doing to develop the strategy and the development.\nSpeaker 7: So far that's been really moving Alameda forward in the last couple of years. We really have worked well with Darrell and of course, Debbie, and we really appreciate the efforts they're putting out. And it's really interesting because as Darrell began with his mission, the chamber's mission parallels that very closely.\nSpeaker 7: We really do want to support the existing businesses to retain them. We want to make sure that they get the opportunity to expand in a in a business friendly environment and, of course, to attract new help attract new businesses to town.\nSpeaker 7: In fact, we have worked with the city on many of the key programs that they describe there, including the new business welcome the new business meet and greets. We've done a number of times we were at the and helped with the annual broker event.\nSpeaker 7: We've really promoted the Island Shopper campaign and we're currently working on the job fair that on the Committee for the Job Fair that Darrell mentioned. So we really have worked in conjunction with the city and a lot of these economic developments.\nSpeaker 7: So we really enjoy that and have had a great relationship. And it's very true that that they have reached out to us in the last, I don't know, a year and a half. We have had a very good working relationship and we too have reached out to the other business associations to try to form a better bond\nSpeaker 7: so that you guys can hear the voice of the business community, not just from the chamber, but from all the business associations. So I believe that the city's goals and the chamber's goals, we're working in conjunction in the same direction.\nSpeaker 7: It's been very rewarding for both parties, I think. And regarding the second part of Darrell's presentation regarding the Economic Development Commission, you know, when that when that in 2013 was disbanded, they did come to the chamber and we worked closely with them to think about what it would look like if that wasn't here.\nSpeaker 7: And we understand why, you know, it had I wouldn't say lost its purpose, but but it changed with the lack of redevelopment funds. And I think the the recommendation at that time for the advisory panel was a good one and we supported that.\nSpeaker 7: And we look forward to working with maybe the advisory panel. And if you decide to do the economic commission, we look forward to working with that as well. But we do support staff's recommendation to move forward with the advisory panel and even to the point where we would look forward to to directly participating on the advisory panel\nSpeaker 7: , if so, chosen. So the main thing I wanted to say here tonight is we really appreciate the staff's efforts and the economic development strategy that they've been enacting over the last several months, if not years, and want to support them in their recommendations to you tonight.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. You.\nSpeaker 0: Erato and then Karen Bass.\nSpeaker 6: You're back to your post 11 p.m. time slot.\nSpeaker 7: Well, I have the over and under at 1030, so I win. Rob Reiner, executive director of Park Street Business Association, soon to be the downtown Alameda Business Association. Don't worry, you'll get the invitations. We're in concurrence with the staff report.\nSpeaker 7: We were sorry to see the economic. Development Commission go under. But at when it did go under, it had kind of petered out and run its course. This sounds like a wonderful plan. Hopefully it will work. Hopefully. Mr. Madden Rossi came to our board meeting a month ago, and we kind of talked about this a little bit\nSpeaker 7: . And we would concur with him that one of the things that absolutely has to happen with this panel is that the council needs to give this panel and staff some direction. I think that was one of the things that was absolutely we agree with Mr. Rossi that that was one of the things missing.\nSpeaker 7: Toward the end of the EDC. And we hope to see that. The other thing I got to tell you that I'm just thrilled to death to see up there. And boy, are you going to be hearing from me for the next couple of council meetings.\nSpeaker 7: The best thing that can come out of this. Is the reestablishment of the facade grant program. Oh, I'm so happy to see you all go like this. That was the best damn business program for small businesses this city ever had.\nSpeaker 7: And we were sorry to see it go. So if you folks can do whatever you need to do and staff can do whatever they need to do to make that happen. We are happy to participate in it again.\nSpeaker 7: And, you know, you give me a call, I'll walk you up and down the street and I'll show you every business that's got a facade grant program and every business that got one, it only improved the look of the street.\nSpeaker 7: So we hopefully you'll pass this this evening. We look forward to working with everyone, and I'll go ahead and take my shot. We'd love a spot on that little advisory committee. I'll talk to you later, but.\nSpeaker 0: Karen B. And then she's our last speaker on this item.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening, Mayor Spencer, members of the City Council and staff. My name is Karen Bay and I'm here tonight. First of all, I want to say thank you, Daryl and Debbie, for a great presentation. Whatever you decide tonight, I'm here to ask that you consider adding one more strategic focus, and that is tourism.\nSpeaker 9: Alameda point will become a regional destination if we get that approved and we can use this development to attract tourists to other areas of Alameda Park Street. Webster Street. There are other areas that have great potential for development.\nSpeaker 9: We were once a resort community and the development of Alameda Point and the Northern Waterfront can help us create this new industry. San Francisco tourists spent $9.4 billion in 2013, up from 8.9 billion in 2012. As a result, they collected over 600 million and sales tax revenue.\nSpeaker 9: We just talked about sales tax revenue being a huge component of the revenue. So I think this is a potential industry that could help us solve a lot of problems. We can attract some of those visitors from San Francisco by creating a theme a day in Alameda.\nSpeaker 9: I also want to mention that we were the finalist and Sunset Travel Awards this year, and I think we need to build on that. This is kind of an easy it's an it's an easy solution here. So if we use the Oakland model, Oakland has a full time person in their economic development department working on nothing else\nSpeaker 9: but increasing tourism in Oakland. The campaign is called Visit Oakland. She was previously a senior vice president of business development of the Santa monica Convention and Visitors Bureau and a sales manager at Tourism Whistler. That's the kind of talent that we need.\nSpeaker 9: All right. If we want to focus our attention on increasing tourism, we need that kind of talent as a result. Well, Oakland as a result increased 300 new restaurants. And Alameda in Oakland in the last two years, 110 new restaurants in the last six months.\nSpeaker 9: All right. As a result, Jack, London Square just landed an upscale food market which will be developed by Napa Valley developer. His name is Steve Cullen. So 5 minutes away from us, they're focusing on tourism. San Francisco is focusing on tourism.\nSpeaker 9: We need to add that. Please consider adding that to the seven strategic focuses. Just real quickly, some of the steps that we can we can ask our visit Alameda team to do is hire a marketing director, a CEO, a sales director to focus on rebranding Alameda as a tourist destination and create a goal.\nSpeaker 9: Bring 50 restaurants to Alameda and create art and culture and entertainment in Alameda, create a bicycle tourism plan and consider developing a hotel convention center at Alameda Point. We'll need to work with all of the what the Alameda Point developers and the Northern Waterfront developers to try to meet our goals.\nSpeaker 9: I urge you to consider this. I think this is a wonderful opportunity and it would increase our sales tax revenue. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Is our last speaker on the item council member. Actually, as vice mayor, this is your referral.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I've actually heard a lot of things that were on the plate of the Economic Development Commission in 1996, which resulted in the 2000 strategic plan. Among the activities that that commission took up was the downtown plan, which eventually was implemented, and that's the theater in the parking structure that you see.\nSpeaker 2: It is jump started Park Street. I do think that economic development is not an ad hoc. Um, activity. And I think that we need it now more than ever, that redevelopment is not in place and that we're still waiting for the successor to redevelopment funding.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's valid to. Look at a commission. Because the commission has all the trappings that are necessary to make sure that policies reflect. The entire nature of the city input from the residents. And those recommendations are formed in a agenda as measured.\nSpeaker 2: And a collaborative approach with. Public forums that the Commission meetings provide. It sounded like in this presentation that this mayor's economic development advisory panel. Is tracking along that. But I. I would prefer a commission that. Both through our regular Border Commission process for appointment and and confirmation.\nSpeaker 2: It goes through the regular process of having meeting minutes, agendas and reports to council, and I think most importantly gets direction from the council on what its tasks are. I think this council referral is still valid and I'd like to hear what my colleagues think.\nSpeaker 2: And I'd like to be able to make a decision on it tonight and delayed a couple of. Maybe three times because of long agendas and other things out of our control. But I think it's on the plate now.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Any counseling? Okay. Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 5: All right. Thank you. So I. I have to give considerable weight to staff's recommendation because it is staff who were tasking with the work of overseeing a commission. If indeed that's what we're to decide to do. When I was reading through this staff report and the the presentation.\nSpeaker 5: Nice presentation, Mr. Doane. It did strike me that. What a lot of the vice mayor's objectives and intent seem to be encompassed in many ways in the recommendations that came out of this this. I. This report, it seems that the advantage of an ad hoc committee is and it's laid out in the in the presentation on page\nSpeaker 5: 18 is the more flexible structure and approach accessing resources and personal contacts of the business community as and when needed to help close the deal or for other recruitment or development of particular expansion of particular sectors perhaps. And at the same time, I also see that in the.\nSpeaker 5: The staff report, there is a process for assembling members to address specific needs. I am mindful that the projects, the two projects that the vice mayor quoted, the theater and the parking structure, both very successful and I think have brought a lot of benefit to our city and to the Park Street area.\nSpeaker 5: Did both come about with redevelopment funds? And I heard the reference to, you know, at some point when there is a successor to redevelopment and I know there's been some talk in Sacramento and I know at least there's talk of it happening some time, but we're not there yet.\nSpeaker 5: So what I would prefer to see, although I have to say I also agree with the I think it was Rob Prado who and the vice mayor echoed this that. Whatever the iteration is, whatever we decide to do, it needs city council oversight and direction.\nSpeaker 5: And for that reason, I'm hesitant and I don't think I could support the recommendation that it be a mayor's committee that the mayor recommends. I would prefer to see an ad hoc committee assembled to address specific needs, and it might be, for instance, the update of the economic strategic plan or the strategic plan of the general plan\nSpeaker 5: , because that is a bit outdated, I think. But I'd prefer to see that sort of a committee formed and it can certainly come. I would want it to come to the City Council for approval of the members, but I'd like to hear from staff and our business associations and Chamber of Commerce who I think have the greater\nSpeaker 5: overview of what the what resources are out there, who to to tap for maritime or nanotechnology or whatever the sector is that we want to focus on. And I think that it is important to have the council oversight.\nSpeaker 5: And I but I'm wondering, is it mutually exclusive? I like the idea of the minutes and the accountability, but I don't know why the the council couldn't direct an ad hoc committee to do to do the same. And and again, because this panel is advising the entire council, I think it's a city economic development advisory panel or\nSpeaker 5: city council. But I do think it's important to hear, as Mr. Doane mentioned, at least quarterly, what some of the initiatives are and what progress we've made. I think we don't we don't toot our own horn enough sometimes that the the things that we're doing.\nSpeaker 5: So I think I want to see a hybrid kind of an approach, and I do want to see accountability to the council, but I definitely want to hear input for potential panel members from the business community and peers out there in the business community who I think are in a good position to help advise.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member, Odie.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Madam Mayor. So I'm I'm looking at the the vice mayor's referral, and I see a lot of overlap between the the roles of the Economic Development Commission, as he suggested it, and, and this mayor's advisory committee.\nSpeaker 6: So I think we're pretty close in agreement between the staff report and the vice mayor's referral on what it is that we want this group to do. I just think we're kind of a little at odds on what to call it, which I don't really care.\nSpeaker 6: You can call it a economic development commission. You could call it the mayor's committee. You could call it the mayor council committee, whatever. Doesn't really matter to me. And then we're also at odds over how much oversight and formality this commission should had.\nSpeaker 6: And I. I still. Are for the third time talking about this. I agree with the vice mayor that we need to have some type of, you know, formality and structure to it. You know, I was able to serve on the America's Cup Ad Hoc Committee.\nSpeaker 6: And I think what made that work is, you know, we had an event, the America's Cup. We wanted to take advantage of the economic opportunity and the tourism. And the then vice mayor at the time put in a referral to create this this committee.\nSpeaker 6: And it was made up, you know, of a few prominent business leaders and mostly maritime, you know, business leaders. So we were able to be focused on a task that was, I would say, very narrow and that is attracting, you know, maritime business.\nSpeaker 6: And the committee actually was able to help attract the Swedish team, Artemus, to be here. But I think that the goal of of this new mayor's committee or economic developed commission or whatever you want to call it, it was a little bit more broader, you know, focusing on Alameda Point, you know, being more more diverse in its\nSpeaker 6: membership, you know, from from different business sectors. So. I'd like to see if there's a way we can. Again, I don't really care what it's called, but and it sounds like the goals of the council referral and the goals of the the proposed mayor's committee are the same.\nSpeaker 6: We can find a way to to marry those together and do it in a way where there's still accountability and structure and compliance with our sense and ordinance and keeping things open and to the public. I mean, that be something I'd be more in favor and just to kind of.\nSpeaker 6: Go off topic for just a bit with Karen. Karen Bass. Comment. Last week I had a holiday. Cesar Chavez Day. I went on line, said what? I took the day and went away. And I did a search. Things to do in the bay area on one day and pull up this article in the chronicle and reading through\nSpeaker 6: and one day one of the things was a day trip to Alameda. I wasn't going to do that. Sorry. Wanted to get out of town. But you know, there's some merit to the idea that Alameda is now becoming a tourist destination, you know, at least for one day with with Spirits Alley and, you know, all the different\nSpeaker 6: family activities that we have. So, you know, I think that's kind of a good thing to add to the to the goals. But, you know, I still I'm not convinced that. I'm still. I still am in favor of the way that the vice mayor is proposing this.\nSpeaker 0: Every day.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. You know, when the matter first arrived to council to review the way the Economic Development Commission was operating and how we might modify and improve that. This was back in 2013 or so. At that time, I concurred with staff's recommendation to look into the approach utilizing an advisory panel, working with the mayor and possibly Knight\nSpeaker 3: , working with the mayor or the counsel general. That's a view that I still hold on and I hold it for several reasons. When I look at what we want to achieve through an economic development organization, and let's use that term broadly an economic development organization which could either be a commission or could be an advisory panel along\nSpeaker 3: the lines described through the mayor's task force. I really see two key issues. One is about function and the other is about attributes in terms of function. You can break that down into three areas that that an organization might play.\nSpeaker 3: It could be in the planning role. It could really be in the monitoring role. And finally, it could be in the implementation role. Those are key functions that an economic development organization can play. I think when I look back on the Economic Development Commission as I knew it and when I look at the panel, that's being a\nSpeaker 3: task force that's been suggested. I see the commission's role as having been more in the area of planning and and monitoring. And I see the task force role now being more about implementation. That is, use the phrase that's been used like closing the deal when projects come forward.\nSpeaker 3: And I think we're at a point where where we need to move fast. And I think we need to be nimble in this competitive environment. And I see something like the task force as achieving that. So to me, the key the key thing with regard to function is implementation.\nSpeaker 3: And I want an economic development staff working closely with council or the mayor working closely with key business leaders in town of which we we have representatives of major, major, major corporations, you know, ready to quickly, if not open doors and at least close deals.\nSpeaker 3: It's less big, frankly. Altogether possible. It's altogether possible. That there will be members of the Economic Development Commission. Who are not the right people. Send to a meeting where you have to close a deal. It's altogether possible that.\nSpeaker 3: Of the type of issues and concerns that they're most interested in. And it might not be one and might not be to. Are about. A frames. Signage on windows changing ordinances to that end. So to me, in addition to what is the function, I'm also interested in the attributes.\nSpeaker 3: Of the economic development organization. And when it comes to opening the doors that you need to be have opened when it comes to perhaps closing the deals that you need to have closed. I think the prospects of an economic development as force, the mayor's task force, or even these ad hoc committees that we've had, like the LA\nSpeaker 3: Biennale or maybe the the the America's Cup. I think the attributes are most suited to moving quickly to get things done. Okay. So the question then becomes, okay, well, whatever, whatever happened to the function of planning and monitoring?\nSpeaker 3: I think having as a city move forward with the economic development strategy of 1999 2000, having updated that subsequently 2008 and then and then with the prospects of updating it even more, I think that serves the framework for to make sure that whatever task force or whatever ad hoc committees that we have, that they don't operate in\nSpeaker 3: a vacuum. And there could be other ways to to ensure that that whatever Ido we come up with, hopefully, is a one that acts nimbly and quickly and closes deals, that there are other ways to make sure that they are not operating in a vacuum.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm still I'm still fine with a recommendation from 2013, and I see that mainly as expressed in the staff's recommendation tonight. It's a different way of doing economic development in Alameda and what we've been doing since I'm a mayor with the start of the Economic Development Commission, perhaps in 1990 or 1992, I can't quite remember.\nSpeaker 3: And I think we're at a point now where we've got the key players and. I do believe we have to choose one or the other. I don't think we can have both. I don't think we can have the Economic Development Commission along the lines that we had in the 1990 and early 2000 and a task force, because\nSpeaker 3: I think that that runs the risk of sort of sending mixed messages. I think that's the last thing you want to do. If I had to make a choice, I'd say it's a new century. We need to act nimbly.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm going to go with the staff's recommendation with regard to the mayor's task force and and if necessary, the ad hoc committee approach.\nSpeaker 0: So I appreciate all the comments. And I want to share, first of all, that this started back in 2013 before I was mayor. The prior council disbanded the commission and came up with this approach that staff continues to support.\nSpeaker 0: And we have had some amazing businesses come here during that time. I personally would like to give them the opportunity to continue their work. And when you speak, when staff speaks to why they think they need this, they want to be more flexible than a commission.\nSpeaker 0: So we're all here tonight. I go to meetings from a lot of commissions regularly. I do not expect business people to come and hang out here and think that that is the same goal that's going to support the business community.\nSpeaker 0: Now, I know we do have some businessmen and women that are here this evening, and thank you. But in regards to a commission coming up here and speaking publicly about what vision they may have or policies, I don't think that's what staff is asking for.\nSpeaker 0: I think staff is asking for business people that that that they can call on quickly, that they can ask for their expertize and not set a meeting, not go through the sunshine. Now, staff did say that they would formally consider meetings 1 to 2 times a year and maybe it would be a quarterly or something.\nSpeaker 0: I'm not sure. And staff is asking to be able to come back and be more clear about really what they're looking for. But I see this as member day, August 9th, who's been part of this much longer than I have.\nSpeaker 0: What he. But what the difference really is. And I would like to share that it's now a problem. I started meeting with staff on this in early January, and we do have some business people that are ready to step up and we continue to.\nSpeaker 0: Be waiting. And I think that's unfortunate. I think there are deals out there where we could use their expertize now. I think it is important to go ahead with staff's recommendation that they've been asking for apparently actually since 2000, the end of 2013.\nSpeaker 0: But but but I think. I would agree also with j soc in regards to member de sog in regards to you can't really have one. You can't have both. But I think staff is speaking about having formal, formal meetings.\nSpeaker 0: That's what we heard at least once or twice a year. And they have an idea of what they're looking for. CEO types, high level. I live a high level business people and they have specific things that they want these people to help them with.\nSpeaker 0: For instance, closing a deal that's you are not going to close the deal at a commission meeting. We know that that's not going to happen. It's not going to happen up here at a commission meeting. It will happen when staff has the flexibility that they're asking for to call certain people and have them.\nSpeaker 0: Assist. And that's what I see this as AM and that's why it needs to be flexible and a staff needs is thinking that they need that type of support to close a deal. I want to be able to support them.\nSpeaker 0: I don't want them to have to set a meeting 45 days down or 30 days down and do it publicly. Not going to happen. You're not going to close the deal at a public meeting. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: It's a clarifying question for staff. Maybe, Mr. Doan, what's to keep you from doing any of the things that are proposed now on your own? Gathering representatives of different sectors to help you or with their specific sector to help you close the deal.\nSpeaker 5: On bringing a new business here. Are you waiting for an ad hoc committee to advise you?\nSpeaker 8: We can we can do that now. And. You know, we have those relationships, right? We have a Rolodex. We have the ability to pick up the phone. I think there's an organizing principle, though, at play with a with an advisory panel that allows us to do that in unison with different sectors.\nSpeaker 8: A group of CEOs is sometimes better than one two. It's a quick, efficient way to sort of.\nSpeaker 7: Get.\nSpeaker 8: All that function together, you know, get a letter written, have it cosigned by seven or eight different members welcoming a business to town.\nSpeaker 5: So so who's going to be giving the direction to that group of CEOs to write that welcoming letter?\nSpeaker 8: Staff would call upon those CEOs. I don't know if it's. Giving direction per say. I mean, I think I think you you through your action, we this is how I would see this happening. We would go back to our offices and we would put together a formal proposal for you, for the council, and you would give up\nSpeaker 8: with the recommendation to Empanel said advisory panel, you know, thusly. And we would go and do that. You would give us the direction with our recommendations, hopefully taken into account on the activities that you would see the panel doing and the types of things that we would ask them to do and the mechanism for doing that.\nSpeaker 8: And we would take that directory, take that direction and essentially.\nSpeaker 5: I'm notified the hours getting late. So my brain is probably getting a little fuzzy here. But let me ask it a different way. What is it that you're not able to do now that you think you'd be able to do if you had either an ad hoc committee or an economic development commission?\nSpeaker 8: I think it's the. I think having the. In some ways, nothing. In some ways, though, there's a lot of value in the formality of an actual panel that's been formed by the council that we can call on quickly and efficiently to do what in some ways staff can do now is just it would take us longer and\nSpeaker 8: . You know, having the sort of weight and the punch of an actual advisory panel, as opposed to me just calling a CEO and asking them to pitch in. They will. I think there's a lot of value and weight and having that punch of a formal body.\nSpeaker 0: Member J soc.\nSpeaker 5: But I'd like to hear of my colleague.\nSpeaker 3: Well, I think that the power of a task force would first and foremost come in the form of a letter issue of business or a corporation, perhaps, that we're trying to attract. Mm hmm. And on that letterhead, it said.\nSpeaker 3: Don Stevenson from Oakland Raiders. Erika Johnson from East Coffee. Joe Blow from Abbott. Whatever. And then I went from. McCartney's last Google one from Wind River slash intel. I think it's had and then in fact it and with the letter signed frankly by the mayor of Alameda.\nSpeaker 3: I think a letter like that, I'm coming from a house. That's what we mean by being able to respond quickly to opportunities and to kind of project that, so to speak, power. In ways that, quite frankly, an economic development commission could never do.\nSpeaker 3: So that would be one. That's what we mean by Nimble.\nSpeaker 8: That's what I envision.\nSpeaker 0: And I'd like to share. We currently do send out letters that I signed to businesses welcoming them. But it doesn't have the names of CEOs like that. That would be much more impressive. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I think that's fine. And that when you talk about deal closing, no deal that involves the cities can be closed without coming to the council. First of all.\nSpeaker 3: I think we meant that.\nSpeaker 2: And I think we need to be precise here. And what you describe, I think there is a lot of weight by having a a blue ribbon committee or an ad hoc group of CEOs who want to be part of that push.\nSpeaker 2: But I'm looking more at the what we're going to do, not how we're going to do it and the what we're going to do. I don't want a committee of just CEOs defining recommendations to come to Council on Economic Development.\nSpeaker 3: That's not their task.\nSpeaker 2: And I see that as an economic development commission task. Is that that policy? Is built on what we've done in the past and what we've updated here. And I think to have that done in the in the clear light and sometimes messiness of a of a of a chambers in front of commission is very valuable.\nSpeaker 2: And I think we can also answer some tough questions that we may have to look at. The real value of land at Alameda point is one is a question I think we need to challenge whether or not the fiscal neutrality policy that was put in place when the BRAC first started happening is really valid today, I think\nSpeaker 2: is another one. I'd like I'd like to see us explore the whole question we dealt with in the past. Big box are no big box here that came out of the Economic Development Commission, hard work that they did in engaging with the community to get a community take on an economic policy.\nSpeaker 2: The two bills that came from Sacramento last year, those infrastructure bond bills. Once a Senate bill. Once the Assembly bill. Trying to address closed military bases. Whether or not we should pull the trigger on that as an economic development tool can be studied by a commission.\nSpeaker 2: With the assistance of staff, with the research of staff and an a recommendation come council. That's what I'm looking for. And again, I'm looking for accountability. I'm looking for traceability. So we understand when decisions were made, how they were made and what the what the circumstances that led to that recommendation were by virtue of of minutes of\nSpeaker 2: these. I think it can be nimble and I think it can be directed if the council takes the lead and gives good direction on what those priorities are and. Those priorities can be informed again by. Say the the updating of strategic plan.\nSpeaker 2: That's a perfect, I think, a perfect task for a commission that's made up of a a defined but a broader section of. Of people as, as we've done in other commissions. Yeah, that's, that was my goal in bringing this forward.\nSpeaker 0: Member data.\nSpeaker 3: Just to quickly summarize now, my view of the economic development organization in terms of functions. To me, the issues are broadly stated one of planning what are your goals? What are your visions? What are your objectives? When I'm planning, monitoring, are you doing it?\nSpeaker 3: And then finally implementation. My feeling is that our emphasis should be on implementation. But to the extent that planning and monitoring and planning mostly is an issue, I mean, one way that you can deal with that separately from all this is I have an economic development task force who helps put together our updated economic development strategy.\nSpeaker 3: And then whether that task force, you know, goes on to continue as a commission. I don't know. But there are different ways we can plan and make sure that we're looking at the right vision, the right tasks, that the economic development ask for the mayor's task force or or an ad hoc committee if they're not working in\nSpeaker 3: a vacuum.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Donat, you want to respond to any of these comments?\nSpeaker 4: I'm fine. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Any other council comments?\nSpeaker 2: What I believe in this I'm going to move that we direct staff to. Although the parameters of the Council referral that I submitted and reform an economic development commission that includes the elements that were presented in our report and parameters for providing council direction on the tasks.\nSpeaker 6: I'll second that.\nSpeaker 0: Any discussion. All those in favor. I oppose.\nSpeaker 3: I oppose.\nSpeaker 0: I suppose.\nSpeaker 5: I abstain?\nSpeaker 0: So at this point, it doesn't pass it. It fails.\nSpeaker 3: Well, then. So let's make a motion.\nSpeaker 0: But to make.\nSpeaker 3: A motion that I'd like to make is I would like to move staff's recommendation regarding the audit right there on page 22 of 23.\nSpeaker 0: We have a second. Second. Any discussion. So I'll discussion if. We can continue what we're doing then and have stuff. You're waiting for council to make a decision, which is, you know what? That would be my concern. I would hope that we can support staff so that we can proceed.\nSpeaker 0: And and honestly, if it doesn't work, we can always try again. I mean, this is what happened in 2013. The commission was disbanded. The decision was made to proceed with this committee. The committee was not seated. And since I've been mayor, staff has been ready to sit this committee and move forward.\nSpeaker 0: But in reality, if it doesn't work out and council always gets to weigh in and I would hope that we can work with staff so that we can start moving. So I would second the motion. I'm yes member Odie.\nSpeaker 6: I still have concerns on how this commission is composed and. Know how somebody gets on there, whether that's just by appointment, by my staff, putting them on there, by the mayor putting him on there. I mean, the council not having any input in who these the members of this.\nSpeaker 6: What do we call this economic advisory.\nSpeaker 0: Panel member de SAC.\nSpeaker 3: On page 22 of 23 with a recommendation. If staff concurs, staff will return to council or more recommendation on the membership format of the mayor's economic table.\nSpeaker 6: But that wasn't in the staff report. That was in the in the presentation. So.\nSpeaker 0: So did you want staff to address your question?\nSpeaker 6: Was that part of the is part of the motion to. Clarify that or.\nSpeaker 3: My motion to it was on page 22 of the M.\nSpeaker 6: EDT presentation of.\nSpeaker 3: The.\nSpeaker 6: I don't need any more clarification. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Or any other member comments.\nSpeaker 2: The comment I, I don't think this provides the visibility or the, the proper stage for setting policy and tackling some of the. The harder economic questions that are going to come at us.\nSpeaker 0: All right. I'm going to go ahead and call the question. All those in favor. I.\nSpeaker 5: And I'm abstaining again. And I'm going to explain why. It's something I rarely do, but I am troubled by aspects of both proposals. I feel that we may just be adding another layer of bureaucracy to what a fairly clean department is already doing.\nSpeaker 5: I think there's.\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry at this point. That was supposed to happen during discussion. So the question isn't, well, yes, you don't explain your votes afterwards. However, I thought what she was doing was trying to move this ahead because it failed again.\nSpeaker 6: We started voting on it though.\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry we started off, but I heard we had.\nSpeaker 6: Heard the other.\nSpeaker 0: One favor. I didn't finish the vote. Oh, okay. I just heard that. But it was 2 to 2 and I'm sorry. No, we haven't finished the vote.\nSpeaker 5: Well, it is going to be to to to again.\nSpeaker 0: So let me finish calling the question, please. All those opposed.\nSpeaker 6: No, no.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So that was two in favor. One abstention and to oppose. So at this point, I'd like to proceed with the next agenda item. So it's almost. We actually have two more items.\nSpeaker 2: In a preventive preemptive motion.\nSpeaker 1: No. 11.\nSpeaker 5: 11.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: 60 Recommendation to accept an informational report on establishing integrated waste collection ceiling rates and service fees for Alameda County Industries for rate period 14th July 2015 to June 2016.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 6: Thank you. Let's take item number 27 now.\nSpeaker 1: Report from City Manager Recommendation to receive a presentation on the proposed Long Beach Safety Recovery Plan. Provide input in policy direction and approve the plan to address the public safety impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic, utilizing available federal relief funding and to allocate fiscal year 2021 the expenditure of up to $5 million to implement the proposed plan\nSpeaker 1: citywide.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Let's hear that presentation.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much, Vice Mayor, members of the council, we heard very clearly from this council earlier this year that we were expecting to dedicate additional resources towards what we call our safety recovery plan. We have that plan ready and in front of you tonight as a proposed plan for your consideration.\nSpeaker 7: Assistant City Manager Linda Tatum will take us through the presentation and the different buckets. And it's important to remember that while we're proposing some additional safety resources, that's coupled with what's in the Recovery Act already, which was really focused heavily on longer term violence prevention.\nSpeaker 7: So we're going to cover that as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda to walk us through the presentation.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Tom. We'll get started and we'll try to keep this fairly brief, as all of you are aware, since the start of the pandemic back in 20. Like many other cities, the city of Long Beach has had a significant increase in violent crime, especially crime around gun violence.\nSpeaker 8: This is a national issue, not just a local Long Beach issue. And it stems from economic distress, unemployment and societal stresses due to the pandemic. Gun sales have increased nationally. They're up nationally. Long Beach Police Department firearm seizures are up, as well as firearm assaults.\nSpeaker 8: In Long Beach. They are up 60% compared to 2020. And a call to action. Last month, the city council requested that the city manager work with our police department to develop a plan to address these increased levels of violent crime.\nSpeaker 8: The police department began their work in 2020 and they focused on a number of strategies to reduce violent crime. And I'll just highlight those here. They are neighborhoods and partnerships with community based nonprofits, organizations in the community. They are very focused on data driven approaches to allocating their over time and resources to address crime.\nSpeaker 8: They're also they rolled out this year a pilot program on a community or a coordinated response team, and they are committed to the implementation of policies, procedures and through the implementation of the Office of Constitutional Policing, which is a new component of the police department.\nSpeaker 8: The city manager worked with the police department and has is proposing this safety recovery plan that includes investments in additional policing measures and additional violence prevention work that was approved through the Long Beach Recovery Act that was approved by the council earlier this year.\nSpeaker 8: This plan allocates $5 million in one time general fund dollars, and these programs are led essentially by city staff. But they really do rely on those community partnerships with nonprofits and community organizations to implement specific components of these plans.\nSpeaker 8: So the funding will go not only to the to the city staff, but also to some of those organizations that will be assisting city staff in these efforts. This investment includes, as I said before, $5 million for violence prevention.\nSpeaker 8: And that is in addition to the $3.6 million that the city council approved through the Long Beach Recovery Act program earlier this year. And when you combine the 5 million with the 3.6 million, that's a total of $8.63 million that will be focused in our community to address violent crime.\nSpeaker 8: But also importantly, it will address violence prevention. And again, I will note that that funding goes to not just the city staff and that the various programs, but it will it includes components that rely upon funding for community based organizations as partners in these efforts.\nSpeaker 8: I'll walk you through some of the programs. These are all highlighted in the staff report, but I'd like to just talk about these. And these are the the new or continued programs that are proposed in the community in the safety recovery plan.\nSpeaker 8: The first of these is the coordinated response team, and this is funding both sworn and non sworn PD staff. They will investigate firearm incidents using crime analysis and intelligence techniques, and that's a $1.7 million. There's also what we call calls for service.\nSpeaker 8: That's fundamentally enhancing base staff staffing levels in the police department. This program supports reductions that occurred from last year's budget reductions in the police department. And it essentially is designed to maintain existing beat and deployment levels among the officers in the police department.\nSpeaker 8: And that the the focus here is to maintain response time so that they do not degrade from last year's response time. This is really critical to instill public trust and confidence and making sure that there is a public safety response as crime increases.\nSpeaker 8: There's also the Neighborhood Walks program. This is a new pilot program that started in 2021 with the objective of increasing outreach and community engagement with residents, businesses and community based organizations. It's the police officers actually walking in the community and engaging in direct engagement with residents and businesses.\nSpeaker 8: There is also the Neighborhood Safe Streets initiatives. This is very similar to the the Neighborhood Walks program where the the officers are on bicycles and it gives them a lot more flexibility to make direct contacts. However, the focus on the the bike program is its focus on the city's entertainment districts, the waterfront and the tourist areas and\nSpeaker 8: other areas that have been impacted by crime. We also have as a part of this program, a program that's called the Active Bystander for Law Enforcement, or the acronym is able. It's this funding is a match of a federal grant that the police department has received to support this this pilot program.\nSpeaker 8: It's an initiative that aims to prevent officer misconduct, police mistakes, and to promote general officer health and wellness. We also have the entertainment and business district program. This likewise will support staffing levels and respond to the increased calls for service in the city's entertainment districts and in the business districts.\nSpeaker 8: This will address an increase in some of the kinds of activities that have been occurring in those areas, such as fights, vandalism and other disorderly conduct by individuals, including individuals that are unhoused. The next program is the Community Youth Engagement.\nSpeaker 8: This includes a city team working with community based organizations and again, funding those collaborations with those community based organizations. And it really is a very it's a rich program where the city teams they they coordinate with to to offer programs such as Midnight Basketball Playground Partners and what they call summer night type programs in partnership with those\nSpeaker 8: local community based organizations. And this program, the funding covers officers overtime pay to participate in these programs like the Bicycle Program and the Community the WALKS Program. These programs are really all about relationship building by allowing the police officers to interact directly with residents.\nSpeaker 8: And in this program, the last program is the gun buyback program. And this was a council directed program last month that council approved. And this will involve a buyback event that's coordinated by a police department. And I'd like.\nSpeaker 8: I'd like to transition and briefly cover the the other programs that are really aimed at the the upstream to violence to prevent violence before it occurs. So I'll briefly walk through these programs. The first of these is the Be Safe program.\nSpeaker 8: This program has been offered for the last five years by the city's Parks and Recreation Department. And the funding that's proposed here would expand this program and offer activities for children, teens and adults to enjoy to enjoy summer evening hours and additional locations.\nSpeaker 8: And they already are being provided both in central west in north Long Beach. The next program is the Safe Passage program. This is likewise a violence interruption program. And it is this program is implemented by the health department.\nSpeaker 8: And it likewise expands upon a program that's already in progress. It provides safety to our residents or youth from gang related crimes against youth and families. And it's really focused on the hotspots that have been identified in the communities to offer safe passage for for for youth in the community.\nSpeaker 8: And on the other program is the Office of Youth Development. This is a summer neighborhood engagement program. It offers our youths training in civics leadership development in partnership, again with local community based organizations who would receive funding from the city to participate in these programs.\nSpeaker 8: And I'd one of the other particular efforts of this program is the foster community or neighborhood pride in the youth, in areas such as the Washington Street neighborhood, as well as additional neighborhoods in north and west Long Beach.\nSpeaker 8: A another program is the it's called the increasing funding to to current building youth social capital grantees. Again, a, this is a partnership with some of our community based organizations. This program is already in its currently existing. It would increase funding to the eight organizations in partnership with the city's health department currently.\nSpeaker 8: This funding will expand youth engagement opportunity in these existing work programs. We also have the Teen Center Enhancement Program. Fundamentally, this program expands existing normal operating hours for 16 centers in the community, and it expands those hours from 4 to 6 hours per day.\nSpeaker 8: It also allows enhanced enriched programing at these ten teen centers for four Long Beach youth. And we also have the. It's called career exploration. Exploring Space Beach. This funding is a variety of work based learning activities that raise awareness of careers in careers and academic opportunities in space technology and engineering.\nSpeaker 8: With our local emerging space tech partners that they include Virgin Orbit, Relativity and other a new space technology firms that have located here in Long Beach. Okay. I'd like to really briefly summarize the other the remaining programs that are part of their safety recovery plan.\nSpeaker 8: And these are programs, again, that were previously funded by the council approved Long Beach Recovery Act. And there are six programs. Here are the first is youth academic programs. This funding goes to the city library to expand library services and programs for teens.\nSpeaker 8: The Youth Life Coaching and mentoring. This program by the Health Department would establish a life coaching network and mentoring for youth in impacted areas of the city. The Youth Health and safety programing. This is a collaboration of both the health department, the police department, Parks and Rec, as well as community based organizations.\nSpeaker 8: And this is a very robust variety of programs. These activities occur in city parks at night. They include midnight basketball, as these are examples, because it's a pretty robust variety of programs midnight basketball, job readiness, life skills, family and teen enrichment and wellness classes and summer lunch programs just to name a few.\nSpeaker 8: So again, a very robust program that it requires a partnership between multiple city departments as well as our community based organizations. And then we have the the Be Safe program. I talked about that program earlier. This funding through the L we are a enriched that program which is already in operation and this expands that program to give\nSpeaker 8: it a higher impact in some of the cities communities that are impacted by violence. It provides access not just to the youth, but also to provides family supportive services. We also have the reentry pilot program. This program is to provide services, reentry support for individuals coming out of an incarceration setting.\nSpeaker 8: It actually integrates and provides support for mental health services, employment and other supportive services for these individuals that are reintegrating into our community. Then we have a mental health crisis, a response pilot. This funding provides a community, a community responder team that provides responses to calls for service that do not require a police response.\nSpeaker 8: These responders are these calls are typically the lower risk calls related to mental health addiction, and they do provide a collaboration with the city's homeless response teams. So that's a summary of the programs, both those that are proposed by.\nSpeaker 8: Proposed as a part of the program. And lastly, I'd just like to acknowledge that, like the city's CARES Act program that was implemented last year and closed out this year, this program incorporates strategies from the city's equity toolkit, and the proposed safety programs will be designed and reviewed through an equity lens to ensure that they reached the\nSpeaker 8: city's hardest hit communities and those areas that have been most impacted by COVID. The fiscal impact. This authorization is requested for this current fiscal year for up to 5 million and general fund. These costs are intended anticipated to be covered as we discussed earlier under the city's approved Long Beach Recovery Act funds.\nSpeaker 8: And these funds are currently set aside to cover budget shortfalls and to replenish the reserves for FY 21 and 22. And lastly, all of these funds are one time request and they do not involve any structural enhancements. In closing, I'd like to conclude with the recommendation that the City Council consider the proposed plan, provide input and policy\nSpeaker 8: direction, and also improve the plan and its priorities to address public safety impacts that the city is is experiencing due to the COVID 19 pandemic. And the final recommendation is to authorize the city manager to allocate, in this current fiscal year 21, the expenditure of up to $5 million in general fund group to implement this proposed safety\nSpeaker 8: recovery plan. That concludes the staff recommendation.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Linda, for that presentation. I know we have a number of people have been waiting for public comment. We're going to go to public comment first on this item, Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 1: Well, the first five speakers line up when I call your name, Robert Castillo. Manuela Almaguer. Kenny Green. Alfredo Gomez. And David McGill Soriano.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, council members. My name is Robert Castiel. I am the program manager for for work force department at Central Community Hispanic Association. Also more popular and popularly known as CHA. I specifically work with the reentry population at Central CHA.\nSpeaker 6: I work with a program that's funded by the Board of Border State of Corrections Community. We help individuals that are returning from prison back to their communities. I also oversee the staff that works with the with funding from the Department of Labor.\nSpeaker 6: They work with youth that are that have been there. They're justice involved. And, you know, so that's what I do, the central. I think that we do a very good job there. I want to believe that a lot of our success has to do with because we're culturally relevant.\nSpeaker 6: You know, some of my past experiences and my journey have helped me to help others. But besides just my life experience and things that I've gone through in my life, I also have an education. I have two master's degrees.\nSpeaker 6: I studied or earned my master's degrees that are future specific. I have one in theology also of a master's degree in psychology. So, you know, I look the way I look, but I consider myself a very educated person.\nSpeaker 6: And it has it has allowed me to just be real effective in working with the population that I work with.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Love, to you. Your time is up.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next beaker, please. Good evening, city council members of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: My name is Manuel McGarry. I'm a constituent of the sixth District. I've been a Long Beach resident for all my life. I am a product of the.\nSpeaker 1: Educational system here. I attended Woodrow Wilson High School as well as State Long Beach.\nSpeaker 4: And most.\nSpeaker 2: Importantly, am talking about identity. I am an older sister to four siblings and also the main breadwinner in my mixed immigration household.\nSpeaker 4: I remember being the age of 16.\nSpeaker 1: Excited to start my paid internship program at Central Chop. It was an opportunity to.\nSpeaker 2: Develop my workforce skills, but also more importantly, to put food on the table for my family.\nSpeaker 1: Seven years later, I've been given the privilege to work for the organization that has helped me navigate the.\nSpeaker 4: Educational system.\nSpeaker 1: And also shaped me into the person I am today.\nSpeaker 4: Working there, many.\nSpeaker 1: Of the participants I serve either have faced or have faced where situations and I have.\nSpeaker 4: Many of their challenges are brought up by gang violence.\nSpeaker 1: The justice system.\nSpeaker 4: Poverty and since.\nSpeaker 1: The pandemic have also been dealing.\nSpeaker 2: With mental health issues and homelessness.\nSpeaker 4: So it's important for the city to find existing community.\nSpeaker 2: Organizations where the change will happen.\nSpeaker 1: And continue to positively impact the.\nSpeaker 2: Lives of our community members. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good afternoon or good evening. My name is Kitty Greenhouse Work at Central Trial. Prior to me working at Central, I had 25 years experience working with gang intervention and working with the DISENFRANCHIZED. And that taught me a lot about how much that population have really dictates the quality of life in our communities\nSpeaker 6: . You know, as I look at your at the $5 million proposed proposal, you know, I hear, you know, it's law enforcement working with CDOs. But when you look at look at it's it's the 5 million is 85% law enforcement, 5% CDOs.\nSpeaker 6: And that's that's really misleading because, you know, we have CDOs like Central Cha, where I work for has a track record of public safety. They have a track record of dealing with justice impacted folks and getting those like those violent people, those people in and out of the penitentiaries.\nSpeaker 6: And it's a menace in our society to heal them. So they don't so our our community can heal and thrive. So we need to look at and I heard the second part, there is a little bit of money in reentry.\nSpeaker 6: But again, you know, it's not enough money. And if we're going to be community partners, you know, I think that the funding should, you know, be a little more. Equal because everybody that's into, you know, the work that we do, we have a track record of public safety.\nSpeaker 6: You know, so I know my time's up, but thank you. Thank you for your time. Next speaker, please. Hello. Good afternoon. My name is Alfredo Gomez. I made a long life, long life resident at West Long Beach, just as some of my colleagues were saying.\nSpeaker 6: I'm from central China as well. I started off as a youth. I was referred by the. By the department of actually the department were.\nSpeaker 5: I actually. I'm sorry. I was referred to.\nSpeaker 6: There by the. But the Department of Probation.\nSpeaker 5: As a youth and.\nSpeaker 6: As a product of that, actually gained a lot of knowledge and information to where I didn't know how to go about my life. I actually gained the knowledge to gain a job, to gain employment, a career. I didn't know how to hold a hammer when I was a teenager.\nSpeaker 6: I wasn't you know, I wasn't taught that this place actually gave me somewhere to be instead of being on the street and causing havoc. This place gave me a license. They gave me a refinery safety overview, which I learned in my first job at the refinery, and I was able to provide for my family opposed to being\nSpeaker 6: on the street. So community based organizations like this need to see more of the funding to make sure that this product doesn't go to waste and it actually becomes a servant of the society. And I'm just trying to give back.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. All right, next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Hey, this is David.\nSpeaker 6: I live in the Washington neighborhood.\nSpeaker 5: And honestly, I wish I had to be here. I was home watching the NBA Finals with the Bucks and Suns. The bucks just took that.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, unfortunately.\nSpeaker 5: But this is. This is not it. When I'm looking at this budget, we're not investing enough into our local youth. We're not investing enough into violence prevention or really works.\nSpeaker 6: I'm a Washington neighborhood youth. I'm a Washington neighborhood emerging adult. Ah, our youth are crying for help. Our young men specifically are crying for help in that neighborhood, and we need to actually start supporting them. You know, the Neighborhood.\nSpeaker 5: Walks program that's getting a lot of funding. And since that has been implemented, there's been so much crime since then. Rafael, 22.\nSpeaker 6: Was killed while you sitting.\nSpeaker 5: In his car right there on 15th and cedar seatbelts. There are movies in the park, Seaside Park, while they were watching a movie. Right. The Last Dragon. So there's a shooting Anaheim in Cedar.\nSpeaker 6: And the families have to watch the movie with the helicopter going around Seaside Park with their lights. Beam can't even hear the movie anymore.\nSpeaker 5: These families deal with violence day to day. You just live in this neighborhood like Washington, Erin and others, just for now. You actually see where it's at. And we need to start solving the.\nSpeaker 6: Problems in our community because we're not we need to start bringing.\nSpeaker 5: Solutions and into our most hit areas.\nSpeaker 6: In an equitable manner. When you start listen up to our youth and asking them what they they most want now, just telling them what they need. Start investing in violence prevention in our youth and put in these funds into our youth so they can be empowered and lead us forward.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. The next five speakers Abraham Zavala, Franklyn Simms, Jordan Wynn, Jesse Johnson Jr and Leonard Adams Jr. Please line up. Abraham Zavala, Franklin Sims Jordan. When Jesse Johnson Jr. And Leonard Adams Jr. Is Abraham here?\nSpeaker 6: Mr. Jordan. Europe. All right. Just checking around. Yeah. Thank you. Jordan wins second district.\nSpeaker 5: I am deeply moved.\nSpeaker 7: By the testimony that has been given so.\nSpeaker 6: Far as I hope you are as well.\nSpeaker 7: Diversion and reentry programs change lives.\nSpeaker 6: Investing in our youth substantially changes lives. And it breaks my heart when I see these presentations.\nSpeaker 5: And I see easily.\nSpeaker 7: Two $3 million thrown to police infrastructure, and I see $60,000, $35,000 to youth programs and prevention. It's not fair. That's not how we should be investing, especially after a year. I'm not convinced.\nSpeaker 5: That the police needs this money. You're telling me that crimes involving firearms have increased 60% compared to last year, 2020 a year when almost all people, everyone stayed constantly isolated inside their homes. That doesn't surprise me.\nSpeaker 7: Crime is still down compared to where we were ten years ago.\nSpeaker 6: Even five years ago, even three years ago. And we can't use.\nSpeaker 5: That as a justification to go back.\nSpeaker 7: On our promise to commit to our communities. When we're thinking about crime intervention, we're thinking about prevention. That's where we have to jump in. We're not jumping in afterwards.\nSpeaker 5: In fact, the police in Miami does not have a good track record after the fact when it comes to crimes. Three in five violent crimes in Miami, two remain unsolved.\nSpeaker 6: We think of Fred Taft, say his name. Fred Taft.\nSpeaker 5: Who's murdered by hate crime, still remains unsolved. And so many more families.\nSpeaker 7: That do not get justice. Even more shocking, in.\nSpeaker 5: 2020, only 9.1%.\nSpeaker 7: Of all property crimes were cleared. That Martin Luther King Jr. Statue desecration. There's an over 90% chance that that won't be cleared at all. We need to invest in our communities and stop investing in things that don't work.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Jesse Johnson. I'm the founder of the 100 Men of Long Beach, as well as the past advisory board member of Midnight Basketball. I want to commend the city council and the chief of police for a successful position.\nSpeaker 6: That was a successful program we had in the past. Midnight Basketball basically is a program where we assist and with youth by providing meaningful workshops to empower them and then let them play basketball close to midnight. It's been so successful.\nSpeaker 6: And thanks to both Mayor Doris Type-C our board and chess ancestrally Walter that we it started here and not about 1995 and there's actually 26 leagues throughout the nation and there's one in London. So again, thank you for this consideration.\nSpeaker 6: And this program is, again, well needed because it's a fact that when that program was not in existence, crime went up in the area. So, again, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Next speaker, please. Good afternoon, City Council Honorable Rex Richardson and all of the council staff.\nSpeaker 6: My name is Leonard Adams. I am from the sixth district of Long Beach. I am also the ex coordinator for Midnight Basketball. I was in charge of the program for 13 years. So if you heard anything about midnight basketball more likely?\nSpeaker 6: I was a part of it. So midnight basketball actually started in another city. It started in the city. Maryland, Glenn Arden, Maryland. It was started up by a city manager. His name was G. Van Standard Sanford. It was started because he started to notice between the hours of 8:00 and 2:00, there was a lot of crime, a\nSpeaker 6: lot of shootings that are break ins, residential burglaries. So he figured out a way how to get those those population of people to be in one spot at one time. So he started by going around town looking for empty buildings.\nSpeaker 6: And he found one and he installed some some basketball goals in it. And he invited kids in it. He let them play, just basically have free play. And later on, he developed a program called Midnight Basketball, which we had for 13 years here in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: The crime went down about 60%, according to public records. Glenn Arden, Maryland. The program also was implemented by President George W Bush, not George W, but George H. Bush in 1990. He earned the honor grandstand for it and also call it 124 points of life.\nSpeaker 6: So if the city is willing to take a chance on our today's youth, I believe that midnight basketball is the perfect tool to have in our community to come back crime and to drive down the violence that has been occurring for the last year and a half.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you very much for coming next. Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: To be polite. This plan stinks like a porta potty and it's full of bad ideas and no toilet paper and only five months. This plan spends nearly $2 million on police salaries and overtime for just one investigation team.\nSpeaker 5: In fact, 92% of the plans $5 million will fund police salaries and overtime. Under this plan, police will get another almost half million dollars of even more overtime to walk the Washington neighborhood. But the city manager said that with 186 overtime hours, the police made only 300 contacts in Washington.\nSpeaker 5: That's one community member every 37 minutes. Steve Urkel could make more friends in 37 minutes. And it's a sad commentary when meeting neighbors requires overtime in a pilot program instead of simply being a part of your job. And then there are the bifocals.\nSpeaker 5: The city manager admits that an additional half million for bicycle cop is perfect for a waterfront business and entertainment districts. Well, that's just perfect because Mary, Sue, Lee, Roberto and Rex have beautiful waterfront and business entertainment districts. Ideal for bicycle camps.\nSpeaker 5: And when I'm done, the city manager will tell you there is a recovery plan for next year. Has plenty of work missing this year. It's not true. Most of next year's money goes to parks and library programs. We hardly have enough parks in the neighborhoods where the shootings are popping up and the library programs are great for\nSpeaker 5: kids, but they don't work for teens. Choosing between schools and gave one three, five, seven, nine. And the mayor, you're up for reelection. And this is the issue on everyone's mind.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Simms.\nSpeaker 5: Are my kids safe? Am I safe? And the answer is, hell, no.\nSpeaker 1: The next five speakers Melissa morgan, Dr. Kim Tiberi, Adrianna Redmond, Jessie Johnson and Caroline Hines. Speakers. Can you please line up? Melissa morgan. Dr. Kim Tiwari. Adrianna Redman, Jesse Johnson and Caroline Hines.\nSpeaker 6: I think we already had Jesse. I don't see Doctor the bar here. I think we just have Melissa and Audrina and Carolyn.\nSpeaker 4: All right, 90 seconds. Remember these numbers, one 814 zero one. We have one person here, a guy from Washington neighborhood. He's our hope. He's our future. He's and we're fighting for and why we're showing up and staying late and missing our kids for dinner.\nSpeaker 4: One eight $8 million. You're squeezing into the police department's budget for fiscal year 21. Do not pass this program. Come on, you guys. Come on. Last year, you hear this? There are people in the street saying defund the police.\nSpeaker 4: What does that mean? Divest, invest, shift your money. Here's a gift thinking caps for each of you to think creatively outside of punitive work. I worked with Chief Luna in the past 15 years ago doing youth and gang violence prevention.\nSpeaker 4: This has not worked. Using police and using punitive measures does not work. We heard from that one gang. You're telling us you're giving police 8 million more dollars, 14. You want to increase the police budget by $14 million?\nSpeaker 4: That's two more health departments. We're saying get money to the health department, give money to Centro to give money to what works. We know what works here. Some sounds slick, slimy, slimy, sleazy, slightly sickening soap opera. That's what this police department's budget looks like.\nSpeaker 4: You're asking for money at the last minute, squeezing it in. The community has the answers. You hear us coming here? We're passionate. We can come to a principle for a day to have Washington. I live in Washington for a day.\nSpeaker 4: See what happens. Council members see what life is like on the other side.\nSpeaker 6: If you make speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Audrina Redmon.\nSpeaker 5: Resident of District two, BLM and the People's Party Coalition. I'm going to put this here because this says defund the police. This was a cry, a mantra. It is a call for an opportunity for the city to invest in something other than failed policies like the Long Beach Police Department.\nSpeaker 5: Specifically, I want to point out and reiterate what other people have said. But I am struck by two things. A couple of things, actually, Abel, which is the active bystander law for law enforcement. Now, why in the hell do we need something like that?\nSpeaker 5: Isn't that supposed to be a part of their training already? You're supposed to be able to to. To do policing, right? And to stop your fellow officer when they're murdering people and abusing people, which our city has a very strong record on.\nSpeaker 5: I'm ashamed that something like this has to be put into our budget. I'm ashamed that we have. What is this? The notion of an office of Constitutional Policing. I remember when Chief Luna came in and I went to a couple of his introductory meetings to the community, and I heard him talking about constitutional policing.\nSpeaker 5: It sounds like some more B.S. for police funding. There's plenty of money for the policing in our budget, existing 44% or more of our city's budget. We think that 25% of that ought to be taken away from the police department and reinvested into things the community really needs, reinvested into the hopes and and the direction expressed by\nSpeaker 5: David from the Washington neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: That's Redmond. Your time is up. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: I'm still talking the general fund. This is a guy's is $5 million additional money for the where the police department is is a ruse. It's all a ruse just to give them more money. It is not addressing any of the things the community talked to you about when you got down to those items in the in the\nSpeaker 5: in your budget. It was shameful is shameful how little you really care about the things the community was calling for and you're still doing what you've always done, which is hiding behind criminalizing people, which is hiding behind looking at folks as if they are are wanting to exist in the way that they are.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I appreciate you. I think we get the point. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. My name is Carolyn Christian.\nSpeaker 9: Hines and I reside in the.\nSpeaker 5: Awesome and amazing District One with the leadership of the unstoppable and incredible memories and day House. As my council member.\nSpeaker 9: I am here tonight because I am a alumni of leadership, Long.\nSpeaker 5: Beach and as many of my colleagues are here as well. And why are things that we learned about as soon as we completed the process we had to serve. And my first service was with the midnight basketball camp and program.\nSpeaker 9: We were able to bring in young men who are not all.\nSpeaker 5: Justice involved, not all gang affiliated, but many of them did have needs. They were either service suffering from homelessness or food insecurity. And so the finding we need I'm going to ask I'm going straight for the ask.\nSpeaker 4: We needed to.\nSpeaker 5: Provide the program to deliver it to the participants. Midnight Basketball was an amazing program like Leonard already mentioned, but in Long Beach, it was rewarding. It was. It was inspiring and it was definitely effective. My background, I work in Juvenile Justice Coordinating Council in the County of Los Angeles.\nSpeaker 5: I'm a grip and gang reduction and intervention professional facilitator. I also work with the L.A. Regional Reentry Program, and I started out with the Long Beach Bars program with Operation Shortstop. So our background is to get them in the game, play the game, and then we do workshops.\nSpeaker 5: So I want you to just know two things. One, we need the money. Two, We are productive and it works. So if you want gang intervention and prevention crime to drop this, we need funding for money for the program.\nSpeaker 5: Some of them just can't they can't even play because they're hungry. So thank you for your time. Thank you, council members and thank you for the money.\nSpeaker 4: I'm asking the Libyans.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. All right. So now we'll take the conversation back behind the rail, the making the motion. Councilwoman Allen, your comments.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you, Linda, for the presentation. And also thanks to all the folks that make comments tonight. Leonard, I love the midnight basketball idea. And I also want to thank all of our officers who have gone above and beyond in these challenging times.\nSpeaker 1: And and I appreciate you. Our business districts are finally seeing visitor numbers increase and tourism return. They need all of our support to keep their customers feeling safe and secure and to protect their businesses and properties. With firearm assaults up, prohibited possessors out and about, and increased calls for police services and our business corridors and neighborhoods across\nSpeaker 1: the city. We needed to respond to these serious issues. I will not list all the programs that will be funded. They are in the report, but a few of my priorities will continue to be community policing, entertainment and business district policing, ensuring adequate adequate base staffing levels and proactively targeting prohibited possessors.\nSpeaker 1: Youth engagement. And. Violence, violence prevention and in all of its forms. The amazing funding that we're getting from the American Rescue Plan gives us an opportunity to support violence prevention programs and early intervention. I believe we must tackle current crime and implement structural programs to reduce future cycles of crime and violence.\nSpeaker 1: The plan. This plan takes an important step towards both of those goals. So thank you, Chief. Thank you, city manager, for your hard work. I will be supporting this item. And Chief, I do have a multipart question for you.\nSpeaker 1: So can you please describe the reductions in staffing that took place last year in our entertainment and business districts? And and also can you walk us through what additional staffing like bike officers and targeted district staffing might look like?\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, Mr. Vice Mayor and members of the City Council. Thank you for calling me up. Obviously, this is a very complex issue. Very passionate. Glad to hear there's a lot of passion in this room about it. In regards to the last question, in regards to how the bicycles and foot patrols would be utilized.\nSpeaker 6: It's all data driven. Each of our commanders that are in charge of each division participate in dozens and dozens of community meetings where members of the community come forward and they talk about the challenges that they see in their neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 6: We listen. We deploy to those needs and where the where those needs are needed. That's where we would deploy. Regarding last year's budget, we took about a $10.3 million reduction in the police department budget. Which equated to approximately 51 sworn positions.\nSpeaker 6: And as I have come before all of you on the city council, as we're dealing with violent crime. Almost all of you were looking at all of us in city management and saying, this is unacceptable. We need to stop this.\nSpeaker 6: I agree. It's absolutely ridiculous. Our shootings are up. They were up a lot more earlier in the year. Right now, they're up approximately 56%. It's not something we're just seen here in Long Beach. We're seeing it in almost every large city in America.\nSpeaker 6: There's an epidemic of violence. President Biden talked about it several weeks ago. He talked about funding more police. But putting more police on the street is not the only solution. So those cuts have impacted our city. And this plan that we're putting forward adds additional officers on the days and the hours and the specific areas based on\nSpeaker 6: data to keep people safe. And I keep on repeating myself and saying this over and over. We've had 21 murders this year. All but one are people of color. That offends me. Just like I'm sure it offends everyone else in this room.\nSpeaker 6: And my job is to stop it. My job isn't to put people of color in jail. I do not believe in mass incarceration. My job, though, is is to stop the people who are using firearms to hurt people in our community.\nSpeaker 6: And I intend to do that and continue to do that. And I see I this is a team effort. We have the best police officers in the country.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Chief.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next, we have Councilwoman Pryce, the second year of the motion.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Chief, since you're up here. One of the issues that I've been very concerned about is the proposed changes to the air support unit last year. And I'm the one that brought the item to ask us to reevaluate the proposal for last year.\nSpeaker 2: I think the Air Support Unit is a really great resource. It's it's not a street resource. It's it's an above ground resource that has a higher a better view, better scope of what they're looking for and is very successful in crime prevention and and crime.\nSpeaker 2: Solving crime really can be. I know that the police department issued a memorandum recently in response to the item that I brought to council, but I didn't see that called out at all in the safety recovery plan. And to the extent that we're having these discussions, I would like to see the Air Support Unit continue to be\nSpeaker 2: evaluated in terms of what makes most sense, because if we have to lose patrol officers to put them in the air support unit, that's not beneficial for any of us. And so I want to make sure that that's something you don't have to talk about it.\nSpeaker 2: Now, I know that August 3rd is going to be the main public safety budget issue of presentation, but that is something that's concerning to me. The other area that I know I've talked with you about and the city manager about is the area of traffic safety.\nSpeaker 2: I'm very concerned about the number of traffic fatalities that we've had. I realize it's a different type of violent crime. And I'll tell you, every family member that I have met who's lost a loved one in a DUI collision will tell you it was a very violent offense to them and it was a very violent tragedy.\nSpeaker 2: And so I want to make sure that we're not forgetting traffic safety. Our traffic division has been reduced over the years, and that's really not allowed for a proactive outreach and education, reminder about speeding, reminders to people about the importance of not being impaired when driving a car, things of that nature.\nSpeaker 2: So I was disappointed, too, that there was no money in there for traffic as well. So those are.\nSpeaker 4: Two areas where I wish we could have.\nSpeaker 2: Contributed some more resources or allocated some more resources. I loved hearing from the audience today about some of the programs. I'm involved in several reentry programs and also diversion programs where we work with a lot of nonprofits that the the county and cities support.\nSpeaker 2: I think those programs are tremendously helpful. I think when you can walk alongside someone who is seeing things and getting support from the criminal justice system, nontraditional support partners and they succeed, that is the biggest reward ever. And to be able to work with people and get them into the trades as part of a reentry program, which\nSpeaker 2: is something I'm very involved in for folks that are coming out of prison, not jail, but but still it's so rewarding. Personally, it's so rewarding. And so I think those programs are great and I want to continue to support.\nSpeaker 2: Now we all know not all nonprofit organizations are built the same. So the foundation that an organization like center trial would have is going to be very different than maybe a newer organization. Everybody has to start somewhere. But I think those that have developed a strong foundation for rehabilitation, integration and access programs, I think we should continue\nSpeaker 2: to support them. And I'm glad to see that there is some support for those programs in the budget. I would love to see more, but of course it's always a balancing act and I look forward to hearing what my colleagues thoughts are on this topic and where that money might move around.\nSpeaker 2: But again, I, I would I would have liked to see a little bit more money for our support and traffic safety, because I think those are two very needed resources that every city should have and in the name of public safety.\nSpeaker 2: So thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. That was the motion in the seconder. I'd like to insert my comments here. I want to start with Mr. City Manager. So first of all, thank you for responding to the mayor's request. You were asked to do a public safety centered approach, largely because when we presented the recovery plan, there was no funding associated directly\nSpeaker 6: with the police department or safety. I want you to respond specifically to the claim about the funding being 80, 85% versus five or 15% for community. How would you respond to that?\nSpeaker 7: So as the assistant city manager talked about in the presentation, there are two components here. The original Recovery Act had about $3.6 million, and it was all violence prevention work. There was no public safety dollars in that. That wasn't actually an eligible use under the Recovery Act to begin with.\nSpeaker 7: That has changed and that has been changed at the federal level to also include safety type programs since that time. But when we proposed it, it was a 3.6 million there. So we heard very clearly from the council on multiple occasions about the need to address shootings and violent crime.\nSpeaker 7: And that really was our focus. So as we went back and looked at the safety recovery plan, we found the additional resources of 5 million. And so when you combine that with the Recovery Act money that was already funded, which is the longer term violence prevention, and a lot of that money is going to be going out\nSpeaker 7: to our community. When you put those two numbers side by side, it's about 53% would go towards safety programs in the police department and 47% would go towards violence prevention programs. So I think it's important to look at all of that together as a as a response plan.\nSpeaker 6: So the. What's the timeline on the violence prevention police? Do you anticipate that these all rolled out around the same time?\nSpeaker 8: Yes. Fundamentally, the a lot of the work for the Long Beach Recovery Act program rollout is underway. And we anticipate most of the programs that will fund community based support of implementation of those programs, those RFP will be going out within the next 30, 30 to 45 days.\nSpeaker 8: And all of the the various community based organizations that support the basketball programs, the reentry programs and all of those, they would be eligible to respond to the RFP and participate in those programs. In addition, though, the staff has a relationship with a lot of those organizations in the community.\nSpeaker 8: So what we do in advance of submitting the RFP is to to reach out to those individuals to make sure that they're aware that it is coming out and just make sure that they apply if they are interested in receiving that funding.\nSpeaker 7: And part of the strategy, if I can add, vice mayor, is we're dealing with shooting crises right now. So right now we know we've got programs that need to get funded, especially on the safety side that really is urgent.\nSpeaker 7: We can put those overtime dollars to use almost immediately. We can react very quickly with our own staff and some of our Be Safe program, and they're just adding more hours to people who are already on the payroll.\nSpeaker 7: Our nonprofits, we we really like working with them and supporting them. There is a competitive process we have to go through to make sure that we're allocating dollars fairly. So those do take a little bit longer and those are our longer term strategies.\nSpeaker 7: So both will happen. But there is a timing perspective on which dollars we can spend a little faster.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. So two, two things respond to that. First, I think we need to do a better job being clear about what people can expect in terms of the comprehensive approach. I think we need to lean in. I'm a big believer in violence prevention.\nSpeaker 6: Some people say it's fantastic. I know that it works upstream and downstream. So we need to talk about we need to when we present this, we need to focus on these are the things we're doing upstream. These are the community supports that we're putting in place or reinforcing.\nSpeaker 6: Here are strategies and here's where the suppression comes in. Here's where the Neighborhood Safe Streets program comes in. Here's how we're addressing this. And I think the responsibility is on us as the city to take that additional step and explain that to folks.\nSpeaker 6: I really want to see more of that moving forward. The second thing I would say is I want to thank all the speakers here, particularly the young man from the Washington neighborhood. I thought he had a very impactful statement.\nSpeaker 6: And what he really spoke, talked about was investing in youth and investing in youth works personally. Is that and I won't use the example, but my first year in office, there were three incidents that happened right before I took office violence and impacted four young men.\nSpeaker 6: And I was I was 30 at the time or 29 before right before I took office. And these three men, they met, I mean, they were very similar, similar age. You know, it happened these incidents happened all in the middle of the day between 12 and two and unrelated.\nSpeaker 6: They didn't know each other. But it struck me because I wasn't that far in age from where they were. And I asked myself the question, where was I at 2:00 and during a weekday? Where was I when I was that age?\nSpeaker 6: And I was blessed enough to have the opportunity to go to college? Some people were blessed enough to go into the, you know, have a good job or go into the military. And I always ask my question. I ask myself if we did lean in to those types of opportunities for more of those young people or those\nSpeaker 6: young men in particular, would they have been in that place at that time to be a part of that incident? And I firmly believe that the. More. We invest in them, we can impact their lives and it's backed up by data.\nSpeaker 6: You look at the victims of gun violence going back the last decade, the majority of them between the ages of 18 and 29. And that's the age group. They're vulnerable age group. We know where they are, you know where they live.\nSpeaker 6: And so if we use that, we we should continue to invest in useful. So I believe that we we certainly the way we talk, the way we walk and the way we invest, we have to continue to invest in youth.\nSpeaker 6: And that's the neighborhood support. But I also know as a council member, there's a lot of time where, you know, I actually, you know, set a budget aside because when bad things happen, they get they need to get a phone call.\nSpeaker 6: There's community support that needs to happen. You talk to the neighborhood group, you go do a community walk these things on violence happens. It it leaves and it makes an impact on the community. And so our communities want the shootings to stop.\nSpeaker 6: And we are one city team. So there needs to be invested in community and there also needs to be suppression. Police are a part of our city team. There needs to be we need to look at it comprehensively.\nSpeaker 6: And so as we invest, we need to make sure we're thinking with left side, right side of the brain. And we're doing we're standing up as one city family. In terms of some of the specifics here, I think, you know, question was raised about the bikes.\nSpeaker 6: I've been a fan of bikes because we've had bikes in North Long Beach. I just want to be clear that, you know, we have an uptown business district, but even outside of the Uptown Business District, I want to make sure I want to see some bikes on Artesia Boulevard.\nSpeaker 6: I want to see some bikes on Long Beach Boulevard, Atlantic Avenue. So so just first question. Can we just be clear that the bike program is not limited to the entertainment district? It's a question. No, it's not limited to just the entertainment areas.\nSpeaker 6: As a matter of fact, the primary role in the entertainment areas is more foot beats. That's been very effective. It's the foot beats that saved a young man's life when there was a triple shooting at the park about three weekends ago.\nSpeaker 6: Those are very effective in regards to bicycles. All of you I know have outstanding relationships with your division commanders. If there is an area where you see the need, you can absolutely talk to that commander. And they will provide that service if the staffing allows.\nSpeaker 6: Right. And, you know, I had a community walk with Commander's Able yesterday and she very much so supports doing doing activities. The next thing is, how can we I know that there's talk about business districts and funding for business district.\nSpeaker 6: There's both funding in the recovery plan for business districts. How can what I love to see as a part of this is a plan or strategy for each of those business districts. I don't want just P.D. operating in a silo from the security that assessments pay for.\nSpeaker 6: There's private security there. There are lighting plans. There are September plans. I would really love to see what the strategies are going to be to integrate on the business corridor. Atlantic Avenue. Michelle Obama Library. Artesia Boulevard. Right. Uptown Business, I think, is an example of a business that's very different than, say, the downtown entertainment district.\nSpeaker 6: And it really requires a little bit of focus. And so that's something that I'm going to be looking for. And the last thing I'll say is, with this with this program, I would love to see how we're going to how we're doing right.\nSpeaker 6: Let's get a report back on the safety recovery plan. We've asked for a report backs on every one of the recovery plans. I think this should be no different. So we should have report backs on how on what the impact the community is based on community impact, positive negative use data.\nSpeaker 6: And let's show some some impacts because if these strategies work, we want to stand up and say this strategy worked, this one didn't. And so I think that's incredibly important. So I support what's in front of us today.\nSpeaker 6: I think we can go a little bit further in terms of investment. I'm never going to turn down additional investment for North Long Beach and communities like North Long Beach. I'm never going to turn it down, so we need to continue to invest.\nSpeaker 6: But I support what's in front of us today. Next is Councilwoman Longo.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Chief. You mentioned that your department took well. First, let me go back. Thank you for the presentation. Thank you for staff for putting together the proposal. Thank you for the context that you provided, Mr. Modica. And thank you for all the very passionate speakers and.\nSpeaker 4: To to kind of touch on some other topics that my colleagues said before I go into my list of questions. I just want to echo the comments of my colleague, Councilman Price. I remember when I first was deployed to Lakewood Station, my sergeant said, the first thing you do is call air ops.\nSpeaker 4: It's worth 18 units on the ground. To be able to cordon off an area in a meaningful way is much more comprehensive and and often results in chases and other high risk things where an air support is just a different tool and having sworn.\nSpeaker 4: Both in the pilot's seat and calling out all the different things is just a huge asset that I just don't think people know or understand unless you've heard the difference on the radio. And I say the same of dispatch that I've said it in the past and things like that.\nSpeaker 4: But just to reiterate air support and how impactful it can be. Prevent chases, prevent all other sorts of things and the be safe program huge supporter of be safe every year as budget chair committed additional funds to be safe and I just believe in it so much and I think that it's a great program that we just\nSpeaker 4: have to continue to invest in. And I appreciate. Councilmember Richardson's continued advocacy for his his areas and his districts. I would just reiterate that we all have areas that we think are important, and I would just hope that we continue to focus on the data that's related to the specifics, because I know that the specific comments I'm\nSpeaker 4: sorry I'm losing my breath with this mask.\nSpeaker 6: Is.\nSpeaker 4: Really hard to speak in this mask. I shouldn't have worn burlap mask on on a council night. That the commanders know the data as well. And we just need really responsive data. And I don't know if you're getting the data as quickly.\nSpeaker 4: I know the systems used to not be as I know they were antiquated. I don't know what your time lapse is on accurate data, so I hope that you have that to make those decisions. And then I would just my last question was or I guess my main question, Chief, you mentioned that your department took a $10\nSpeaker 4: million reduction, but I believe you also have a savings target. Do you know what your savings target is this year in terms of millions?\nSpeaker 6: We'll have to get back to you on that.\nSpeaker 4: Because I think that that's another component of this. I mean, if your department's been asked to save $2 million or $3 million or $4 million, I think that that's just another component of of. Areas where there isn't funding.\nSpeaker 4: And while I appreciate that some of these funds are coming in to target specific programs, and that's great. There's a lot of complexity in your budget, and I appreciate that you're you're working through that. And those savings are critical.\nSpeaker 4: I had an item that I've pulled from tonight, but you lost 80 officers last year. And you're about to lose another 30 officers this year. And. It's difficult to be a police officer. And the only way that we can continue to grow with the community is by onboarding.\nSpeaker 5: New.\nSpeaker 4: Young police officers and training them well. And so I really am passionate that you have the resources to make sure that your academy next year is funded. And I'd like to see a way that that happens. I know you have savings targets, but I.\nSpeaker 4: I don't see how we move forward without those things. Targets are one thing, but I'd love to see a dedicated set aside of funding that's necessary to restart your department. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Councilwoman Zoro.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, vice mayor. You know, I do appreciate having, you know, this Long Beach safety recovery plan and that there's just so much that's gone on in all rounds of violence, two crimes. And I think as a person who's come from doing youth development and leadership work as well as violence prevention, I think that that, you know\nSpeaker 2: , I believe and I've always spoken about believing that it works and investing in our community. But I also believe that we do have to have a balanced approach to also making sure that when people do want to call the police, that they're there available.\nSpeaker 2: Right. The services are there because I do get residents requesting for these services. And so I think that it's making sure people also feel that they're getting a response when, you know, as far as calls for police, when they do ask for it.\nSpeaker 2: So so I do believe that with the percentage of youth violence prevention and ensuring that we do think about the programing that is coming through the safety program. And I would like Chief Looney to speak to the community policing aspect of these programing, because I'm interested in learning while some of these are pilot.\nSpeaker 2: I'm interested in learning. How has that improved or is working towards or if it's a that's your goal to work towards increasing, you know, the relationship and trust in the community because that's one of the things that has, you know, in the past year demonstrate has been broken.\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, I'm interested in learning how how you think these programs are helping to do that.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, ma'am. Council member sorrow fundamentally from the time we recruit our officers and I think many of you and many in the audience, potentially even on television, have been involved in our civil service process when we hire new police officers.\nSpeaker 6: And you cannot be hired as a Long Beach police officer unless you talk about community policing, partnerships, diversity. That's the kind of police department we are and we've evolved into. So when that's just getting hired, when we train you.\nSpeaker 6: Whether it's in the academy, which is six months long, and then another year long program out in the field. Those are the things that we emphasize. So in some of these programs we're talking about now, and by the way, the emphasis is really on partnerships.\nSpeaker 6: A police department cannot be successful if it's not partnered with its community and vice versa. You need safety. It comes from both sides, and each and each and every one of our officers is trained that way. The standard is that way.\nSpeaker 6: Do we fall short once in a while? We're human. Of course we do. But I'm proud to say it's probably less than 1% of the time. But in some of these programs we're talking about as an example, our Neighborhood Walks program.\nSpeaker 6: I can't tell you how many police departments around the country are calling us to say, hey, how did you do this? What did you come up with? And basically what that is, is taking officers who work in a beat.\nSpeaker 6: And remember, we work in police cars because our number one priority is response time. We have one of the best priority one response times in the country. When people die, dial 911. They want a police officer there as soon as possible.\nSpeaker 6: So what we did is, hey, how do we connect better with the community? And we tried it first in the Washington Middle School area. We're currently doing it up on the market corridor up in North Division. And it's the officers coming back.\nSpeaker 6: And walking that beat so that people know each other on a first name basis. Yes, in a perfect world, if officers had more time when they get out of the cars to do that, we'd love that. But when we're handling 600 calls for service every 24 hours and making at least a thousand contacts per day in a\nSpeaker 6: 24 hour period, I know there's been some comments in here, but they're false. They're not real. I can give you the data. And when you're doing that, you don't always have the time. In this Neighborhood Walks program. You have the ability to get out and know the kids, know the parents, vice versa.\nSpeaker 6: I want the officers to know then I want them. I want each of them to humanize each other. And that's what our officers are doing. And they're doing an amazing job. There's stories of people just hugging the officers.\nSpeaker 6: Thank God you're here. You hear stories of people not liking cops. That's you get out there. And 80% of the people running it who love the officers in their neighborhood, they absolutely love them. So this program so far is working well.\nSpeaker 6: We modify it as time goes on because we want that connection that will make us safer. A lot of the programs that have been talked about here in the audience will make us safer. It's a collective effort. It is a balanced approach.\nSpeaker 6: And at the end of the day, that's a goal to make our neighborhood safer.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Can I add just one thing? I know my time's up, but I just wanted to make sure to do a shout out for them. Midnight Basketball. I appreciate Mr. Leonard and Mr. Johnson being here to share, and I hope that we can kick off the first midnight basketball in the sixth District where it started.\nSpeaker 2: So I know there has to be an RFP process, but I'm hoping that will get it in and get it kicked off in the sixth District. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. And they have.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much, Vice Mayor, and thank you to staff for the presentation and thank you to both of my first district residents, Carolyn and David, for being here and for speaking up and everybody else who provided their their public comment.\nSpeaker 2: I want to especially thank you, David, for your passion and dedication to our first District youth in our neighborhood, Washington area. I'm very proud to support and help fund your organization, books and budgets, which aims to provide alternative opportunities to our youth in our Washington neighborhood.\nSpeaker 2: In the First District, we continue to face the most shootings and violent crimes. This is why I know it is important that we acknowledge and to work quicker and more efficiently to address these issues of violent crimes and preventative measures.\nSpeaker 2: The reason that we talk so much about safety issues is because we are passionate about that, about speaking up for our youth. We want. Either our youth to grow up in a healthy and safe environment because they are the future and must be a key component of our violence prevention solutions.\nSpeaker 2: That is why I am a huge advocate and supporter of youth programs that seek to mentor, empower and support our youth to to head towards the best possible path for their future and ours. And one particular organization that is introducing this opportunity to the first district community is, again, books and markets, which I am very proud of\nSpeaker 2: . I think that we need to really. Look at programs that are making a difference in the youth that we have in our communities, like midnight basketball, like books and buckets, and so many other programs that help our community heal and that help a community move forward.\nSpeaker 2: Because right now we are going through a lot right now with violent crimes and shootings almost on a on a weekly basis. And it's it's got to stop. And we need to work together to make that happen.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. All right. So just looks like that concludes council comment. Just one outstanding question and thank you, Councilmember Mongo, for raising it. Mister City Manager or Chief, what is the status of the Academy for next year?\nSpeaker 7: So we are planning for an academy next year that is going to be for F1 22. We do fund that using attrition savings and so we can get you some more information on that. We don't have yet a final amount or when.\nSpeaker 7: If you remember, we just graduated an academy in March 2021. We do our looking at attrition rates of probably between 50 and 80 over the next this year that we're going to need to replenish. And so that is planned for F1 22.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. A second question. I know that you're working on and you know, you don't have to share it if you're not ready for it yet. But what can we anticipate? A report on the the paramedic alternative response report that you're working on.\nSpeaker 6: What's the E.T.A. on that tomorrow? Okay. Well, we'll have to look at tomorrow. Okay. All right. Just so here's what I heard. I heard people want a balanced approach. I think your clarification, you know, 5050, that demonstrates a balanced approach.\nSpeaker 6: Council member Sorrell said, Hey, residents, when they pick up the phone, they want to make sure that we have a responsive response time that we show up on time. I hear that from my neighbors. I think that's a universal across across the city.\nSpeaker 6: So I think you're hearing that data and reporting or response data and accountability and reporting. I think that's a standard. Air support has been raised three times by the council. Investments in the community, we really heard that come out very, very clear.\nSpeaker 6: So we need to lead with that in the future investments in the community. And then seems like Midnight Basketball is a pretty popular program, so we're looking forward to hearing when I can get going. That's it. Thank you all for your comments.\nSpeaker 6: And members, please cast your vote.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries eight zero.\nSpeaker 6: All right. So I lost my paper that showed me which item was doing that. Okay. We're going to take we're going to pick up item number 25.\n",
        "summary": "Recommendation to receive a presentation on the proposed Long Beach Safety Recovery Plan (Plan), provide input and policy direction, and approve the Plan and its priorities to address the public safety impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing available federal relief funding; and \r\n\r\nAuthorize City Manager, or designee, to allocate in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY 21) the expenditure of up to $5 million in the General Fund Group to implement the proposed Plan.

        "source": "Speaker 0: We're going to move on to the so-so item here, which is next on the agenda. So if I can have the clerk, please read the.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect Report from Human Resources.\nSpeaker 3: Recommendation received file of fact finding report issued by the Fact Finding.\nSpeaker 1: Panel and adopt a resolution authorizing the implementation of the terms of the city's last, best and final offer.\nSpeaker 4: Described in the October.\nSpeaker 1: 24th, 2018 correspondence to the IAM detailing the scope of service on the Airport Security Division and the Long Beach Police Department and integration citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. We are going to be opening up the next item, which is our 29. Appreciate that. I want to also just I know we're going to go into the item there. There are two parts of this item.\nSpeaker 0: So I just want to make sure that we're clear and it will require two separate votes as presented by the staff. The first part of the vote is to receive and file the fact finding report, which we will hear in a minute from staff as part of the this process.\nSpeaker 0: The second part, obviously, is actually adopting a resolution that would actual implement the terms of the city's last, best and final offer. It's there there has been a lot of discussion on this item, a lot of interest, rightly so, on an item that is important for us as a community.\nSpeaker 0: And so my recommendation is going to be that we hear the report as presented by staff. Then we allow the Council to ask all of its questions, which I think are important. There are a lot of questions that we also allow the public to comment so that the public is able to give their perspective on the report\nSpeaker 0: and their input, and so that the public the public process is out in the open. And then we receive and file the report as presented by staff. The second part of the motion, which is actually to implement the last, best and final offer, I'm going to recommend that we postpone the second part and to to a later\nSpeaker 0: date in May, a set by the city manager so that there could be some additional consideration by the council and some possible discussion. And so that is what will be my recommendation. Obviously, the Council will have an opportunity to to to look at that as we move forward.\nSpeaker 0: But I want to begin then the first part of this, which is the receive and file of the fact finding report. And and we'll go from there. So with that, Mr. West.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Council members. So our goal tonight, the action before you tonight will place our well, the action before you tonight. We'll place our police department in a supervisory capacity over all of our law enforcement officers at our Long Beach Airport.\nSpeaker 8: Currently, our 27 airport special security officers, all who carry firearms, are supervised by the airport director who has no public safety supervisory experience, not the police department. This is simply an organizational shift. All SOS will continue to carry weapons.\nSpeaker 8: All Eso's will continue to be. I am members. All Eso's will continue to work their regular duties at the airport. All Eso's will continue to maintain their classifications and salaries. This organization shift simply puts our eso's at the airport under police department supervision.\nSpeaker 8: There is precedent for this. In 2004, we had 30 Marine patrol officers. All of those officers carried weapons. They all reported to the Marine bureau manager who had no public safety experience. In 2004, we shifted our Marine patrol officers to the police department where they are supervised now by the police department.\nSpeaker 8: These Marine bureau patrol folk continue to carry firearms. They continue to be. I am members. They continue to be Marine patrol officers. They're simply now supervised by the police department as opposed to the Marine bureau manager who had no public safety experience.\nSpeaker 8: Just recently we removed we moved our park rangers from Parks and Recreation to the police department instead of being supervised by the Parks and Recreation director, again, who has no public safety supervisory experience. These park rangers are now supervised by the police department.\nSpeaker 8: They continue to carry firearms. They continue to be. I am members. They continue to be park rangers. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to our H.R. director and one of our managers. So Alex Vasquez and Dana Anderson will give the report.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, mayor and council members. I want to introduce Dana Anderson. She's the bureau manager for labor relations and also Elmer Rodriguez Moosa, who's our outside counsel there, was involved in our negotiations on this.\nSpeaker 3: Particular item that went to a fact finding. So I'm going to turn over to Dana first and then we're happy to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 12: So that evening, Mayor and city council over the past year, representatives from city management and to enter in the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, also known as I am, have held a number of meet and confer sessions regarding the impacts of the integration of the Airport Security Division and the airport police detail into one section\nSpeaker 12: which would fall under the command and control of the Long Beach Police Department. The decision to integrate is to provide efficiencies through a better coordination of effort and one structural chain of command, both resources and personnel, including supervision, training and and deployment of staff to achieve consistency of public safety and maximize airport security efforts.\nSpeaker 12: The airport security division has been providing security and safety services for decades, and in response to increased security concerns following the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, the police department assigned an airport detail to augment the airport security division.\nSpeaker 12: In 2002, the city noticed the item in January 2015 of its intent to integrate the airport security division special services officers, also known as SOS and the Airport Police Division into one division to align their respective responsibilities, which was scheduled to move forward on April 1st, 2015, but was delayed.\nSpeaker 12: The purpose here is to have police in a supervisory capacity over law enforcement officers. At the airport on January 26, 2018, the city decided to proceed with the integration and again noticed I am of its intent to integrate the airport security division personnel and the airport police detail into the newly created airport police section.\nSpeaker 12: The reorganization was adopted by City Council for f y 19, contingent upon the completion of the ME to confer process with applicable unions. The reorganization does not impact employee salaries and would not result in additional police officer or CSO positions, and the requested action is not expected to require additional staff hours beyond the norm.\nSpeaker 12: The normal budget is scope of duties. After several months of negotiations and exchanges of proposals, the city declared impasse and provided written notification to. I am on October 24th, 2018 that we included the terms of the city's last, best and final offer, detailing the scope of service and items discussed as part of the public sector.\nSpeaker 12: Negotiation process. Once impasse has been declared, unions have the option to request a fact finding before an agency can impose their last, best and final offer. I am requested fact finding on November 21st, 2018, and the fact finding hearing was held on February 8th, 2019.\nSpeaker 12: The panel's report being issued on March 5th, 2019, which is attached to the council letter. The fact finding panel's report is advisory and provided the recommendation that the city implement its last, best and final offer for reasons stated in the fact finding panel's report.\nSpeaker 12: The city concurred with the recommendations of the fact finding panel and requests city's authorization to implement the terms of the city's last, best and final offer. This concludes the presentation and we are open to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 0: Great. I know we do have questions from council. I think there's been requests to do public comment and hear from the public first. So if you have public comment on this item, remember there's only one motion on the table right now which is to receive and file the report.\nSpeaker 0: So, please, any public comment, please come forward. The second part when we vote on the second part of the motion, which would be to to postpone the staff recommendation to implement that there would be public comment on that item as well, I believe.\nSpeaker 0: Right. Mr. City Attorney.\nSpeaker 10: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So there's no I see no public comment on the receiving file of fact finding report. So let me go ahead and begin with Councilwoman Munger.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I have. Empathy for the police officers. Many of you know that I am a peace officer in the state of California, and so I empathize with the concerns of our USO's having lost some of their status.\nSpeaker 4: And it's my understanding that they have up to three years to join a general law enforcement agency. So one of the things that I think might be helpful is finding a way to get there. I don't think that that really happens in this process.\nSpeaker 4: And so with that, I'm open to hearing from my colleagues.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 3: And thank you. STAFF So I just wanted to to clarify a couple of things. You mentioned that. The officers would stay eso's.\nSpeaker 8: Yes. Correct.\nSpeaker 3: And that there would be no effect to their salaries. Correct. Is that indefinitely, or is there a time in the future that that could change?\nSpeaker 8: Would only change if there through a city council action there. Suppose we need them to be at the airport and we have no intention of changing their status at all.\nSpeaker 3: So the changes that they would be supervised by PD.\nSpeaker 8: It just who supervises them? Police department or the airport director.\nSpeaker 3: Or the airport director? Okay. Second question is and I know that there's some questions that we you know, just if you can answer this question, that'd be great. How many hours of training do officers do so officers currently have and how many would they be receiving if the supervision changed?\nSpeaker 8: I don't know how many they currently have. Perhaps someone else can answer that. I do know that by going to the police department with the training bureau, they'll have the opportunity. I think Post is going to offer, you know, 38 more training opportunities than they have today.\nSpeaker 8: So we expect the opportunity for much more training.\nSpeaker 3: I think we have the chief there. Chief, are you able to answer that question?\nSpeaker 10: Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best to try to answer that. So, Mayor. Members of the City Council. Any training moving forward would be proportional to the security officers duties. I believe under what we're proposing, the actual training would increase as we move forward as we have with.\nSpeaker 10: Please note that we have over 120 security officers that work for the police department now. Mr. West indicated some of the positions there and in all cases, when people were brought in under the brought to or under the umbrella of the police department, the training actually increased.\nSpeaker 10: That is obviously our field, whether we're talking about general law enforcement or security. And we're able to go out and look for the appropriate training classes so that all of our employees, whether sworn, civilian or otherwise, can participate in the best training to provide the best service to our community.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Moving forward, I would love to to know some solid numbers moving forward, but for tonight, I'm okay. Um, I also wanted a point of clarification. I thought there was 27, as I said. Is that are airport.\nSpeaker 10: That's correct. There are currently 27 budgeted positions for security officers at the airport. And just to go back to your the previous question about training so we can complete that tonight, we are proposing that as we move the security officers from the airport under our family to Long Beach Police Department, that they're going to be attending a\nSpeaker 10: 30 hour Long Beach Police Department specific course designated to assimilate them into our organization and working environment. Beyond that, our department provides advanced officers training that we do provide to some of our security officers every year, and they would fall under that as well, which they do not currently receive in their current airport climate.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And one other point of clarification. There's 27 budgeted positions. How many positions are actually filled right now?\nSpeaker 10: I believe it's 15.\nSpeaker 3: 15. I think there's 15 actually less than. Is there a reason why those positions aren't filled up to the full 27.\nSpeaker 10: Primarily because of a lot of what's going on here tonight. We've been going back and forth, would meet, confer and so on and so forth. And I think we in order to move forward and in order to fill those positions, we need to make sure that new employees coming in know exactly what they're going to be, what\nSpeaker 10: duties are going to be performing.\nSpeaker 3: Great. Thank you. I want to, you know, recognize that I asked some of these questions previously of you and of staff. And, you know, this is one of those areas that there's there's a lot of information that's available.\nSpeaker 3: And as a councilmember really trying to make the best decision and really trying to have all the facts in front of us so that we understand, obviously, an airport, you know, having 80% of the port in my district, safety is an utmost concern for me.\nSpeaker 3: And thinking about our airport the same. And so the question that I had asked before was, have there been issues, have there been situations outside of fact finding that we can do this? Have there been situations that cause concern for yourself or for our city manager on making this shift?\nSpeaker 10: I will do my best to answer that as well as your police chief. I have put this proposal to integrate forward as part of a team with the city manager under the direction of the city manager and in conjunction with the Human Resource Department and the City Attorney's Office.\nSpeaker 10: I would not be putting my name to anything that I didn't think was going to be advantageous to our entire community as far as safety goes. We're talking about the Long Beach Airport. The Long Beach Airport is ours and it is our intent to keep that safe.\nSpeaker 10: 24 seven. I know there's been a lot of comments made recently in the media, which I think are absolutely ridiculous that we're not going to be keeping an eye on our airport 24 seven which does cause citizens to call in and say, What the heck is going on?\nSpeaker 10: I'm not in the business of scaring people. I'm in the business of protecting people. And I assure our community that we are going to this plan will make our airport safer. So to continue with that, if you look at and again, the security officers that we have at the airport, great people, every single one of them.\nSpeaker 10: I can't wait if all of you approve to have them as part of our organizational family. But we've got to think about liability. And as we move forward in this current security and law enforcement environment, there has never been a time when law enforcement or security is being questioned more about what we do on an everyday basis\nSpeaker 10: . Everybody we stop. Everybody that we deal with constantly questions our policies. They question the level of accountability that we have. So when we're talking about use of force, foot pursuits, vehicle pursuits, all those things, those are things that we considered as we looked at the current policies that either exist or don't exist to make sure that we\nSpeaker 10: were going to, one, make this airport and community safer and allow this body to be as free of of risk or liability as we possibly could. So at the end of the day, that's why I'm recommending to you that recommending to you as a chief of police, that I'm I get held accountable, putting my name on the\nSpeaker 10: bottom of the paper when I am reviewing a use of force or something, God forbid, something more significant that your chief of police should be handling. And I think this community expects their chief of police to handle those type of challenges.\nSpeaker 8: Councilor, I'd like to point out, too, that a lot of this is coming from me as your city manager. Basically, it's just a personal promise that I have that I personally don't have law enforcement supervisor experience, so I shouldn't be supervising department that carries weapons, carries firearms, carrying lethal weapons.\nSpeaker 8: Additionally, our airport director, interim director Claudia Lewis, currently right now, she is the supervisor of 27 people at the airport that that carry weapons. And and clearly, Claudia doesn't have that supervisory experience either. So we just feel, as we did with the Marine bureau, as you do with the park rangers, if you're carrying lethal weapons, you should\nSpeaker 8: be under the police department's purview and not the not a department head.\nSpeaker 3: So I appreciate the response. And I think for all the reasons, Chief, that you laid out is probably why we have some community concerns coming up. And I just want to be honest, because I know that we've had lots of these conversations.\nSpeaker 3: And and so that's why it's taken me a step back today to be able to. Making the right decision. And if we haven't had those situations yet, that we really are thoughtful about this next step. So I want to hear from my colleagues.\nSpeaker 3: You know, I appreciate the 30 extra hour offer. I don't know what they currently got. And want to just clarify that there's 1527 currently there. But I look forward to hearing from my colleagues. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Vice Mayor Andrews.\nSpeaker 7: Yes, thank you, Mayor. Before I get started here and some of my questions I will be asking can be done with the yes or no. Before I get started, I just want to state that the Long Beach, you know, has a great police department and a great airport, which has a great group of security officers who have\nSpeaker 7: the primary responsibility for securing the safety of the airport. I understand the efficiency that can occur by placing so under the police department control. However, I want to fully understand the potential impact to safety and security as well as working conditions of Esso.\nSpeaker 7: My questions are and they can be done with the yes or no with the number of positions sold at the airport be maintained.\nSpeaker 8: Yes.\nSpeaker 7: Well, the hours of deployment be maintained 24, seven and through and 65 days a year.\nSpeaker 8: Yes.\nSpeaker 7: What is the status of the so?\nSpeaker 8: Chief.\nSpeaker 10: I'm sorry, Councilman. Can you please or. I'm sorry, Vice Mayor, can you please repeat the question?\nSpeaker 7: What is the status of an as? Oh, would that be maintained or if not, well. Well, if it not maintaining with the SS. Oh. Have the equivalent of training. You are posturing. Yes.\nSpeaker 10: I'm sorry, sir. The status will remain the same.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. And will it be maintained? You're saying? Yes. Or if not will to maintain be the CSO have the equivalent of the training that the others have.\nSpeaker 12: I'm sorry. Are you asking about that? The post training?\nSpeaker 7: Yes. What is the status of that for the ASOS?\nSpeaker 10: Okay. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't understand you. That was my fault. On the first one regarding the post training. Post is a state organization and initially there were several officers who attained post certificates. And when Post went back to review the information, they found that they incorrectly issued those certificates.\nSpeaker 10: And so that is a state of California post issue that does not have anything to do with the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, uh, another question. Will this move affect any representation by the I am training status in a direction that people are under?\nSpeaker 8: No.\nSpeaker 7: I think because of that, I really think this is kind of confusion and I don't think we should have really ever gotten to this point. But I'm going be willing to listen to my other colleagues and I'll move on from there.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So my colleagues have asked some good questions, and so I won't try to dove into the weeds here. So. Mr. City Manager so we've been in negotiation for a period of time. It's come to a point where a fact finding was requested.\nSpeaker 6: That fact finding report we received today, that fact finding report summed up, essentially said that that the chief has the authority to make this make this change. Correct.\nSpeaker 8: The city manager has the authority.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. And so the city manager certainly now, I guess there's a sentiment in the community that there if the council voted to if we had voted to do that, there's an unintended consequence of somehow the security circumstances that at the airport would somehow be diminished.\nSpeaker 6: And there's also a concern about not being federally compliant or not having a federal law enforcement official on site 24 hours. So my question is, can you, Mr. Chief, can you just speak to whether there's. I know that there's a perception, but is there anything to this?\nSpeaker 6: And and have you have you done any thinking about this this federal issue? Have you heard about this issue of this federal standard of a law enforcement official needing to be on site 24 hours?\nSpeaker 8: Councilmember Before we answer the first part, let's get to the second one. I'm going to turn it over to Gary perhaps to have that discussion. Actually, Marion, councilmembers are going to have outside counsel Irma.\nSpeaker 10: Rodriguez addressed the federal issue that you just raised about. Sure. The quality of it.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mayor, and members of the council. This issue, with respect to the legality of the proposal under the homeland security regulations was first raised at the Fact-Finding Panel stage by IAM. I have carefully reviewed the cited regulations and I'm here to opine that the proposal with respect to the integration complies with those regulations.\nSpeaker 4: And I'll explain why the regulations generally set forth that the city or the operate in which the airport operates has a discretion to determine for itself the appropriate security program. And what it is required to do is to have an appropriate number and manner of security program that is adequate to support our security at an airport here\nSpeaker 4: . The city has is not changing the program. It is changing the reporting of where the ESOS currently report. There is no plan to change the number of individuals, change the number of hours and in fact has been previously testified.\nSpeaker 4: The program is intended to enhance security by allowing the CISOs to focus on security duties at the airport as opposed to on near the airport premises. Second, the regulations also require that those individuals who are providing these security services have to meet certain minimum qualifications and have certain training programs as to the minimum qualification they have to\nSpeaker 4: have the authority to arrest. Nothing in this proposal changes that authority. They will continue to meet the minimum qualification of having the authority to arrest. With respect to the training program, what the regulations provide is, again, discretion to the local agency to provide a training program that it believes satisfies its security program detail.\nSpeaker 4: And it says, quite frankly, that it can either be state regulations or guidelines or local agency or guidelines. The reason it is my opinion that the state regulations are satisfied is that the state agency post has determined that the CISOs do not need to be a post certified to in order to do their position.\nSpeaker 4: Second, our local agency, our police department, has developed a training program that they believe is best tailored to provide the training that the security officers need to provide the security services. So that is my assessment of the legal homeland security regulations.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. And then the second part, someone will respond to me.\nSpeaker 8: I'm sorry. Could you repeat the first question? Sure.\nSpeaker 6: So he so much for that that explanation on. So I see some diligence have been done to that that issue. The second piece is that there's a perception that there's an unintended consequence to making this change, that somehow there is the airport is less safe.\nSpeaker 6: And if there is and my interest is simply if we take the bargaining process to the side, you know, and separate that because that has its own processes and it appears that's being followed, if there's an unintended consequence, consequence for safety, then I'd just like to sort of narrow the conversation and see if there's a gap.\nSpeaker 6: How do we just fill the gap and ensure that that the presence of safety is still there? So I guess the question is, is there a lack of service? Is there going to be a period of time where there will be no, you know, no security at the airport?\nSpeaker 6: Any gaps in service whatsoever?\nSpeaker 10: Councilman Richardson? No, the simple answer to that is no.\nSpeaker 6: Okay.\nSpeaker 10: As we move forward, the plan, the proposed integration plan that we put together utilizes the expertize of the airport security officers that we have. The airport police officers that we have, puts them under one chain of command under a police lieutenant, which was an out there before.\nSpeaker 10: Improves communication and coordination. Maintains regulatory compliance. And at the end of the day, when we're talking about safety, it's not only community safety but officer safety. And so we're mitigating liability. At the same time, we believe that our organizational values, our training programs, our equipment, our resources and our discipline will improve safety for everybody involved out there\nSpeaker 10: and make it much better than what it has been.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Love to hear from the public. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember. Councilor appears.\nSpeaker 3: I had first the question were at 12 or 15 oiseaux at the airport. We also have new flights coming and going. So I'm assume that we're going to have more people coming and going. And so can we get a timeline on when we expect all 27 positions to be filled regardless of this process or not?\nSpeaker 8: We'll be able to get you something right away, perhaps in a day or two.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And then my next one is more of a comment and not a question because we're kind of dancing around it. The question of airport security for me is, one, the number of hours of training. And I appreciate the number of hours that our police chief has told us.\nSpeaker 3: I look forward to hearing from IAM on how many hours of training they provide. And two is just the reality that some folks, people of color, Latinos, friends just don't feel comfortable around. PD So the question for me is, are these officers going to be in security clothes?\nSpeaker 3: Are they going to be in PD clothes if they were to switch over?\nSpeaker 10: I absolutely respect the fact about the people of color, which I am one of. About the way they feel about police. That's the way I grew up in regards to uniforms. And just going back to the training. In the last several years, our police officers have received many hours in training with implicit bias, procedural justice.\nSpeaker 10: And I could go on and on.\nSpeaker 3: You know, I know you have that.\nSpeaker 10: We've had in regards to the uniform that the airport security officers will be wearing, the uniform itself will not change.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Look forward to public comment.\nSpeaker 0: Councilwoman Mungo.\nSpeaker 4: I just want to ask another question. Is our airport safe? Currently are we meeting the standards and is our airport safe? Because I'm it's just really frustrating and irresponsible to lead the public to believe otherwise, unless it is factually.\nSpeaker 8: I'm going to answer that first. I'll leave it I'll leave it to the chief in a moment. And I'm looking to our interim director, Claudia Lewis. If we do not have a safe airport, we will not have an airport.\nSpeaker 8: Our airport would be shut down so fast if we didn't have a if we didn't have an ability to provide safety with our fire department. There are police department there working with TSA and FFA. So I just want to assure you that there is no such thing as a as an unsafe airport.\nSpeaker 8: If you have an unsafe airport, the airport's gone. You don't have an airport.\nSpeaker 4: I appreciate that. I think that it's really important to just be clear that it is still safe to travel out of Long Beach Airport. No flights have been added since 2000 and maybe 16. When we added the nine slots, we're still at 50 slots a day in and out of the airport.\nSpeaker 4: And so the passenger ratio and the flights and all of that has been maintained. Many of you know what the airport is in my district. Many of you also know that I am a PC a32 certified. I'm a PC eight 30.2 certified peace officer in the state of California.\nSpeaker 4: I'm very familiar with the training requirements. I've had extensive discussions about these changes and I had a wish we wouldn't be where we are right now. But I. I hope that in listening to the public, we can hear from them potential solutions to to make sure that we can find a way to get through this tonight.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Thank you so much. And I'm of the same mindset. I think we're all here for the similar purpose, consistency and safety. First, of course. Just a couple clarifying questions, I think, to Councilman Richardson's point. You know, we did receive a letter from our Congressmember Alan Lowenthal, and I just wanted to make sure I was getting clear\nSpeaker 1: as to what is currently. Who currently has the authority now to arrest on in the airport. I'm just get I need to get that clear in my head as to if there's any changes once if this were to move forward what type of training.\nSpeaker 1: I know we've gone over it, but I need to just get that super crystal clear as to where we're at now and what this would.\nSpeaker 8: There would be no changes to arrests or how it operates.\nSpeaker 1: None whatsoever.\nSpeaker 8: None whatsoever. They're just BS. You would still be supervised by the police department instead of Miss Louis, so they would basically be exactly the same, except you've got someone to you differently and there will be other training opportunities.\nSpeaker 1: So there's no difference in authority versus PD or ESSOS right now.\nSpeaker 8: Well, the authority the authority would go through the police department instead of Ms.. Lewis.\nSpeaker 1: Right. Okay. Okay. Second question.\nSpeaker 0: Maybe, councilman, to stand to partly answer that question, maybe you were alluding to this. And I mean, I'm not sure if everyone is aware. So currently as it exists right now, Palm Beach PD operates out of the airport.\nSpeaker 0: And so currently we both have both Eso's and we have also the Long Beach Police Department. And they actually work together concurrently on airport security, along with other federal agencies, airport staff and a variety of of security measures.\nSpeaker 0: Of course, that's necessary with both the federal level and the local level to make security happen. And so just also want to clarify that I think there's a misconception about PD being there or not being there. And Lombard PD is on site as of course, are the the S.O. team.\nSpeaker 8: Aps-C trackers, 15 police officers assigned to the airport. There's 27 eso's assigned to the airport.\nSpeaker 12: There's.\nSpeaker 1: I think that's why I'm mentioning this, because I think there is a lot of confusion around that. And you're seeing we're seeing it out in the press as well. So I just want to make sure we're I know it's difficult, but, you know, just to make sure we're super clear on that, because I don't think everyone understands\nSpeaker 1: that necessarily. And then the second question is. Also the proposed I mean, there's a proposed schedule that would include gaps, you know, between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.. So we're saying there would not be any gaps. Again, I'm just want to make sure we're clear because it is out there.\nSpeaker 1: And I know, Chief, you've mentioned that that is not the case. So if you can just can continue responding to that.\nSpeaker 10: Councilwoman again, Councilwoman Gonzalez, thank you for that question. And it's something that keeps on coming up. Again, there were misstatements made in the press rhetoric. They're not factual. Our airport is covered 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nSpeaker 10: And for our citizens or anyone that intends to travel through the Long Beach Airport or Long Beach Airport is absolutely safe. Are we always looking for ways to improve? Absolutely we are. But for anybody who either read or heard on the radio that we don't have any coverage between 10 p.m., 11 p.m. and 5 p.m..\nSpeaker 10: If anybody out there is listening to me, watching me on television, you try to commit a crime at the Long Beach Airport. During those hours, you're going to get arrested. There's going to be consequences. That airport is safe.\nSpeaker 10: It's covered. It has been and it will be.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And I think, again, I'm we're going to capture that and put it somewhere, because I think everyone needs to understand that that's very important. So with that, I would just say thank you for this. I'm looking forward to hearing more as well.\nSpeaker 1: I needed to clarify a few things on my end because it did get a little bit hazy on on my end in understanding where we're currently at. And then what brought this forward even after, you know, we've had a lot of catastrophes in the past and now it's, you know, some time later and we want to make\nSpeaker 1: sure we're keeping the airport as safe as possible here in Long Beach. Those are my questions and we will move forward.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I'll be brief. This is a while. It seems like it's more complicated than it needs to be, in my opinion. I think I did have a couple of questions just to kind of summarize how we got here.\nSpeaker 5: The meeting confirmed process, whenever there is a change in policy or duties or wages and benefits, there's there's an obligation to meet and confer. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 12: Yes.\nSpeaker 5: Can you explain to the public and those listening what the meeting confer actually consist of?\nSpeaker 12: Sure. So the meeting of our process basically consist of the well, actually in this particular instance, this was a managerial decision whenever the city has the authority to make management decisions. But whenever we do so, we have to me to confer over the impacts of that actual decision.\nSpeaker 12: So in this particular instance that the media confer comprised of the impact of the changes as a result of PD taking oversight of the airport security officers.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. So during the meeting for process, obviously you met and confer with the bargaining representatives. I am.\nSpeaker 12: Correct. That is correct. Both I am in.\nSpeaker 2: And.\nSpeaker 5: How many meetings that you have in over or over what period of time?\nSpeaker 12: There were ten meetings, approximately eight and a half months.\nSpeaker 5: How long did each meeting last?\nSpeaker 12: Approximately about an hour and a half.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And where? A proposal was exchanged.\nSpeaker 12: The city presented a, I believe, a total of seven. And we received one from I am.\nSpeaker 5: I wanted to to also discuss the existing chain of command at the airport with as a source. We've heard that they report to the airport director. But in terms of strategic security protocols and things of that nature, who do they report to now?\nSpeaker 5: What is the chain of command for?\nSpeaker 12: So currently the chain of command at the airport. The CEOs report directly to the deputy director, Mr. Juan Rios Lopez.\nSpeaker 5: Mr. Lopez. Well, welcome. Okay. And does he have any sort of security?\nSpeaker 12: No, he does not. He does not have. No, he does not have any security background or specialty or certifications.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. So that brings me to my next point. In terms of training existing, what type of existing training like for the skills today? What type of training do they receive to do their job and to keep our air ports safe?\nSpeaker 12: So currently there was a policy established in 2016 which afforded the opposed to go to post post training.\nSpeaker 5: Up until when it started?\nSpeaker 12: Well, I think they have been doing it prior to, but I believe there were varying levels between Poles wanting to. But as of 2016, they established an actual policy stating.\nSpeaker 5: So let me go back to the is there a supervisor, is there a a.\nSpeaker 10: A.\nSpeaker 5: Like a lieutenant? Is there a chain of command for the officials existing?\nSpeaker 12: Currently there's the SS. So low levels they have three and then they have for which the fourth act as supervisors. But they report directly to Mr. Lopez Rios.\nSpeaker 5: It's a supervisor position, not a lead position.\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And so the existing training you said is it was was Porte Post or is post.\nSpeaker 12: Correct. Currently, because we haven't we haven't moved forward in the integration. So currently it is post.\nSpeaker 5: And it was since 2015, there's been no training.\nSpeaker 12: So there haven't been any new souls to be sent to training.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And if they were to go under the direction of the Long Beach PD and the chief of police, I heard the chief say that there would be more training opportunities. And that kind of concerns me a little bit because to me there it doesn't sound like there has been a whole lot of emphasis on training and\nSpeaker 5: perhaps the chief could answer this question should this this integration happen? What type of training would you be able to provide these employees to keep our airports safe beyond what they have already received and what they're receiving now?\nSpeaker 4: So one thing I'd like to clarify. So one of the things that will happen with this integration is that.\nSpeaker 2: Or.\nSpeaker 3: As we were going through the mean confer process.\nSpeaker 4: We also recognized that it was necessary to evaluate what type of training is appropriate for the duties that the CISOs perform. And I think that's one of the.\nSpeaker 3: Key things that came out.\nSpeaker 4: Of this process is just identifying what level of training is appropriate, and then also identifying other post certified training that could be made available to the employees. And that's what we outlined in the report. But I'll go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: To the chief. Sorry. You don't have to get.\nSpeaker 10: Councilman Austin and try and answer your questions. So in regards to the opportunities for post training, there are at least I mean, look at my notes. I don't want to get the number incorrect. There are 36 courses in the post catalog that are hopefully new employees will have an opportunity to go to in the future.\nSpeaker 10: And they they range from and there's a lot of really cool training. So just like our employees do, they, they, they can go into a catalog for post and look at what's proportionate to their duties and then through a supervisor approving it, we can go there.\nSpeaker 10: And I do want to clarify, you asked a very good question earlier and it was in regards to post training, to give you an example. A Long Beach police officer, like the ones you see sitting behind you, they get about 3000 hours of training, which is divided from a six month academy to a six month fill training\nSpeaker 10: officer certified program through post and then another six months of a probationary period. We do have individuals. I'd have to look at the entire background as to how it happened. I don't know how we got there, but individuals were allowed to go to post certified training.\nSpeaker 10: And then what ends up happening is in order to be classified by post as a peace officer, you have to enter a department that does general law enforcement to be certified with that FTO program and that probationary period.\nSpeaker 10: Unfortunately for our airport security officers, that's not available because they weren't part of a general law enforcement police department. So in a sense and I can fill I think I could fill with that. They're saying, man, I feel like I got cheated here.\nSpeaker 10: But coming if this integration gets approved, what we're going to be able to do is not only train them in perishable skills training that we afford our own employees, but we're able to identify other courses through post because they are now part of the Long Beach Police Department where their training will be enhanced.\nSpeaker 5: So would their in-service training be enhanced because they are part of Long Beach PD?\nSpeaker 10: Their training is absolutely going to improve from what they have now.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And then the the other piece is the post training. Who pays for that?\nSpeaker 10: What we do as a police department. So that will be a I'm sorry I cut you off.\nSpeaker 5: That will be afforded to to these fellows as well, should they choose to, to go to various post training that may be afforded to them, that may be within the the scope of their duties.\nSpeaker 10: Every employee will get a piece of the pie.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. I have no further questions. Thank you for the clarification. And, Mr. Mayor, I'm a I'm okay with with what? Postponing the other vote. But I do think that hopefully there is some some opportunity between now and when this comes back for the I am the employee group as well as our union.\nSpeaker 5: I want to talk about hopefully some some amicable solutions that we can move this forward on this. This is obviously safety and airport and consistency is number one. And to the to the employees, I'll just tell you, I've taken this issue very seriously.\nSpeaker 5: I've talked to your leaders. Sal Vasquez is, you know, one of my favorites. I appreciate always the conversations with you. I've read your email, you section six, a memo. You is very clear. And and I do understand that that we're where the city is trying to go in terms of streamlining the operation.\nSpeaker 5: And so hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Councilmember Ringa.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. For purposes of transparency, I did have meetings with the IAM, with the city manager, with the chief of police to talk about and H.R. to talk about this very issue. And I think during all those conversations, there was no question about the integrity and the dedication that our souls have to the airport and what value\nSpeaker 11: they have in the security. But is it safe? But and Councilmember Austin brought up something about the meeting code, a process which also included in the remaining code for process is a change in working conditions. And I think this is what this is.\nSpeaker 11: Basically, it's a whole issue about working conditions, changing basically the authority or the oversight of vessels in the airport from the airport director to the chief of police. I see that as a basic premise here in terms of what the issues are.\nSpeaker 11: We went through fact finding because of the fact that that wasn't able to be resolved in terms of what that transition or that change would bring to the systems in the airport and the integration, if you will, of police officers into also incorporating the airport as part of their responsibilities as well.\nSpeaker 11: So the overall overlying issue that I see here is not so much that there's going to be a loss of pay or change of hours or a change in in in responsibilities and most importantly, a a decline or a lessening of safety for the public at our airports.\nSpeaker 11: I don't see that at all. This is a management problem. The management issue, it's it's one that management has a right to manage. I can understand that. I think all three of the four of the bodies that i talked to in terms of the iam and h.r.\nSpeaker 11: Police and city manager, we all they all understand that we all we all know that. However, it's the transition and the integration integration of PD and s so into the into one that is the issue here and that has not been resolved.\nSpeaker 11: So I would support going, receiving and filing this report as we have it now. As Mayor said, however, on the second motion, I think that we I also would support that as well. Give it some time. I think that the all of the by all the all the authorities concerned here need to work that out.\nSpeaker 11: You need to get into a point of. Yes. Where we can all get together and agree. And at one point there's going to be an agree to disagree. But I feel more comfortable knowing that you all had have have had that very focused discussion about the actual integration and what it really means in regards to the CIOs\nSpeaker 11: and their change in working conditions, because that's what it comes down to as far as as I see it. So just one question. What does the receiver of file motion do right now for this integration plan and follow that up with the the motion to to put it up for to sometime in May.\nSpeaker 8: By taking a bow tonight just to receive in follow.\nSpeaker 10: You're just accepting the fact that you had the final report from the venue panel and you're receiving it. You're accepting it. You're taking no further action other than that.\nSpeaker 11: Okay.\nSpeaker 10: The second vote will come later tonight. If you wish to postpone, I'm taking some formal action.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. I'm good.\nSpeaker 0: And customer super anon.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I'd also like to hear public comment. But I just had one thought on when Councilman Gonzales was asking, like, can we memorialize the fact that we have security there? I just look to the year 2017 when JetBlue violated our late night noise ordinance 676 times.\nSpeaker 6: So that's on average, 1.85 operations per night. Guess what? Not only was there security, there we were. The airport was open by all practical purposes.\nSpeaker 10: So that to airport.\nSpeaker 6: Impacted council districts like like I represent that. That was very unnerving to hear that the airport had no security. So I'm glad to put that myth to rest. And the other question I have, and this is related to the noise ordinance.\nSpeaker 10: When we looked.\nSpeaker 6: At reworking that.\nSpeaker 10: We look to.\nSpeaker 6: Other best practices and other airports. And did the fact finding group ever do that? You know, what scenario is that Orange County or other airports? Was that part of the study?\nSpeaker 0: The noise.\nSpeaker 12: Ordinance. Can you repeat the question, please?\nSpeaker 6: I brought up the noise ordinance because we don't want to revisit 2017 and staff and our city attorney is looking at different systems to improve our to reduce the number of late night violations. They looked at other airports and practices at other airports regarding noise violations or rules.\nSpeaker 6: Did the fact finding group look at best case scenarios at other airports on the security issue and whatnot or was not not part of the study?\nSpeaker 12: So the fact finding panel didn't look at particularly noise ordinance, but they did look at other security initiatives.\nSpeaker 6: I'm sorry. I guess I misspoke. Okay. I brought up the noise ordinance because it's an analogy of how.\nSpeaker 10: We tackle one problem.\nSpeaker 6: We looked at other airports, okay, now we have a security issue or a security force issue. Did we look at other airports, how they operate, what they do? Thank you.\nSpeaker 12: So, yes, as part of this process, we did look at other agencies as part of the fact finding process and the media confer. And there.\nSpeaker 4: Are.\nSpeaker 12: I believe there was a total of 11 other agencies that have police over security of the airport.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. And would you happen to know if you know what.\nSpeaker 10: Airports are what.\nSpeaker 6: Are the practices in airports similar to our size, our our community and whatnot?\nSpeaker 12: So the airports that we that were reviewed were Burbank, San Jose International City of L.A. International. Oakland International. John Wayne Irvine. San Diego International. So on here. I only brought five with me. Oh, I'm sorry. So Oakland, Ontario, Palm Springs International.\nSpeaker 12: Sacramento International, Santa Barbara and San Jose International.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. And the findings there are are what exactly?\nSpeaker 12: So the findings that all of those airports operate under the same manner in which we're proposing in which the police department have or has oversight.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thank you for that. I'm going to go ahead and support the motion to postpone the decision and move on to a date. Not certain, but possibly in May.\nSpeaker 8: Mayor, I just one clarification, please. When I said there would be one change of physical for the service, would not be allowed to make traffic stops as we go forward. They continue to be allowed to make arrests, but not traffic stops.\nSpeaker 8: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Well, let's we have a motion in a second to receive and file the the report. So there is a motion in a second to do that. We've taken public comment on that item already, so please cast your votes.\nSpeaker 10: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: We have a second we have a second item here, which is to the recommended motion is that I'm making is to postpone the staff recommendation to a date in May as set by the city manager. And so there is a motion any second on that.\nSpeaker 0: Is there a public comment on that motion?\nSpeaker 10: Very good. You certainly support. Any safety measures that will ensure the safety of our airport.\nSpeaker 8: But I think one of the most inane.\nSpeaker 10: Facts. We were presented here today.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it.\nSpeaker 10: Is. We have an.\nSpeaker 8: Individual whose.\nSpeaker 10: Will be voting on this, the security issue, who the public records indicate. Almost every week demonstrates manifest. Mental instability in addition to mental instability certified. In the Long Beach police records relative to the individual arrest and have a person like that.\nSpeaker 8: Weighing in.\nSpeaker 10: On any aspect of.\nSpeaker 8: Safety at an airport. Is simply.\nSpeaker 2: Inane.\nSpeaker 10: And needs to be addressed by this council. Either tonight or in the future. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 10: Good evening, mayors, members of the council. I had some prepared remarks, but I must admit I'm somewhat confused and shocked by some of the allegations that were made here this this evening. Let's set some facts straight. The reports in the media as of late only addressed the situation if this proposal went through.\nSpeaker 10: If this proposal went through, the police department's proposal is to not have L-A. Excuse me. Long Beach police officers assigned to the airport between the hours, approximately, of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.. That's what was stated in the media, and that is what is stated in the proposal.\nSpeaker 10: It's somewhat confusing if they believe that proper security isn't available during business hours, if you will. Those would be hours between 7 a.m. and 10:59 p.m.. But after 11:00, I suppose that if somebody called 911a police unit that's traveling the the the area of the airport would respond.\nSpeaker 10: So that's what was stated in the media. Someone suggested that the reason that we're not up to 27 is because of this meet and confer that has been taking place for about a year. I've been here six years and we have never been north of 15 PSOs for the past six years.\nSpeaker 10: So it hasn't been the past few months that we have been in a meeting confer. Mr. West has an issue apparently with management not having a law enforcement background.\nSpeaker 0: Well, the fact is that for 35.\nSpeaker 10: Years there hasn't been a law enforcement overseer of the Long Beach Eso's at the airport. This has been quite well. And the reason we're here today is not because the union negotiated post training for the eso's. This was as a direct result of management.\nSpeaker 10: The city manager at that time, the city attorney at that time, and the person in charge of the airport over a quarter century ago coming to the union through a meet and confer process and asking us if it would be okay to send these folks to post training.\nSpeaker 10: Now let's talk about training. I believe that statements were made to the council that somehow training is going to be between 30 and 60 hours. This is a deficiency of the current training. The current post one training is a minimum of 660 hours.\nSpeaker 10: This is a training that was imposed by this city for these tests. Taking that away. Taking the authority away is an injustice. And that, we believe, will be a weakness of security. I am speaking going forward. I am not speaking currently.\nSpeaker 10: I also believe that the airport is safe today. I don't believe that the L4 will be safe if you reduce training from 660 hours to 30 to 60 hours. They also want to take away arrest powers, even though it was just said that they will continue arrest powers.\nSpeaker 10: No, they will continue arrest powers if they call 911. And if they call the police person, the red and the red lights will be transferred to amber lights. So there's a significant amount of information that's being withheld from this council, and I think it needs to be explored.\nSpeaker 10: I urge and recommend that an independent study of this proposal be made so that we can make an intelligent decision. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 8: And I can fe six districts stand here in support of my union brothers and sisters. I don't believe that the chain of command to be streamlined into more centralized power with the language police department. This the last time we've seen something sizable to this level was when chief of police in L.A., Mr. Bratton and then Mayor James\nSpeaker 8: Hahn were trying to do the same thing with the World LAX International Airport, which is not it's autonomous. It's an autonomous division. It's not under the LAPD. In regards to the current handling of our airport here. I think this issue is unfavorably speaking against the great job that the current CSO officers are doing in securing our airport\nSpeaker 8: , and it's undermining public morale, which is unnecessary because we have had no issues. And I'm just here to support. I, as a member of the community, am a bit suspicious of any centralization of safety in regards to our police department going under our police department.\nSpeaker 8: And also wary of what could be a very sizable contract in the future. You know, because I like to believe that the numbers alone we should report will be a huge one in the next 10 to 20 years.\nSpeaker 8: So in the short term, I think a lot of the implications of what this fact finding report is, is not speaking on is what will this look like? You know, 20 years from now, where we're talking about 12, 12 jobs.\nSpeaker 8: Right now, we're actually 27. We're talking about maybe, you know, in ten years, you know, Alex, they employ over 600 people. So what if one day that's going to be 600, you know, 324 officers there? What about in 20 years, 20, 30 years from now, when it's not just JetBlue who's the hub here, it's five other hubs\nSpeaker 8: that are here. And then we're talking about at that time, you know, obligations towards the city budget and being thrice full to accommodate police officers on the campus of the airport. So against the city, along with the police department taking over this.\nSpeaker 8: And I'm here in support of our current. So brothers and sisters. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, these are the last two speakers. And then we're we've closed the speakers list.\nSpeaker 10: Hi. My name is Dan Gonzales. I'm president of Local Large 1930 representing the Special Services peace officers at the Long Beach Airport as well. My address is on file. I'm a city employee, been here almost 24 years. Currently, I'm serving as an associate with the Port of Long Beach Harbor Patrol, and my assignments are swing ship patrol\nSpeaker 10: as well as field training for my department. First of all, I'm going to deviate from my my thing here. I'm a little concerned about the the city manager saying that you have to be a peace officer, law enforcement, to supervise law enforcement.\nSpeaker 10: Isn't he the boss of the chief? But is it? It's just confusing to me. All right. Honorable Mayor Garcia and city council members. First of all, I want to express my appreciation for the complicated, complicated task you and the council have with this issue.\nSpeaker 10: I also want to mention my appreciation for Chief Luna and the task he has to help keep this city safe. With that said, it is my belief that the direction to lessen the training standards and duties of the so peace officers assigned to the airport is misguided.\nSpeaker 10: These decisions will add to city liability and require more Long Beach police officers and ultimately cost the taxpayers more. I've been part of the meet and confer process and I am deeply disturbed by what I've seen. I've seen the Long Beach PD use its influence to convince Poste to revoke certifications from our members.\nSpeaker 10: It wasn't an audit. They didn't just decide to audit what they were doing, and it only affected our members, not the folks that passed their FTO process and went on to other agencies. Somehow that magically didn't happen. So it has only only affected I am members.\nSpeaker 10: I thought that the you know, all this was done to further the political goal of the police department. I thought the police were supposed to do what's right, not what's easy. I've seen the police department use the argument that.\nSpeaker 10: Less training for my members will increase safety. As an instructor, I tell you. Officers do not rise to the occasion. They default to the level of their training. This is why. Your organization, Long Beach PD, has a SWAT team training weekly and not hoping that they'll just figure it out and rise to the occasion.\nSpeaker 10: My first eight years with the city, I proudly worked for the Long Beach Police Department as an S.O. not and I've had lots of I still have a lot of friends there. I'm really concerned about their management and the direction towards mediocrity.\nSpeaker 10: They're looking for the bare minimum and not not exceeding and not going higher and better. I asked the council not to approve the emotion, instead direct the management team to head in a logical, ethical and safe direction. That makes sense for everyone, including the community, we all think.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you. Final speaker.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening, Mayor and city council members. My name is James Sweitzer. I am a third district resident and a proud member of the Democratic Socialists of America Long Beach chapter. So I'm also here and proud to stand in solidarity with the hardworking city employees with I Am 1930.\nSpeaker 7: So I am speaking tonight in opposition to this item. And the you know, we've heard it called multiple things, you know, labor dispute, management issue. But I want to make some observations today and call it what it is, which is a takeover, and that this is an orchestrated takeover of the airport by the Long Beach Police Department\nSpeaker 7: . And it's no secret that this has been an effort that has been going on for years and is the you know, I can't help but also wonder that we're talking about the excesses of the airport tonight. And I'm wondering about the CISOs here at City Hall.\nSpeaker 7: I'm also wondering about the Eso's, just as is mentioned at the harbor department or at the Port of Long Beach as well, and wondering what comes next. But I also believe that the track records of the airport and police department should speak for themselves.\nSpeaker 7: And the past two years, the city of Long Beach has actually done an amazing job at touting the airport's accolades and honors. And I feel like every month I'm opening up a new article in a city newsletter or in the local media about how it's the best airport.\nSpeaker 7: It's the safest airport. And I think that's something to celebrate that our Long Beach airport is a community asset and it's a source of pride for the city. But meanwhile, within the first seven months of receiving the Metro policing contract, for instance, and as somebody who regularly uses the blue line to travel to L.A., the Long Beach\nSpeaker 7: Police Department had already killed Cesar Rodriguez within those first seven months. And by 13 months into the contract, as the Long Beach Post reported, the Long Beach Police Department was responsible for more than half of all of the arrests in the metro system, despite only policing four miles of a 98 mile system.\nSpeaker 7: So I want to let that sink in, because I think that speaks for itself. And knowing all of this, I can't help but wonder why we are risking the reputation of our community asset and giving more authority to the city's biggest liability.\nSpeaker 7: So I want to put that out there as a question, and I urge you all to I appreciate postponing this, but I ultimately want to urge you to not allow this integration to happen. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We have a we have a motion in a second. I want to as we as we take the vote, I just want to say something which I think is important, is that I want to reiterate something I think everyone agrees agrees on, and that is that the Long Beach Airport is a wonderful, safe place that\nSpeaker 0: people love to travel to. And it's because of the team that is currently in place. And I personally want to thank the Palm Beach police officers that are there working every day, work really hard to keep our airport safe.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank them, Chief, the entire team, the Sasso team that is there, that work in coordination with our Long Beach Police Department and that have been doing great work. I see our CSO officers when I'm traveling in and out of the Long Beach Airport and we appreciate their work and they work alongside the TSA\nSpeaker 0: , the FBI that is doing work at the airport on a regular basis, and a lot of other agencies to make sure that we have a world class airport. And so to the entire team that is there. I just want to thank them for making the Long Beach Airport a really great, safe place to fly.\nSpeaker 0: And I will add that I appreciate whenever I go seeing our Long Beach police officers are so officers, to be very honest, always friendly, always working with folks and I think providing excellent service to the community. So thank you for the work that's been that has been happening.\nSpeaker 0: And and I want to thank everyone for for their interest, of course, in this issue. So please. Councilmembers Castro votes.\nSpeaker 2: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you very much. We're going to be moving on now to our next item here. On second.\nSpeaker 2: What's. Just. Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Let me let me just real briefly, if I can have. Hearing one. I know it's very quick. We can do that really quick so we get that out of the way.\n",

Butler is going to present on the.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect welcome, Ms.. Butler.\nSpeaker 2: Getting the Madam Mayor and members of city council. The City of Alameda lacked sufficient housing space for our unhoused residents. Staff recommends that the city use its real estate assets to provide emergency shelter for approximately 32 unhoused residents in three vacant properties located at Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 2: Staff invited to organizations, the Bay Area Community Services and Village of Love to submit a proposal to offer emergency housing at three at the three vacant properties. The two organizations were selected based on their depth of experience. Stop interviewing both organizations and found both of them to be capable of offering emergency housing.\nSpeaker 2: Staff is recommending Batts to operate the city's emergency housing program based on Box's history operating parable model and their strength of the writing proposal and their high caliber of interview responses. In addition, Batts is highly developed, has a highly developed program model that supports placement of program participants in permanent housing.\nSpeaker 2: Batts also has extensive experience successfully providing homeless housing in single family scattered dwellings throughout the Bay Area. Emergency homeless housing programing is designed to promote and support placement in permanent housing. Generally speaking, six months is a typical timeframe for a person to be housed in emergency housing.\nSpeaker 2: That period is sometimes more and sometimes less. It is particularly crucial to provide emergency housing prior to the opening of the transitional supportive housing blocks that the services will include one meal a day and food for individual meal preparation, case management, referral services, housing, navigation services, staff oversight and supportive services.\nSpeaker 2: That's will also dedicate 300,000 of its annual budget towards flexible funds used to prepare and place residents in permanent housing. Here are staff's recommendations. We're recommending that the City Council adopt a resolution establishing a budget to appropriate $2,836,047 in American rescue funds, ARPA funds to pay for the MAX contract, and 300,000 for startup costs such as furniture\nSpeaker 2: , linens, a vehicle and minor remodel and repair and minor, minor remodel and repair 2 to 3 homes. Staff further recommends that city council authorize the city manager to execute a two year agreement with banks for amount not to exceed $2,536,047.\nSpeaker 2: Finally, Staff recommends that the City Council authorize the city manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with Alameda County for heat interest funding in an amount ranging from 30000 to 45000 to help support the remodel repairs in these three housing houses.\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me. This ends by presentation.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Miss Butler. Do we have any clarifying questions from council before we go to public comment, which I assume we have public comment.\nSpeaker 0: We do.\nSpeaker 1: We do. Okay. I'm seeing none. Why don't we go to public comment?\nSpeaker 0: We only have three speakers so far. The first is Curtis Thomas.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, Speaker Thomas. Speaker Thomas, are you able to unmute?\nSpeaker 3: I'm sorry you're.\nSpeaker 2: Here. You're great here.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. I'm one of the city's residential tenants in the ranch homes, townhouses and big whites at Alameda Point. While we support assistance for unhoused individuals, it is only.\nSpeaker 4: Fair that other neighborhoods in.\nSpeaker 3: Alameda and Bay for Island besides ours bear some of the risks and externalities of the city's plan to combat homelessness and housing insecurity. Why are these efforts almost entirely concentrated in our neighborhood? We are already dealing with a large uptick in crime and quality of life issues here on the point, as a result of the city concentrating\nSpeaker 3: homeless outreach and permitting encampments in and around us. The proposed three emergency shelters to be installed in homes here housing up to 32, rotating short term adult residents at a time in the very midst of our family oriented neighborhood is cause for concern to myself and many of my neighbors, especially those with children.\nSpeaker 3: It would be far more acceptable to the current residents of this family oriented neighborhood of the city, housed families in these units. Instead, I work in affordable housing, and although the majority are well-behaved and deserving tenants, I can tell you that even in the permanent housing stage, there are outsized issues with drugs, violence, theft, psychiatric breakdowns and\nSpeaker 3: other unnaturally type behaviors. To place three emergency shelters in two of the big White Houses and one townhouse on top of allowing encampments and concentrating the bulk of the city's homeless. Outreach here is unfair to us since the city is our landlord.\nSpeaker 3: We deserve more input into this decision as intimate stakeholders. I ask that the decision be delayed until proper stakeholder input is received. If this is allowed to go through, it would be more than fair for the city to reduce our rents, to compensate us for taking.\nSpeaker 4: On a far larger share of the risks.\nSpeaker 3: And externalities than any other neighborhood in Alameda. And because reducing rents for the city's own tenants would also align with the spirit of the city's plan to alleviate homelessness and housing insecurity, thus reducing the odds that our tenants, that their own tenants become unhoused.\nSpeaker 3: We are the city's own tenants. Please prove that you care about us too.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 0: And a back test.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Speaker bagged his.\nSpeaker 2: Evening again here. And members of the City Council, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about this item, which, as you know, I definitely support.\nSpeaker 1: Any.\nSpeaker 2: And all options of housing is good for Alameda to really address the issue of homelessness in our city. I see a deliberate on this item to establish an emergency homeless housing program in the city, which I think is long overdue and I hope you will support.\nSpeaker 2: I would like to suggest a couple more items to consider. Number one, please hire more staff to run the city's social services and homeless services programs. Having one person, from my experience, to carry out existing programs to now manage some new and major projects in homeless housing.\nSpeaker 2: And by the way, this is just one of the many projects this person will be juggling with. It is not sustainable. I want to give a shout out to the community development team who are willing to drop everything to provide support to this position.\nSpeaker 2: But they have their own jobs and they also have full time for full work. So other cities similar in size in Alameda has entire teams or divisions dedicated to homelessness services. So please, I urge you to look into staffing services for social services and homeless services.\nSpeaker 2: Right. And then second, while I applaud this long overdue effort, this is a temporary solution. So please continue to work on permanent housing solutions for the unhoused. It is estimated that the government spends an average of $35,000 or more per year per person on a chronically homeless person on the streets.\nSpeaker 2: In comparison, providing permanent supportive housing costs about $12,800 per year per person on average. So, you know, it's a no brainer, I think, to to really look at a homeless permanent housing solution for the homeless. And finally, I want to thank you.\nSpeaker 2: You've always been supportive supportive of projects for our unhoused. And I urge you to continue making ending homelessness a.\nSpeaker 1: Priority in the.\nSpeaker 2: City of Alameda. So thank you for your time and for your effort in this in this really journey to end homelessness in our city.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 0: Stephanie, changed.\nSpeaker 1: Good afternoon. Speaker Is it China's hard? Welcome.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Hello, Kitty.\nSpeaker 1: We can hear you just fine. Go right ahead.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Hello. City Council members Mayor Ashcraft and city staff. I am a resident of the one of the family homes on Alameda Point. And I sent an email earlier today to each of you. And I appreciate that some of you have responded to my concerns about this project.\nSpeaker 2: However, I'd like to reiterate and elaborate on some of the points I made. First of all, as the project currently stands, this is not scattered off site housing. This is clustered housing. Alameda Point is a community with mixed housing.\nSpeaker 2: We have more than 200 units of permanent supportive housing that is wonderfully managed by the Army two point Collaborative. We have a domestic violence shelter. We have transitional housing trailers, and we have traditional family housing. And in this mix of housing, the we have seen really good outcomes from other residents who need support.\nSpeaker 2: The two point neighborhood, however, has become disproportionately burdened by the housing policies of the city. It seems like whenever we have a need for housing, the first the first stop is Alameda point. And I'm sorry. Let me that's okay.\nSpeaker 2: The newly formed unhoused encampment over as they have formed over on the estuary has increased foot traffic through the neighborhood. We are taking housing out of the rental inventory at this point. And. Excuse me. I'm sorry. So the plan is actually removing housing as it stands, as in rental, and it is not adding housing.\nSpeaker 2: The point is largely comprised of historically disenfranchized populations, and my main concern here is that there has been no community.\nSpeaker 4: Input.\nSpeaker 2: On this subject. And again, with a neighborhood that has been largely disenfranchized, it seems like this is the one neighborhood who has not been engaged in the process. Oftentimes when we've had other housing issues come up, other neighborhoods have been engaged.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm very concerned with the lack of involvement once again with Alameda Point residents. They have seen it. They have seen their voices and heard in a lot of different communities, in a lot of different venues. I think that that's I think the active dismantling of this community is going to further disenfranchize a lot of our residents\nSpeaker 2: here and it's going to entrench the segregation policies that are are are cropping up for this. The solution I. I'm going to ask the council to delay the vote on this until we can have some meaningful community dialog and let the voices of Alameda point to be heard.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: We now have.\nSpeaker 0: Reached the limit of being over seven speakers, so the time will now drop to 2 minutes per speaker. Okay. Next speaker is Dee Dee Lewis.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Speaker Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Hello? Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 1: We can.\nSpeaker 2: Well. Well, I want to just thank you all for all the hard work you are doing. Providing housing. Housing and dignity, I think, are both human rights. And there is no clear cut path to making that a reality for everyone.\nSpeaker 2: I also live on a block of Pearl Harbor, right near one of what we call the big whites that I am reading. What house? 11 kind of a rotating residency of 11 tenants going through various programs to kind of get their get themselves together and be able to find permanent housing.\nSpeaker 2: And 11 or a single family home just seems like a lot. If we've learned anything from MTV's The Real World. Even seven strangers living in a house was a whole lot of problems. And 11 just feels like we are not necessarily setting these residents up for success.\nSpeaker 2: I would love to see housing insecure families come into this neighborhood. I know through some of my work with AUC, we do have plenty of families that that would be a great fit here. I also was very excited to hear about the bottle parcel and some of that work and I'm hoping we can have some of that\nSpeaker 2: continue maybe on Bay Farm as well and kind of share it in this one. I you know, I was hearing a lot of like we're one island, we're one Alameda. And, you know, it's great that we have a lot of those services in our neighborhood, but I think it would be nice to not have all of them\nSpeaker 2: in our neighborhood. And I will see the rest of my time. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Ake you speaker Lewis our next speaker. And by the way, we don't see time. Everybody gets 2 minutes and you use it or not. But thank you. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 0: Amy Benjamin.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, speaker. Benjamin.\nSpeaker 2: Hi. I too am a resident of Alameda Point, a block away from one of the proposed sites. One of the great things about our neighborhood is that it is a very family oriented neighborhood and it is also affordable housing.\nSpeaker 2: One of the reasons that we did move here with our three children was so that we would be able it was one of the only places that we could afford to live. But it's also a childhood that they have out here, much like the eighties, where they can ride around on their bikes and they're barefoot, running from\nSpeaker 2: house to house and day and night. And I don't worry about it at all. However, I feel like if we have 11 to 13 people in a single family home directly across the street with a rotating. I don't know with rotating people coming in if they're going to be changing it up every six months because it's emergency\nSpeaker 2: housing. It's not permanent housing. These aren't people that are going to be endeared to our community or part of our community per say, because they're not going to be investing in it. I don't feel like I would have that same sense of safety.\nSpeaker 2: I don't feel like I would have that same sense of well-being. Having my children just out playing feral and free range. I think that if we had family housing here, that it would be more than welcome refugee housing more than welcome.\nSpeaker 2: But to have just people that are coming in for like a moment isn't really necessarily something that feels like it's in line with our community that we have here. And we do have a very strong community, as you can see from the letters that have been pouring in all day.\nSpeaker 2: I also would like to say just on a similar note, that the bottle parcel tax is very well thought out. I mean, having Gensler on board, having all of the things put together, having people from that staff here to talk to us was really reassuring and lovely that this doesn't feel like it's as put together.\nSpeaker 2: And I would also like to.\nSpeaker 4: Have the vote delayed en masse until there can be more discussion.\nSpeaker 2: And that's it.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you, Speaker Benjamin. Okay. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 0: Craig Mia.\nSpeaker 1: There is Mr. Myatt, right.\nSpeaker 3: That's correct, Mr. Myers. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Welcome.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Your council members and mayor. I wanted to say I'm. Redevelopment is near and dear to my heart. I'm a real estate developer and advisor. I was responsible, started revitalizing downtown San Jose, downtown L.A., Albuquerque, and also responsible architecture of the and airport commercial properties.\nSpeaker 3: I started development groups of marketing companies, and I've also gone about 100 years of single family housing throughout the Central Valley. I'm also on the board of the East Bay Overland Institute, and I'm also just been nominated as one to the state of Indiana for Project Infant Family Services as well.\nSpeaker 3: So I really care about each other and I'm also rivers and it wouldn't be much. Unfortunately, I can't support this venture because it is not fitting with the historical charter. This particular district is called a historical district and the city actually picked a color scheme so that when we change the legacy for this particular historical area and\nSpeaker 3: this area was issued for single families and should be preserved because of the policy. Number two, I don't like about this a stream segregation of services. The point I wanted to see that the transit ought to be dispersed around the city.\nSpeaker 3: I'd like to see a study done on geospatial mapping illustrating the number of units and location roughly on the Alameda. Third thing I dislike was like a lack of transparency. I just found about this yesterday. And this was like there was no public comment.\nSpeaker 3: There's no noticing in the residence. We have no idea who's actually managing the facilities or what's actually happening. I've moved in here because as a fan community, I have a daughter. I like to have my daughter play with neighbors, which should be all the families and kids not loving adults and also living in the big white 11\nSpeaker 3: people is not really nice. I've had family members over and love and time.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. Your time is up. Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 0: William Smith.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Speaker Smith.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Madam Mayor, and members of the Council. As I mentioned earlier, I've been involved for over three decades with housing in Alameda, and I've really watched how it's become an issue. We could predict predicted, but now that the predictions have come true and regarding the the housing that you're talking about for this item, it's emergency housing\nSpeaker 3: . It's not permanent housing. And so it's a contract for two years. So if it doesn't work out at this particular place, it can be revoked. And it's emergency housing. It's needed now. It's needed for people today. And so that means that we will have less consideration about some of the other things regarding concentration at Alameda Point.\nSpeaker 3: That is a problem, but it's only three, three housing units. And the place where we will really get after that is coming up later on the agenda. The housing element is affirmatively furthering fair housing and that's where things based.\nSpeaker 3: Housing opportunities are spread throughout the island and that's the place to really address that. And three units, 3 to 3 homes, one way or the other is not a major issue on for for reform, firmly furthering for housing.\nSpeaker 3: And then the other thing, what you commonly hear, we we're a family neighborhood and we only want families here. Well, that's a that's a common thing I've heard for all three decades. And we have to have places for single people.\nSpeaker 3: Many of our own kids grow up. They're not they're not married right away. They need a place to live. They need it. So we need to work in all different kinds of people and all the neighborhoods and integrate them together.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm definitely would suggest you go ahead with this, but be sure your staff at absolutely the best do a high quality job because if you don't I would be supportive of the neighborhood and turn and and closing it down in two years when it comes up for renewal.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Speaker Smith, our next speaker.\nSpeaker 0: Dennis Anderson.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, Speaker Anderson.\nSpeaker 2: Well, again, I. Okay. I do agree that the island does need to share in the responsibility to help our unhoused neighbors, but not for the reasons that some previous speakers mentioned. Alameda The entirety of Alameda is a family neighborhood.\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, I live in the East End. There's families here. There's homes here. Put it here. I don't care. But you know what? I'm hearing a lot of my neighbors on the other end of the island saying is that this, you know, offering services to unhoused people is going to bring in crime and make their kids\nSpeaker 2: unsafe. And that's not true. When people are receiving services and are receiving care, they are part of our community and they do have an investment in maintaining that community. So I'm just really disappointed to hear some of the things that I've heard from people.\nSpeaker 2: So but yeah, put it put it over here. I don't you know, I'd love to have some new neighbors and, you know, welcome to my community. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Speaker Anderson. And I just want to remind people that you are all entitled to make whatever comments you want to make. We try not to comment or disparage what anyone else said because your your comments, that's your truth and and your perspective.\nSpeaker 1: And we we value and learn from all of it. Further comments, Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 0: We have one more speaker, Josh Guyer.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Speaker Guyer.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. Me being other council members, I also note I want to echo everything that Janice and Bill said. For me, this is it's a it's the emergency housing. It's in an emergency. And so we need to make accommodations.\nSpeaker 3: I am sympathetic to people who live in an Alameda point that if it appears in their would be corrected.\nSpeaker 4: Thing, that appears that there's a lot of different kinds of services that are concentrated there. As Bill said, we're going to get to that and in.\nSpeaker 3: The next item about how to concentrate both opportunity and this amenity across the island, because that's what is required of us by affirmatively furthering fair housing. But I'm sympathetic to that. But I did want to point to one thing that I noticed at least three speakers reference and Bill running up to.\nSpeaker 4: The idea that there's a.\nSpeaker 3: Family neighborhood in that that there were there would might be people who are unlike.\nSpeaker 4: Families who would be in proximity to our families. And that would be.\nSpeaker 3: Somehow inherently wrong. I want to just as Bill said, I want to draw attention to the fact that I mean, either either people are inherently have inherent value and they have the inherent right to dignity or they don't.\nSpeaker 3: And if and what determines that and if they do, what determines that value is not whether they're a member of a family or not. People have value.\nSpeaker 4: People deserve dignity. And there's a lot.\nSpeaker 3: Unfortunately, there's a there's a lack of available dignity right now. And we we're trying to make it a little less lacking by providing housing here. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Speaker Guyer And I believe we might have another speaker.\nSpeaker 0: They just put their hand down. Sorry. Oh.\nSpeaker 1: We don't have another speaker. Okay. With that, I am going to close public comment on item seven A and council. We are going to take a little break because we've already exceeded my two hour zoom rule. And so it's 942 that's come back at 955.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Quick break. Some of us will put in eye drops and look away from your screen for a little bit. 955, we'll see you back here. Thanks, everyone. Counsel, you'll want to mute and probably turn off your cameras.\nSpeaker 1: You can just leave and log back in.\nSpeaker 3: It's.\nSpeaker 2: Hi, John. Good to see you. I think it's best to.\nSpeaker 3: It's.\nSpeaker 1: Hello? Hello.\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Laura.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: So I understand we may have a guest.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Max is here, and I believe they will. People, evil people. Death. Excellent. So Jonathan Russell Apax has joined us.\nSpeaker 1: There he is. Welcome. How are you?\nSpeaker 3: I'm doing well. How are you?\nSpeaker 1: Great. Let me just check in with our city clerk. Madam Clerical studio's count. I've got one, two, three, four, five. Okay. And we've got a city manager. City manager? Hello, city attorney. We've got. Okay, man. Everybody just keeps moving around.\nSpeaker 1: So are we. Are you ready to go, Madam Clerk?\nSpeaker 0: Yes, we are.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Welcome back, everyone. We are back from our break. And so we and we finished our public comment. We are very fortunate to have been joined by Jonathan Russell of Facts, which is Bay Area Community Services. I just want to introduce yourself, Mr. Russell, that will make him available for any council questions or counsel.\nSpeaker 1: We could vote to give Mr. Russell 5 minutes to give an overview of his program. And I'm going to assume that you were listening to the previous discussion and could perhaps address some of the concerns. Councilmember Spencer, Jesse, Angela.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I'm happy to make a motion to give him 5 minutes, I guess.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And that's the second by Councilmember Knox, who I.\nSpeaker 3: Think.\nSpeaker 1: Perfectly had a motion, had a second, maybe. We have a quick roll call vote, please.\nSpeaker 0: Rotation.\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Or a spencer. I next like.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 1: She's there somewhere.\nSpeaker 0: He is. She's there. She's just juggling. So we can we can skip the.\nSpeaker 2: I'm an I, and.\nSpeaker 1: I think we've got a majority, so.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let's.\nSpeaker 1: Let's go ahead and start. Thank you. All right, welcome, Mr. Russell. In 5 minutes, tell us everything we need to know.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you so much, Madam Mayor. And council members. My name is Jonathan Russell. I'm the chief strategy officer for Bay Area Community Services. Just briefly, I have the five, ten, 15, 30 minute version, so I'll I'll do the five minute max is a we are a nonprofit provider rooted in Alameda County founded in 1953 in Oakland as\nSpeaker 4: a group of 12 concerned churches came together and said, we want to provide for the needs of our community long before things like social services existed in any government sector form and really have evolved from that rooted, community based place.\nSpeaker 4: We are now a large nonprofit that provides 40 plus programs across the behavioral health spectrum and homeless and housing services in seven counties. Again, most deeply rooted in Alameda County. Here as a chief strategy officer, my job is spending a lot of time on council meetings like this and also working with lovely city staff like Lois and\nSpeaker 4: Lisa and Veronica to develop interventions that work and address and end homelessness. And so back as an agency, we provide a lot of homeless services. We serve over 17,000 people a year across all of our programs and housed thousands of people a year across our programs as well.\nSpeaker 4: So we are deeply deep believers in a housing first model and a harm reduction model and in a dignified, uplifting and empowering approach to our community experiencing houseless mess. So this program is unique in that it is located in a scattered site, kind of in large home setting, which Backes is also familiar with.\nSpeaker 4: We operate about 300 units of scattered site housing in neighborhoods across Alameda County, single family homes, the majority of those permanent housing. But we've also operated an interim way. This interim housing program model is also a model that we've been operating since 2013.\nSpeaker 4: Now in eight programs that serve over 800 people a year across those programs all together. Now, now that we have eight and eight different cities, all working with local jurisdictions, all deeply committed to doing not just interim work, but housing that turns into permanent housing.\nSpeaker 4: So we've been very fortunate to be able to have 80% on average of the folks served in these interventions, transitioned to permanent housing from interim housing, which, if you know anything about the numbers, is is pretty good. It's so we we we joke that not joke, but we make it clear we don't operate emergency shelter.\nSpeaker 4: It's not just about the shelter and rest of it, it's about a housing pathway. So we have had we have housed over 1500 people through this intervention alone since launching these programs that have really grown since 2018. We have an interim housing program in Berkeley and Hayward and Fremont, two in Oakland just to name the Alameda County\nSpeaker 4: program. So happy to talk more, understand the community concerns. We are deep believers that it is about seeing our unhoused neighbors as part of our community. And so how can we address everyone's concerns? Work to destigmatize and work to provide the supports we know we need.\nSpeaker 4: I do want to just lift up one community member comment that I think is critical for all of us to realize, and the evidence bears it out. When we provide services, we don't bring problems, we alleviate them. When we provide and wraparound folks in our community, we alleviate problems for businesses, not create.\nSpeaker 4: And so I do just want to say, you know, these these are complicated issues, but these are our neighbors and these are models that work. And I'm not just saying that because because Max is involved. I'm saying that because I just I appreciate the community's commitment to providing the services.\nSpeaker 4: And we deeply believe that the neighborhood is the best place to do so. And so a model, though unique, that is not a big single project that's over there in this industrial park or what have you, which very often, as we all know, sometimes emergency shelters are there is there is value in doing this in a community\nSpeaker 4: , in a neighborhood setting. And it's an opportunity for us to wrap around and be a part of that process of transformation and destigmatizing. So that's my that's my impromptu representation. Happy to take any questions or talk more specifically about the service model and anything else there in.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Mr. Russell, you did a good job of sticking to your 5 minutes. Among the concerns we heard from residents is that some of them are just learning about this. This concept wasn't communicated to them ahead of time.\nSpeaker 1: So we can't turn the clock back. But now that we're here and assuming we have the opportunity to move forward, how will backs work with the neighbors? What is your communication model for? For neighbors? Because I think our our speakers raised some very valid concerns.\nSpeaker 1: And go ahead, Lisa. Maxwell. Ms..\nSpeaker 4: Maxwell? Yes. I'd like to be a Navy admiral, please. We have scheduled a community meeting to to share ideas and get questions on the 29th of this month at 6 p.m. at the club. We have that space preserved, so we'll send out further information.\nSpeaker 4: It's already on the city's website. So that'll be our initial offering.\nSpeaker 3: And opportunity to.\nSpeaker 4: Engage with the community. We can certainly do that again if folks feel like another would be warranted.\nSpeaker 2: I also understand from Mr. Russell and he can.\nSpeaker 4: Elaborate on this if you'd like, that once.\nSpeaker 2: The.\nSpeaker 4: Assuming that we go too far with this program, the community members would have easy access to reach.\nSpeaker 2: Out to backs.\nSpeaker 4: If something arose that they found to their disliking and wanted to communicate a concern. So there will be a continued line of communication between the service providers and the community members.\nSpeaker 1: Maybe Mr. Russell can amplify that. When when was that meeting scheduled?\nSpeaker 4: It's on the 29th.\nSpeaker 1: Right. But when was it?\nSpeaker 4: We just played it together because I wanted to have an opportunity to address concerns. Until we got through this evening, we weren't sure we had a program. So we will move forward with that.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So we will. Well, look forward to hearing more about that. So. Back to Mr. Russell. So Ms.. Maxwell mentioned that Access 24 seven for neighbors who have concerns or questions.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, absolutely. I think probably we again, we believe deeply that this is a community conversation. And so it needs to be a community investment, not that everyone's kicking in, you know, physical dollars do it, but value and commitment to the process.\nSpeaker 4: And that comes through conversation. So we definitely want to make ourselves.\nSpeaker 3: Available and.\nSpeaker 4: Ongoing. If this were to move forward and backs was the operator to ongoing concerns. We do provide 24 hour services for emergencies and for residents. I don't I don't know if I have a 24 hour line for you.\nSpeaker 4: I want to talk about this thing at 3 a.m., but definitely will have an avenue in which to ask those questions and be accessible to to make available ourself both individually and in a group space, in a neighborhood meeting space to talk through these things.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not sure I understand you, but if a neighbor I understand from reading the staff report that there will be someone overnight on on these properties. And I assume that someone who is staying awake and overseeing things as opposed to also being asleep.\nSpeaker 1: But if a neighbor were concerned about some issue arising, some perceived serious issue arising out of one of these properties. Could they not access someone from Baxter? Who would they call? Are they call community development? Anyone can chime in here on staff.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. I mean, we certainly will have that stuff. And so it could structure it. I'm more bit like, Hey, I want to have a meeting and talk about this and stuff like that. That is, is probably a business hours thing, but definitely we will have staff that is doing 24 hour services on site and I think certainly\nSpeaker 4: could make that available through through either reaching out directly to us as a service provider in the midnight hour or of course, if it's an emergency or a crisis or reaching.\nSpeaker 3: Out to crisis response as well.\nSpeaker 4: But I defer to the city on that.\nSpeaker 2: There will be a staff person in each house 24 hours a day. If there is an immediate emergency there, that person could address that.\nSpeaker 3: Right.\nSpeaker 4: And awake as as bright new risk.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And again, this is a concern coming from a neighbor. Is there a phone number? Is there more to be determined?\nSpeaker 2: There will.\nSpeaker 4: Be. We can share phone numbers that will cause the that the will allow people access facts. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Emergency concern.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. Okay. Council members questions. Comments. Councilor SAC.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I think what was very helpful was the contract that was provided. And I just want to make something clear in the contract on the services that is going to be provided. There's a section called program noncompliance protocols and a basis for a discharge from the facility includes.\nSpeaker 4: The first bullet point is possession of weapons. The third bullet point is assault or other violent behavior. The fourth bullet point is theft. The fifth bullet point is destruction of property. So those bullet points when we're talking about a thought, assault and theft.\nSpeaker 4: Are we talking about and the destruction of property? How are we talking about that? Does it have to be proven in a court of law? I mean, how is it going to be? And and if the assaults or thefts are against not fellow clients, but against neighbors, how how how is this taken into account?\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Great question. So the the.\nSpeaker 4: Noncompliance protocol, again, and this is sort of a process we use across all of all of these programs that that do this intervention, that provide these services, of course, as written is relative to events internal to the program that we would then manage the investigation, which would be, you know, bringing all parties to the table in terms\nSpeaker 4: of what happened, including witnesses, including staff, including the rest. And if it was determined that there was violence or serious threat of violence, for example, as one of the things you selected, then we would develop a discharge plan in which to find another opportunity quickly and sometimes immediately, depending on the level of risk and the level of\nSpeaker 4: need for that individual. So that's kind of an internal to the program, not at the court of law, but certainly at the back senior leadership with all relevant parties giving voice to and doing that internal investigation relative to.\nSpeaker 4: I think that we would definitely want to hold the same standard relative to outside that particular home community, the broader neighborhood community. But that would, I think, the determination around if it was something like that, that would need to involve the, you know, the local authorities to the area that they are in the sense that we don't\nSpeaker 4: have purview into ourselves over over all of those issues. But we would certainly hold the same standard and the same sort of compliance standard, regardless of who it was impacting in the community in terms of the program or otherwise.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Hey, other questions, comments, Councilmember Spencer and then Councilmember Knox. Right.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. So my first question is, will this house alameda unhoused. It's that 100%. That's the plan.\nSpeaker 1: You want to explain why this max time is better?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'd be happy to.\nSpeaker 4: The reason being that we are using ARPA funds and that those funds do not come with a obligation to go through the county's system or to house folks outside of the city. So our priority and our focus will be our own Alameda research.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Will there be any general fund moneys used for this? ARPA funds are being used for this. No, no, not at this point. Thank you. The community outreach. So I appreciate that. This organization, your organization has been around since 1953 and is community based.\nSpeaker 2: Why has there not been any meetings with neighbors to date?\nSpeaker 1: Ms.. Maxwell, do you want to take that?\nSpeaker 4: I'd be happy to. Yes. We were not sure that we actually had a program to discuss with them. We wanted to make sure that we had city council buy in. And as I mentioned, we've got one scheduled for the 29th, so we can take that feedback.\nSpeaker 2: So my concern with that is that's after the vote. So I'm not quite sure how what the point is of reaching out to the neighbors after we have voted on this. This is not I thought we were being asked to vote to approve the program today.\nSpeaker 4: We are asking for that. Councilmember Smith Spencer, I apologize if I interrupted you slightly.\nSpeaker 2: And during our community.\nSpeaker 4: Meetings, my understanding would be we were going to get feedback. And if that allowed us to in any way tweak or modify our program to deal with some of the concerns we could possibly consider those options. There was some suggestion that we could work work in.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So we did hear from members of the community of concerns of having 11 and they may be wrong on the numbers is that 11 people per home. That's correct. It is 10 to 11.\nSpeaker 4: We spoke with two potential service providers. They both came up with the exact same number of folks that they would be interested in serving in that environment. They will configure the rooms to be shared. And although this is not considered current, this is not considered to be, you know, dorm style housing.\nSpeaker 4: And in fact, Max was permitted to continue operating a comparable program during the pandemic by the county. They do observe protocols for COVID safety, and they do space folks out in rooms. Some of the rooms in these homes are pretty large.\nSpeaker 4: So it will just depend on the size of the room. But they also intend to use the living room as a additional sleeping area in order to maximize so we can serve.\nSpeaker 2: So my understanding is these houses have three bedrooms. Do any of them have four or five bedrooms? How many bedrooms are in these?\nSpeaker 4: The two. What we refer to as the big lights each have four. And then they obviously tend to use the living room. So that provides for that. There's multiple opportunities. There would definitely be a little less amount, less people in the townhome.\nSpeaker 4: It just has three bedrooms.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But if it's five, if it's four plus one rooms and we and you're going to house 11 people or ten people believe it's five and four. Excuse me. So is it two people per room, though, or is it sometimes three?\nSpeaker 4: It's from typically two, I think there could be a possible occasionally three, but I think two is going to be the preference. The living room, though, is a little larger. So the reason I'm hesitating is I think that may be or the additional person.\nSpeaker 3: Could.\nSpeaker 4: Potentially be because they could be spaced out adequately and not in that area.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Russell, is there anything you want to add?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, I think that the living room could provide a space where it could actually be it's a very large space about the size of the house I live in right now. And so that could be split up into even two rooms itself.\nSpeaker 4: So our goal would be to have appropriate distancing with two to a room. And if that remained, one large single space would be more spacious than some of the individual or smaller groups by having three people. So that would kind of be a let's design it out and see what the best amount of space is potentially for\nSpeaker 4: the living room.\nSpeaker 2: And then where is the person that is the supervisor? Are they one of the 11 people?\nSpeaker 4: So they're not living onsite, they're working three shifts a day. And so the staff are working between and in the home. So there's additional space that goes beyond the living quarters in which both for staff to operate and to be shared space for folks in the dining room, which would be a kind of common living space and\nSpeaker 4: an additional space in, in, in the rest of the home. So the onsite staff would be not in anyone's bedroom. They would be operating in the common space. And the majority of the services are community based. So our care coordinators, which are doing the case management, developing the housing plans, would be working with folks in the community\nSpeaker 4: as they plan their transitions, and that would be, of course, the services during the daytime hours.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. So we also heard preferences for families, some sort of families. Do you have back? I think there was a speaker who works with the school district. Do you have accommodations for families in any of these homes?\nSpeaker 4: I can address that question.\nSpeaker 1: Of Maxwell Place.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we have we heard that concern.\nSpeaker 4: Earlier from both the community as well as the council members. And we investigated that little to the extent that we had and we and we spoke to that executive director backs to the extent that we had say three families we could potentially is one of the townhomes for families that's that's not out of the range of possibility\nSpeaker 4: . However we also spoke to Operation Dignity non story building as is most familiar with our current unhoused population. And they are of the opinion that based on their experience that we don't really have a great.\nSpeaker 2: Number of.\nSpeaker 4: Truly unhoused families in Alameda. And the perspective of the school district is slightly different because the mayor can slip into laws and parameters for what constitutes homelessness for difference. That means they could potentially be house service accounts or things that they have a roof.\nSpeaker 2: Over their head.\nSpeaker 4: But to serve classically homeless, truly unhoused individuals, if we're looking for families that are not terribly many in Alameda, but we can leave that possibility open.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So this will be three homes with each with approximately 11 people living there as individual adults, it sounds like. And I think the three homes are within I'm going to say, I don't know. What is the distance that you think?\nSpeaker 2: All three? I think it's about a half a mile. That sounds about right to me. So then I'm going to swing back to what other examples does Backes have of having three homes within a half mile of each other?\nSpeaker 2: You 11 individuals each.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Russell going to take that?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. So we operate this interim housing program of varying sizes. We have programs that are currently operating with a census of 25 all the way up to programs that are operating with the census of 160. None of those current programs have the exact configuration that this program would have, though comparable census, comparable room arrangements and what have\nSpeaker 4: you. So the the we do not operate the current equivalents in terms of the where these houses sit in the neighborhood. I will say of the current non interim housing scattered site programs that we operate that are permanent housing of which we operate well over 20 homes in Alameda County of permanent housing.\nSpeaker 4: Some that have existed, I'm happy to say, since the 1970s and have been continuous operation with folks that are formerly homeless living in those homes do some of those are well within a half mile of each other and some further beyond.\nSpeaker 4: And there's a team that works and provides the scattered site services across all of those homes. So it's certainly something you've operated.\nSpeaker 3: For decades.\nSpeaker 4: Now. Well, before I was on this earth in some of those cases.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. That's all the questions. Well, actually, so there were multiple requests that we delay the item and have the community outreach first. Is there a reason why the decision needs to be made tonight as opposed to after having the community outreach meeting?\nSpeaker 3: I would be.\nSpeaker 4: Happy to take that one. My. I believe their agency is around the fact that we don't currently have a single mentor for unhoused community members. And we were trying to move expeditiously to create an opportunity to house some of these folks, particularly since we're in the bad weather months.\nSpeaker 4: And our goal was to try to roll the houses online and make the available for people to move into probably one after the other one in particular is far closer to being ready and together. It's been a little bit more of a step up.\nSpeaker 4: So honestly, the goal, the urgency, and it's just around trying to help as quickly.\nSpeaker 2: As we can. So which one is the closest to being ready? Do you know?\nSpeaker 4: One of the big whites. And I don't remember the address of it.\nSpeaker 2: I don't remember the address either.\nSpeaker 3: It's what.\nSpeaker 4: One of the two big lies. So I believe it's on Pearl Harbor and I could be wrong.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then currently the amount of so these and I think these have all been rented recently and have just recently become vacant. So what is the average rents that the city has been receiving for these properties?\nSpeaker 4: I believe that the big lights are approximately 20 $800 a month. I calculated the total and it came to around 80,000 a year for the three homes and only the one is currently in a condition ready to be rented.\nSpeaker 2: The one on. And it is on Pearl Harbor.\nSpeaker 4: Oh, thank you. The other two would need to go through a bit of a tight air before they would be available.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then we also receive complaints about from people who are current renters in the big lights of those homes have not been maintained that the city has actually done a really poor job of maintaining those homes. And and we heard tonight from a speaker that seems to think that they should get a reduction in their rent\nSpeaker 2: of 15%. What does the city seem to think about offering a reduction in rent to those homes?\nSpeaker 1: So I just want to double check with the city attorney. Do you have any advice for us on discussing rent reduction?\nSpeaker 3: I am assuming the council member is asking this to understand the amount of rent that is being foregone in these opportunities. Is that correct, Councilmember?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: I as long as the council member is considering the amount of rent being foregone as part of the analysis, and I think minimal questions in that area probably complies with the Brown Act.\nSpeaker 1: So asking about the possibility of reducing current residents rent comes into that scope.\nSpeaker 3: I am assuming the council member is trying to understand how much rent revenue is. Rent is at stake for for approving this item. Is that right, Councilmember Spencer?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Well, we heard from a speaker that raised the concern. Also, there have been multiple comments online of the loss of revenue to the city. And how does that then how can we afford this program and other programs?\nSpeaker 3: And so my advice would be that, you know, questions would be tailored to how revenues would be lost if this program went forward versus, you know, continuing to rent out the rooms, you know, instead of going forward with the program.\nSpeaker 3: I think that would stay within the agenda.\nSpeaker 2: If staff doesn't want to question, I'm fine with it. I can ask another. So I'm sorry, Miss MacLeod. Did you want to offer anything?\nSpeaker 4: I was just going to share that. The rent range that I just was looking back at my notes is more like 28 to 30 $800 a month. And I have an I understand from my high you are asset management professional that we are somewhat below market currently.\nSpeaker 4: And so I know that you know, she would probably have some concerns. I don't put words in her mouth about a further rent reduction, but I know that she doesn't think we're right on mark at this moment.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But earlier I thought the answer is that the city would be losing approximately 80,000 from the rent revenues from these three units. But if it's 20 to 3800 per month, and I think it actually for three units is actually higher than 80,000 lost revenue.\nSpeaker 2: And sounds.\nSpeaker 4: Like you're.\nSpeaker 2: Correct. So does the city know what the last rent was for each of these units?\nSpeaker 4: I don't have. That's not my head. I can certainly get that information for you. I think two of them, like I said, haven't been immediately rented. They're sitting for a little bit.\nSpeaker 2: And then does the city have any other properties across the island other than. And we heard concerns about that. Could we as a city have housing across the island where it can stop filling when when a property becomes vacant, that then it can decide that it's going to put this housing in it?\nSpeaker 4: None that I'm aware of, which is why we were attempting to utilize this opportunity, because it's a rare thing for us to have homes that we already own that could be potentially used for this opportunity. There wasn't really an intention to cluster the things on the West End.\nSpeaker 4: It just happens to be where we have assets.\nSpeaker 2: So does the city have homes anywhere other than the base? No, we don't. Not to our knowledge.\nSpeaker 4: No, not that I'm aware of at all. I don't believe so.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: I'll just throw in that. The idea of a housing trust that we've talked about.\nSpeaker 2: Before.\nSpeaker 1: Is something that would allow a city to buy up, say, a foreclosed property or a property for sale at a good rate anywhere in the city and use it for such purposes. Other cities have done this. We don't have a housing trust yet.\nSpeaker 1: I think I saw councilwoman actually. Did you have your hand up second and then we'll go to you, Councilmember. Okay, Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 3: That's why I didn't think I want to start my start my comments with a discussion I have with the city attorney, which is that I did want to notice that unbeknownst to me, my son announced that Max hired him on Friday afternoon, which we are very happy and proud of.\nSpeaker 3: In making that announcement, there are no financial we have to determine there are no financial recusals required. And I'm going to continue in this conversation. But I did want to but I did not need to. I wanted to put that out there just so that it would stick out there in the open.\nSpeaker 3: My comments are pretty short. I actually came into this meeting generally having no comments other than that. I think it sounds like a great program that I'm excited to support. I do want to pick up on Councilmember Hirsch Spencer's concerns about the outreach not having been done ahead of time.\nSpeaker 3: I will acknowledge that we are pushing staff to move forward as fast as possible to address homelessness and whatnot. And sometimes we drop balls and make mistakes, whether by thinking we'll do it later and whatnot. I'm going to say it just for the neighbors listening.\nSpeaker 3: I think this is an effort. This is one where I think we did not do this right. That said, I also think that we can move forward, work with some good neighbor, good neighbor agreements. And I know there's a city meeting set up to kind of discuss what that can look like.\nSpeaker 3: And I continue to be supportive of moving this forward. I do also want to say to the conversations, because we've had a number of the conversations about these, you know, where are a lot of these things happening and why do they end up in the West?\nSpeaker 3: We have done the city inventory. We discussed it maybe a month ago here at the council, maybe six weeks ago. We also have given direction to staff to start looking more proactively at how we can find sites and make sites available in the future.\nSpeaker 3: It will likely take money, but I did want to see it continues to come up as there is a concern among speakers who come. We are aware that right now because of the Navy leaving, we have a lot of available things that we can use that that give us opportunities to move quickly when we have our few\nSpeaker 3: quickly years late, when we have a housing crisis and the ARPA money gives us that opportunity. And so, you know, we can be aware that, yes, things are landing maybe a little bit more heavily than we would choose if we had more options on on the West End.\nSpeaker 3: But we are also giving our staff direction to really start finding ways to help move things east as well so that, you know, all of our neighbors, our neighborhoods are being provided the services for our unhoused and folks needing support.\nSpeaker 3: So thank you very much and thank you for for this work.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, you're muted, Mayor.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. I'm muted, counselor. I guess you're next.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Continuing on questions again, I think we should focus on the agreement, the contract that we are being asked to enter into. So again, focusing on the services, which is Exhibit A under a site management. There's a bullet point that states bullet point any complaints received from the business community?\nSpeaker 4: Including but not limited to the businesses adjacent to the site or in the general vicinity. That bullet point would be a thing that the provider has to immediately notify the city about if there's any complaints. Now, is there any reason why we can't include residents?\nSpeaker 4: That bullet point just focuses on business community. So that's a question.\nSpeaker 1: I'm only laughing because I emailed that same question. Council member.\nSpeaker 4: Good catch again. Same thing. Bullet point provider agrees to immediately notify the city should any of the following a clearer bullet point violence or credible threats against staff or other program clients. Again. What if there is violence or credible threats against residents?\nSpeaker 4: Shouldn't the service provider notify the city? Final question, and this is more to the city. Once we get a series of these notices, what then? Okay. Thank you. The first two questions were for the provider. The last question was for the staff.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, Mr. Russell. Do you understand, Mr. Council, everyday folks questions.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, we'd be. We'd be happy to. To the degree that we have the ability to to sort of determine that community affecting relationship, obviously the presumption, again, thinking internal to our purview within the program or to business, just generally defaulting to those those relationships in which there's an effect on adjacent business.\nSpeaker 4: I think we could apply that same principle to whatever the surrounding community is to the degree that we're aware and able to confirm. But even in unconfirmed cases like this has arisen, looks like it needs to be investigated.\nSpeaker 4: That investigation would need to include those that have authority relative to the neighborhood. And we would manage and comply from from bringing whatever program related information that we need to bear. So happy to do so. I think that some of that is the boilerplate language that needs to be rightfully modified.\nSpeaker 4: And thank you for looking down to the letter of the contract, contract and the staff.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 4: What do you do with the information?\nSpeaker 1: Give me 1/2. Councilor Harry Spencer. Miss Maxwell or Miss Butler. Did you want to?\nSpeaker 4: Certainly. I was just going to suggest that as to the contract, if counsel is inclined this evening to give instruction to proceed, we could we could include potentially direction to modify the contract to address those concerns of counsel and based on their excellent concerns.\nSpeaker 4: We could also potentially make sure that we have an opportunity for parting ways to the extent that you know, things where we're going poorly with the program and we had an excessive amount of complaints that we could have a conversation about specifically with that look.\nSpeaker 2: And it looks like.\nSpeaker 4: Just a couple of suggestions for the contract.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I want to just hear from councilmembers we haven't heard from yet. And I see the vice mayor's hand. Is that the vice mayor of l.a. And then we'll go back to councilmember spencer. And I should ask, though, how some of our days are.\nSpeaker 1: You did have the floor. Had you finished all your comments and questions, you were okay. Okay. Back to you guys. Me Mavela.\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, I think we've kind of raised a number of questions about what would it cost? And it looks like on the on the upper side of things, it could cost that we would be potentially foregoing around $45,000 a year worth of rent or something like that per unit.\nSpeaker 2: But right now, these are three units that are currently not being rented, meaning that we're already forgoing the rental income on these units. And I think, you know, I mean, this is and then my second term on council and I remember during my first term, we had a number of folks that were coming to meetings saying, you've\nSpeaker 2: got all these empty houses at only two points. Why can't you use those to, you know, as housing or affordable housing or emergency housing? And now we're trying to do that and we're hearing, no, not there. And I think, you know, I certainly would have liked that we had done that.\nSpeaker 2: We had we would have done the outreach ahead of time with the neighbors and those folks that are in the vicinity. I think that that's really important work to do. I would like to see that, you know, I'm glad we have one meeting scheduled.\nSpeaker 2: I hope we can also schedule additional meetings if we need to, to allow for opportunities for questions and answers. But I also want to flag the fact that. You know, for years there have been suggestions that we do exactly what we're proposing to do.\nSpeaker 2: We just now have the funding to do it, and we also have the open units that are going to be in a place that are suitable and habitable. And I think the other thing is we've sat through meetings where we've asked how many people need emergency housing, and we know that that number is very high and it's\nSpeaker 2: growing. We also have asked at other meetings how much we're spending when we have, for instance, an air quality issue, when we when we buy hotel vouchers. And this actually gives us units in the city of Alameda. It gives us beds in the city of Alameda for these emergency needs.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that this is so critical and I'm sitting here, I've got the heater on in my house. You know, I've got and we're starting to see the weather change. It's getting colder out. We're seeing we have the with the atmospheric river occurring.\nSpeaker 2: This is really an opportunity to make sure that we have those emergency beds available for people who reside in the city of Alameda. I also flagged the similar things in the in the contract. And, you know, I don't necessarily think we have to say that issues raised by residents, but perhaps just we can just keep it general\nSpeaker 2: and say neighbors or people within the vicinity. You know, I also want to note that we have in the contract requirements to keep documents, to keep reports that that information should be made available to the city, that those are official records.\nSpeaker 2: I mean, there are significant reporting requirements that are that are part of this contract, I think. And, you know, I think our staff perhaps could could make and or create an opportunity for a review if there is some sort of incident that's documented.\nSpeaker 2: And you know, I think that there this is really an opportunity where we're kind of I think there's an opportunity for us to really come together as a community around these units. And so, you know, I think that that that I would like to see that happen.\nSpeaker 2: I would like to see community buy in. I think these meetings are a good start and really allowing for space for us to have this conversation as a broader community. So I want to put that out there. I understand I know some of the folks, some of my friends live live out there.\nSpeaker 2: And so I understand that the issues that they're that are that they are raising. But I also know that these are very compassionate individuals. And if we sit down and speak with them and really engage folks, we can get to a place where where we can we can add these beds and we can do it without delay\nSpeaker 2: . So I'm ready to support tonight provided that we set up an opportunity for that community input and not just limited to the one meeting and that we make some some tweaks to the the contract being proposed.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you both very well. I can't, however, decide.\nSpeaker 4: Two questions. First question is, is there any reason why we can't move ahead with one of the three in the first year and judge its performance, then move with the second and third? If, if, if? Is there any reason why we can't do that?\nSpeaker 3: Question.\nSpeaker 1: I a miss Maxwell.\nSpeaker 4: I would ask if Mr. Russell could assist with that, because I have some concerns that the economy is a scale, one that would make one home operation of one home of interest backs. I question that, and I don't know the answer to it.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. I think we I think we would just need to look at what that what that would look like operationally in terms of the economies of scale, sort of to to invest the infrastructure to operate the project. It certainly is the volume that creates, I think, the the efficiencies, the economic efficiencies and which is to say nothing\nSpeaker 4: of the sort of community impact relative to the need. But that's it. That's of course a separate determination. So I think that would be looking at the at the ability there to do so and then what the what the cost difference would be in that.\nSpeaker 4: I think there would be just from, you know, as any business model small you have you have an inherent staff that you have to have no matter how big it is. And then you you scale up incrementally from there in some cases.\nSpeaker 4: So it would just be looking at the cost structure and the impact. And I think but we're happy to have whatever conversation that the council would direct with city staff if.\nSpeaker 3: There was determination along those lines and.\nSpeaker 4: See what that looks like. Thank you, Mr. Russell. A second question. The second question for staff is, could we actually put together language that kind of says, you know, all these notifications that we're getting relative to what I just referenced, those sets of bullet points, you know, what is the could we actually put language tonight that says\nSpeaker 4: what is the level, the threshold level at which we would have to make some serious decisions in terms of go, no go or or does that have to take some more time? I would suspect it has to take some more time to put together.\nSpeaker 4: But that's a question for staff, legal staff or program staff.\nSpeaker 2: I believe.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, I don't know that we can do it on the fly, this thing. I think it's a very doable request. I think we could come up with language that gave us the opportunity to make an election. The program wasn't working in this location to the extent we had a, you know, an agreed upon amount of material\nSpeaker 4: problems. But I think we'd have to craft language, and that would certainly be the assistance of Mr. Sharon's office. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: I know. I see the vice mayors had it, but Councilmember Harry Spencer's had her hand up for a while. So let me take you first, Councilmember Harry Spencer, and then we'll go to.\nSpeaker 2: The vice mayor. Thank you. So I did want to follow the members of the contract language. And just at the beginning and it's towards the end of the contract has what the noncompliance protocols are. But for those that are listening on TV, I want to say it says only the following reasons may be used as a basis\nSpeaker 2: for discharge from a facility. And the first one is possession of a weapon at the facility as opposed to possession of a weapon, not at the facility. And it continues similar to that possession of illegal drugs on the premises.\nSpeaker 2: However, apparently possession of illegal drugs not on the premises is not you may not be removed from the facility for that. So I think it is important that, in fact, I agree with I, I believe I've heard at least from a couple of council members that this contract provides that outside of the facility, we also would not\nSpeaker 2: want people having possession of a weapon, possession of illegal drugs, assault or violent behavior, theft, etc.. So I think that contract should be modified before or before we approve this item. I also do think it's important to have the meeting prior to agreeing to this and having community input.\nSpeaker 2: I think that the rents could actually be higher than what staff has provided tonight, and I think that these homes, at least one of them has been rented very recently and is just not. The city has not rented it out and is holding it here.\nSpeaker 2: But I would make a motion that we delay this decision until the next council meeting, which is immediately after the meeting with the public, which is is it's not that far away. It's already December, I believe the date is December six, which is then following the community outreach meeting.\nSpeaker 2: And at that time, I think this contract could be sorted out. I think the and and I don't think it is at all appropriate to proceed without the community outreach first. I think it's unfortunate that this has been brought to us without that.\nSpeaker 2: I really in regards to staff's comments that we didn't know we were going to have the project or not, so we didn't meet with the public in advance moving forward. And I think it's always important to reach out to them first before it comes here so that then we they get to be part of the process.\nSpeaker 2: They get to have their questions answered in advance. And it doesn't really put us in this position of hearing from so many people that they felt like they were excluded from the process. So I do move that. We bring this item back at the first next council meeting.\nSpeaker 2: Outreach.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So we have had a motion to continue this item or bring it back in December. Do we have a second?\nSpeaker 4: I'll second. It was comment.\nSpeaker 3: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 4: But I could I could wait to comment because I think Vice Mayor Vella wanted a question questionnaire.\nSpeaker 1: Well, we're going to have a if we don't have a second, we're going to move on. Okay. Discussion. Do we have discussion or should we just take a vote? Okay. Discussion. Councilmember Desai.\nSpeaker 4: My discussion is this. I think that this is a project that we can all be very, very proud of. I think 11 per unit is a little too high. But but to the extent that we tighten the contract, I'm willing to do it.\nSpeaker 4: I'm willing to try. We are in that housing crisis. But but I agree with Councilmember Herrera and that maybe we should kind of, you know, as they say in sewing measure twice before we cut once. So I think maybe a delay until next council meeting would be in order to deal with kind of the range of issues\nSpeaker 4: , contractual issues that we waste on. So that's why I'm sticking.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Any further discussion? Let's have a roll call. Madam Vice Mayor, please. You.\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, I think this this point is not necessary, hasn't necessarily been highlighted enough. But we have over 200 individuals as of our last point in time count that do not have housing in the city of Alameda.\nSpeaker 2: That is 200 people that are being forced to sleep and shelter outdoors that we are we are saying, you know what, we need to we're going to go ahead and wait. Even though we identified in our five year strategic plan just a month ago, we reiterated and passed that plan and we said this is a priority.\nSpeaker 2: And so I just think we are saying these things from the safety and security and warmth of our own homes or our city. You know, all of us are housed and have housing here in Alameda. And I just I yes, I think it's important that we have these conversations with the neighbors.\nSpeaker 2: I think that we need to make sure that we have a contract. I do not want to delay this. And so that's why I'm not going to be supporting this motion tonight. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: If I could stop you, because we're going to have to take now. We'll get back to you, Vice Mayor. We've got to we've got to do a quick roll call vote here, and then we have to do a housekeeping vote because it's coming on 11:00, believe it or not.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. We've had a motion. We've had a second. I'm sure there's no more discussion because we need to take a quick roll call vote. And Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 0: So I.\nSpeaker 3: Am.\nSpeaker 0: I said, sir.\nSpeaker 2: Hi.\nSpeaker 0: Max.\nSpeaker 3: Right now.\nSpeaker 2: Avella. Now.\nSpeaker 0: Mayor, as you.\nSpeaker 2: Know.\nSpeaker 0: The motion fails 2 to 3.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Okay, Council what? We have to decide and we got to do it quickly because at 11:00 we all turned into pumpkins. But we've got to. So whoever said we were going to get through this whole calendar, I yes, you're right.\nSpeaker 1: But what we might well say, we've got these items remaining. We've got the housing element is seven B, the general plan is seven C and parking management is seven D. Who wants to make a motion councilmember? Not quite.\nSpeaker 3: Well. So I'm going to preface this with I would like us to consider putting we have a fifth to Tuesday between now and the seventh. This the seventh is going to be vision zero and a whole bunch other stuff.\nSpeaker 3: We there is no way we are getting through the work. So what I'd like to I will make a motion now for, for this part of the calendar, but I'm really hoping we can consider calling a special meeting on one of the two Tuesdays between now and the seventh or another day.\nSpeaker 3: To hear the rest of this agenda. I would like to move that. We hear item seven, which I think is probably one of the shorter items. I do not think we have time to even begin talking about the housing element or the general plan tonight at 1051 and any of the referrals that are remaining as long as\nSpeaker 3: we end before midnight and with the idea of moving the rest of the items to a special meeting.\nSpeaker 1: But we could hear regular items and go up to midnight. Is that what you're saying here?\nSpeaker 3: Seven D and then the and then the in any outs any referrals that that got we just got out of the way that we could that that that fit in the end there's only going to be 15 minutes or something by the time we get done with all this.\nSpeaker 3: I don't think we're moving too fast on this stuff.\nSpeaker 1: Well, I am. Okay. I'm not going to support moving to referrals tonight, but you have made your motion. Do we have a second? Was that you, Councilmember de SAC?\nSpeaker 4: A second was a quick comment. My quick comment is I agree that the housing element and general plan should be a special meeting. I think most cities do it that way. That's my second.\nSpeaker 1: I don't disagree. I think we're going to have a hard time around the Thanksgiving holiday because key staff incentives, council members may be out of town.\nSpeaker 2: Myself included.\nSpeaker 3: So we.\nSpeaker 1: Could try. Okay. However, we need to, we need to take a vote. Okay. So. So Councilmember Cox why made a motion council Desai his seconded it. Let's take a roll call vote. I'm sorry. We have a discussion cast over here, Spencer.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Just real quick, I will not be supporting this. I would rather just continue and at least start the draft housing element so that we could. We start towards that. Thanks.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Vice Mayor Vella.\nSpeaker 2: I'd be supportive of finding a way to add a meeting in between now and the next meeting for the housing element.\nSpeaker 1: But it couldn't be on a Tuesday because we wouldn't be able to have everyone we need. That's my.\nSpeaker 2: Point, but I'm happy to try to see if we can find a day. I'm not saying necessarily necessarily a Tuesday, but we will. We could ask for OC.\nSpeaker 1: We have a motion before us. Councilmember Knox. Right.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. We need four to have already said they are not going to support it. So I'm going to withdraw my motion and make the following motion that we were and we finished this item. We direct staff to find a time that works for the most council members possible between now and the seventh to hold a special meeting\nSpeaker 3: . And I want to be really clear in my language that I am saying that most council members like this is if somebody has to miss the meeting or whatever, then it has to. If has to be me, it has to be me.\nSpeaker 3: But we've got to get our work done and I feel like it's because.\nSpeaker 1: We only have a few minutes before this is all going to be moot.\nSpeaker 0: So may I say something? Sorry.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 0: Yes? I'm so sorry to interrupt, but you would need to identify that date and continue these items to that date, specifically tonight, because we don't have time to notice another meeting. So you would have to the date would have to be set as part of the vote.\nSpeaker 0: Sorry.\nSpeaker 3: Your muted Catherine's just a presence question we only need to make the decision before 11:00 to hear new items. Can we not get to figure out the date after 11:00? Yes. For a continuation.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, you can do that after 11:00. But I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure it was clean.\nSpeaker 3: It's good to make sure. Gives us a little bit more time and breathing in whenever it's up.\nSpeaker 1: To you and to contemplate the motioned Councilmember Harry Spencer was suggesting.\nSpeaker 3: I don't see a value in starting a conversation on the housing element and then stopping and then at some random time in the future, having public comment come in. I, I just that you're going to have different people there, etc..\nSpeaker 3: It's late. I don't. Should be a special meeting. We're going to have half a few people are going to comment.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. I'm going to limit the editorial comment just because we've got to get something that four people agree on or when it hits 11:00, we just finish this item. Is that correct, Madam Clerk?\nSpeaker 0: Right. To finish this item. And then you can do that. City Manager Communications. All communications.\nSpeaker 2: And telecommunications.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So in 4 minutes remaining, does anyone want to try to offer a motion? Vice Mayor of L.A. You're pretty good at that sort of thing. Or council rehearsed better. Perhaps the two of you. Quickly.\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to make a motion that we could just continue until midnight and start with this. The next item. Which is the housing element. It's a draft, and I think we need to start it. So people can we start thinking about our feedback and where the staff is?\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Anybody anywhere? Councilmember Vela Well, everyone, a second or a tweak or something. Quickly. Vice mayor, any thoughts?\nSpeaker 2: I would prefer that we just continue that item, the housing element item. I my preference isn't to start it.\nSpeaker 1: And would you continue it to that item six on the next semester?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Is that emotion so moved? Okay. Do we have a second counselor and not quite chime in? How can we make this better?\nSpeaker 3: I think that's going to be a multi-hour conversation with Vision Zero and everything else. We just put three other items before everything like.\nSpeaker 1: We got it.\nSpeaker 2: Can we? Okay. So can we, can we continue it to a special meeting or. We have to we have to take the date tonight. I have to pick the date.\nSpeaker 1: Or we can look we could agree to take one more item after this. And then after that we can discuss the date. Is that correct, Madam Clerk? But we've got to make a decision about what to.\nSpeaker 2: Do after the.\nSpeaker 0: 11:00 vote is just if you want to have a new item after 11. Correct.\nSpeaker 1: How about we take that parking item after about 70?\nSpeaker 2: How about we start with item seven? I'll make that motion. Okay. After this.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do we have a second?\nSpeaker 3: I'll second that.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let's have a roll call vote. Does everyone understand we're making a motion to continue this item and then take seven D and then we'll look at dates. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 0: Um, so I'm ready to proceed, sir.\nSpeaker 2: No.\nSpeaker 0: Not quite.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 2: I i.\nSpeaker 0: As the.\nSpeaker 1: Ashcraft I that.\nSpeaker 0: Carries by 4 to 1.\nSpeaker 2: Oh.\nSpeaker 1: With 2 minutes to spare. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Where were we? Who did I cut off? Was it. Is it you, Madam Vice Mayor? I think.\nSpeaker 2: I think the last motion failed. And so we were going to. Perhaps make an emotion. Well, no, we're we're.\nSpeaker 1: We're moving we're moving forward. We just passed that motion. We had four votes. We're going to hear more than 70. But you're talking about this item, the seven a?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. So my I was just making the point about the the the fact that we have over 200 unhoused individuals. That number has continued to grow in double digit percentages year over year. And we're in winter months. We know that there's weather events and everything else happening.\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, this is economy of scale, but at the same time, it's phasing it in. We're not we're not opening up all of these units. So I would like to move support of this with a direction to staff.\nSpeaker 2: And I know, Madam Mayor, you still have to give your comments.\nSpeaker 1: As I've just like. But yeah, you go ahead, make them.\nSpeaker 2: I'd at least like to get a motion on, on the table with, with, you know, with the comments around the contracting language being change, because I think that that needs to there needs to be some amendments there and then also that there be direction to have more than one community meeting, because I do think that that that\nSpeaker 2: will be needed.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Desai.\nSpeaker 4: I will second that motion and I will offer a comment. Shall I offer comment? I will wait for you, Madumere.\nSpeaker 1: You better wait for me.\nSpeaker 4: I will wait.\nSpeaker 1: If you want to stay on my good side. No, I appreciate everybody's comments and. And staff. And I appreciate Backes getting here in a hurry. Thank you. This is what I think. And I have had the privilege of visiting a site that backs Rand.\nSpeaker 1: And I've also talked with the mayors of Brooklyn, the mayor, the mayor, Brooklyn's one mayor, the mayors of Brooklyn and Oakland, about the incredible success they've had with backs at housing sites that that are run as co-housing in different neighborhoods where they've been able to buy up housing and and rehab it and it it's worked really well\nSpeaker 1: and the value of using an organization like Bax and congratulations Councilwoman Oxlade and your son working for them is they they have the track record. I didn't know how far back it went, but I know how extensive, especially in the housing crisis it has been.\nSpeaker 1: And and I just have to a really quick aside, when we visited the navigation center in Berkeley, which isn't this at all, it's like two dormitory style. One is for men, one is for women. There's, you know, bathrooms, communal bathrooms for men and women and a garden and all that.\nSpeaker 1: But talking to the residents there. There was a fellow we talked to who was a professor at Cal who had, you know, fallen on hard times, had an illness, ended up homeless, and yet this was, you know, getting him back on his feet.\nSpeaker 1: It's just there are so many ways that people become homeless. But I agree with everything that has been said about it would have been preferable to do the communication piece ahead of time. I also want to remind us that we stretch our minimal staff pretty thin.\nSpeaker 1: And so they this this I mean, there are only so many hours in a day to do these things. It's not a reason to delay this project because, as has been noted, we have a housing crisis. It's been a long time coming, you know, waiting to do something like this.\nSpeaker 1: And so I think that knowing that we're working with back at a trusted and experienced provider gives me a lot of confidence. However, what we also learned from doing these field trips in San Jose and Mountain View is it is critical to have good communication with the neighbors, to have a team, to have an advisory committee.\nSpeaker 1: The neighbors deserve to not only feel that they're being heard to be heard. And I fully expect them to be open minded and to allow themselves to be persuaded to learn more. But that road goes both ways. So communication is key.\nSpeaker 1: We're a little late starting, but we'll catch up. We'll get there. I'm confident that staff and personnel are capable of doing that. I did hear some neighbors talk about encampments in the area. I haven't this week been out to the area, but staff I do expect staff to be on top of that.\nSpeaker 1: I am really pleased that the day center is now open overnight. I just ran into Joey Harrison, who who runs a facility last night at an event. And he was so excited to tell me that two individuals who'd been previously sleeping out in public somewhere, they had eventually persuaded them to come.\nSpeaker 1: And they're sleeping overnight there and they come and go during the day. And it's made a huge difference. So please, let's go out and reach out to the folks in these encampments, get them connected with Village of Love.\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, maybe we can even get them into some of these programs because they you know, the neighbors raised this. And it's a concern. And we don't want people sleeping in encampments. We want them sleeping sheltered. And the other thing I just want to throw out, it's an idea that I learned about from the League of\nSpeaker 1: California Cities webinar on addressing homelessness or homelessness solutions. The City of Riverside has a expansive homelessness outreach program, and one of the things they've done is they've created a registry almost like if there is someone's getting married and they have a registry or, you know, something, having a baby.\nSpeaker 1: But what it is, the whoever they contract with has a wish list of the things they need to furnish these various units and they put them up there. It's it can go through Lowe's or whoever, you know, printed these sort of things.\nSpeaker 1: And community members can go on to the site and buy these furnishings and furnish these sites. It's just a way to promote community awareness and also a little buy in to a very, very valid program. The the only thing that I would add, other than what's been said about making sure that there's also a mechanism for dealing\nSpeaker 1: not only with businesses in the area, because really there's more residences in the area in any problems they might be having with the residents of these homes. But is also I do not support using funds, ARPA funds to buy a car for this program.\nSpeaker 1: When I asked the question of staff why a car? And they said, well, you know, some time back staff would drive it because sometimes people need to go to a doctor's appointment or to the DMV. That's fine, but we don't need to buy a car.\nSpeaker 1: We can contract with a local taxi company for taxi vouchers or something, but a car, the city using RPA funds to buy a car. And the insurance issues we don't usually are not in the business of transferring people.\nSpeaker 1: So I would respectfully ask that the purchase of a vehicle not be included if at some point it just becomes indispensable. But buying a car to go to occasional appointments doesn't seem like the best use of these dollars.\nSpeaker 1: I'd like them to go further. So anyway, I am. I'm really excited about moving this forward. I also have. Said to staff that to the extent that there are families available and families couch surfing, in my mind, maybe there's some legal reason they can't use it.\nSpeaker 1: But these are homes with yards of backyards and places for kids to run around and there could definitely be a co-housing model. I think that's possible. So just keep that in mind just because I think it's a lovely opportunity.\nSpeaker 1: So I am ready to go full speed ahead on this. Councilmember Dysart, back to you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. You know, if I can just speak to the residents who live in the surrounding areas, I certainly hear the concerns that you have raised. And so I think to the extent possible, try to scrutinize the contract that we we have before us.\nSpeaker 4: And I do believe that I found some shortcomings in there. And I think I have to trust our staff, both our city manager and his staff and our city attorney and and his staff, that they've listened to the concerns that not just me, but everyone else on council has raised, and that we will strengthen the contract that's\nSpeaker 4: before us. I do think that this is a rare opportunity to quickly address the homeless crisis that we're having, not just in the in our area, but in our city itself. And so, again, with the arc of funds that we have available, we can do something that we had never we had not been able to do before\nSpeaker 4: . But I think you're right, though. I think the the contract has to be strengthened, because I think there are some areas in there that seem to be obvious in terms of like making sure that we contractually include the concerns of residents along the lines that we had discussed earlier.\nSpeaker 4: So that's why I'm going to support this. And, you know, I think in the end, Alameda point, especially the big white area, I think as a city, we'll all be better for it to have a mixed community that that we're we've been contemplating for Alameda point not just the big whites area but also around city and other\nSpeaker 4: places.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilmember Desai. Councilmember Harris Spencer.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. So I will not be supporting this. I think that it's truly unfortunate that we're not doing the public outreach in advance prior to this. I also do think that the community has been asked to. I think it really is already a mixed use community.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that we I think that they raised legitimate concerns, but I think that they absolutely needed to be involved in the conversation before this came to us. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And Madam Vice Mayor, just want to restate that motion, please.\nSpeaker 2: I had moved too to move forward with with this with the comments relative to addressing the contract as proposed from the council and then also requiring that there be more than more community engagement meetings so that there can be responsiveness to the community concerns raised.\nSpeaker 2: Madam Chair, I don't think your your request to remove the funding for the car. That's fine with me. I don't know if I need to amend the motion, but I don't have a problem with that.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I would appreciate if you would. Okay. And so Viceroy Villa made the motion she submitted in council every day. So you certainly didn't. You? Okay. Thank you. Okay. May we have a roll call vote, please.\nSpeaker 2: And so every day shock.\nSpeaker 0: Over Spencer. No knocks like.\nSpeaker 3: High.\nSpeaker 2: Rella high.\nSpeaker 0: As the Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 1: High that.\nSpeaker 0: Carries 4 to 1.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you all. Thank you, staff for putting this together. Thank you, Mr. Russell. Thank you to the neighbors for all your insightful comments. We heard you, and we will heed you. And we will be looking forward to hearing from you more and incorporating your thoughts and comments.\nSpeaker 1: So this is an important first step, big step forward. Yet another one tonight. So. Okay, everyone go forth and do good work. Thank you so much. All right. We are going to quickly change.\nSpeaker 2: Gears.\nSpeaker 1: And move to item seven D. Madam Clerk, while we're changing the scenery, could you please introduce this item for us?\nSpeaker 0: A recommendation to reorganize the city's parking management program and parking fund and adoption of related resolutions.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Religious freedoms and social and economic justice.\nSpeaker 4: Ready.\nSpeaker 0: And Brody.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Madam Mayor. I do want to first say that, you know, I recognize that bringing a referral on such an important topic during the meeting of the swearing in of our new council members and our treasurer and our auditor, which is typically ceremonial, is unusual.\nSpeaker 6: And I appreciate, you know, staff's indulgence and letting me do this. But, you know, we live in extraordinary times right now. So I think that, you know, having this referral and hearing it today requires some extraordinary action. And I do want to say at the onset that, you know, the reason for bringing in this has nothing to\nSpeaker 6: do with our police department. You know, I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for our officers. And, you know, I know from my first hand that they also have that respect for our community. Just in the past couple of weeks, you know, for the second time in a row, I went with the police officers to\nSpeaker 6: shop with the cop at Target, you know, where they helped underprivileged children, you know, go on a shopping spree so they could buy their presence, you know, for something that they wouldn't already have. And in fact, a lot of them bought things for their mother and their brother and, you know, supplies that they needed.\nSpeaker 6: And, you know, just to see the heart of our police officers. And again, last weekend, I was able to go with Santa, of all people and our police officers and deliver more presents. So, you know, I want to make sure that people understand that this is no way, you know, directed towards anything bad about our police officers\nSpeaker 6: . And I appreciate, you know, all of your hard work. But the reason I did this, you know, a couple of things. You know, we say that everybody belongs here. And I think it's time that rather than just saying it and putting up a poster, you know, that we actually demonstrate to members our community that actually everyone belongs\nSpeaker 6: here. Now, I'm you know, I like to say what I say, but if somebody else says it better than I like to quote them, and I did receive, in fact, just this morning, an email from one of our constituents.\nSpeaker 6: And he basically said the majority of the voters in the country voted against Trump. And I think in Alameda, it was over 80% voted against him. There's no mandate for breaking up families, terrorizing children and deporting valued members of our community.\nSpeaker 6: You know, and that's one of the things that, you know, I think it's time for us to take a stand. You know, I don't share my personal story with many people that my great great grandfather, Odie, with my namesake, you know, he came to this country and he was in the Queen's Navy, Queen Victoria, back in the\nSpeaker 6: 1870s, and he jumped ship in Halifax, Canada. And he ran the story, as I was told. He ran as far as he could, and he settled in Nebraska. And his his because his issue is not whether the Americans would go after him for being in our country.\nSpeaker 6: You know, his issue was whether the British would come after him and whether he would face, you know, persecution or prosecution in his country. And that's, you know, similar to, you know, what we see today. We see immigrants from El Salvador and Honduras and Nicaragua and, you know, some of the drug ridden cities in Mexico, you know\nSpeaker 6: , escaping their home countries. And they shouldn't be worried. I mean, they are worried about their home countries and people coming after them from their home countries. And we shouldn't have them worry about people coming after them from from this country.\nSpeaker 6: And, you know, it kind of hit me most direct. And I see Rabbi Brickner here in the front row. And he and I were having a discussion about another topic back in that room there. And he asked me, you know, why are you doing this?\nSpeaker 6: And I looked at him and I looked out at the police headquarters and I said, if I'm sitting here in this room on January 20th and I'm seeing our Muslim citizens lined up at City Hall registering and I'm driving through town and seeing our families broken up and officers, you know, arresting people and rounding up people and\nSpeaker 6: writing people. And I knew that I could do something about it. I knew that we as a city could do something about it. And I can never live with myself. So this is why I'm bringing in this referral.\nSpeaker 6: I think it's it's important we can't sit by and do nothing. And I hope that our council can can be supportive. I just want to quickly go through some of the highlights, you know. Asking for an analysis of the potential and realistic financial impacts, you know, of actually having a sanctuary city, you know, type policy with our\nSpeaker 6: police department. You know, that includes things such as general prohibitions on assistance or joint patrols with ICE, you know, don't ask policies, you know, prohibition on, you know, accessing the NCIC National Crime Information Center database for immigration arrests, you know, prohibition on joint operations with ICE.\nSpeaker 6: And one thing I think we do have, you know, the no holds or no notifications, you know, of release states. I know we do have a policy, but I think it can be strengthened. And not only can it be strengthened, it can be transformed from a policy into a resolution which reaffirms that our community stands behind all\nSpeaker 6: of our residents, you know, no matter you know, who they are and where they're from. You know, and the second thing is that if you know, there is a request and it could happen, I mean, I have to trust that our new president is going to keep his promises.\nSpeaker 6: If there is a movement to start arresting and doing mass deportations that our our fine police department do not participate. You know, number three, you know that we refuse to honor any request by the federal government to register anyone based on their religious affiliation.\nSpeaker 6: And I think that's just, you know, really critical. And then lastly, and I know that a lot of this is going on with the shrub, but I think it's important that our community weigh in and we do a statement of our values similar to what San Francisco did and say, you know, these are the people we care\nSpeaker 6: about and we care about everyone. And everyone does belong here. And, you know, I'm happy to have that as part of the shrub. I'm happy to do that as council. But I think our council needs to weigh in and say we're putting a stake in the ground we are going to stand for and protect our most vulnerable\nSpeaker 6: people.\nSpeaker 0: So we have 16 public speakers. At this point, if you'd like to speak on this item, please submit your slip and it'll be 3 minutes for each speaker so you can line up that side of the wall. I'll call like five names at a time.\nSpeaker 0: Brian Kennedy. Dora Calhoun. Philip James. Dan Westerling. David GREENE. Those are.\nSpeaker 3: First speakers.\nSpeaker 0: Brian Kennedy.\nSpeaker 4: Hi there. I'm Brian Kennedy. I've been a member of the Alameda community for 17 years, and I'm here to voice my opposition to making Alameda a sanctuary city for illegal aliens. I'd like to share a photograph with all of you council in the audience as well.\nSpeaker 4: If you could please take a look at that. Especially you, Jim.\nSpeaker 6: People are not illegal.\nSpeaker 4: This is a picture of a young American girl named Kate Stanley. Kate Stanley was murdered by an illegal alien released under San Francisco sanctuary city policy because of this policy which you're trying to bring here is costing American lives.\nSpeaker 4: And she's not the only one. Three members of the Polonia family were also murdered by another illegal alien, also released under a sanctuary city policy. This policy is putting people in danger. It's illegal because you're rewarding lawbreakers. And you're actually spitting on all the people who are lawfully trying to enter this country.\nSpeaker 4: And illegal aliens are cut in front of a red light. I think it's a bad idea. And if you don't take my word for it, talk to the Stoneleigh family. Talk talk to the Polonia family.\nSpeaker 0: Hold your comments from the audience. It's very important that we allow everyone to be able to speak. Thank you. Please continue.\nSpeaker 4: So I think they would back me up and Jim, I think they'd be totally against what you're doing. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Doris Calhoun. Audience. You must be quiet at this point. Otherwise you'll be asked to leave. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Or I'm going to.\nSpeaker 2: Tell you a little bit about myself. So maybe you could you pull.\nSpeaker 0: The bike down so we can hear you.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself, so maybe you can better understand my position on this.\nSpeaker 3: This subject, this subject. I am a naturalized citizen, born in Central.\nSpeaker 2: America and passionately opposed to illegal.\nSpeaker 3: Immigration, except under very special circumstances.\nSpeaker 2: Where government is persecuting persecuting groups for religious or political.\nSpeaker 3: Reasons. Sanctuary cities are a slap on the.\nSpeaker 2: Face of those people waiting in line to follow the laws of the country where they wish to immigrate. I know it is a long and arduous process. My mother thought the process worthwhile, regardless of the many sacrifices she had to make.\nSpeaker 2: She came here as a nanny for a specified number of years in exchange for a permanent green card which allowed her to be here legally. From there, she worked and saved enough to bring my sister and I here separately one at a time.\nSpeaker 2: Under the law, she had to prove that she was working.\nSpeaker 3: Had enough money saved, so that neither she nor the person she was.\nSpeaker 2: Bringing would be a burden on the government. She worked two jobs and went to school at night to obtain a skill which would allow her to have a better job. She finally attained her dream of becoming a hairstylist and was able to leave her job packing chickens at American poultry.\nSpeaker 2: I was just under five years old when she first left, and I was without her in the care of my grandmother until almost 11 years old when she was finally able to bring me here legally. All of us go through and all of us had to go through an extensive background check and a medical exam to make\nSpeaker 2: sure we were not inadvertently bringing in any communicable diseases. My mom instilled in me a love for this country while still keeping a pride in my heritage. I am an American of Spanish heritage, but an American first. When I became a citizen, I vowed.\nSpeaker 3: Allegiance to the United States and renounce allegiance.\nSpeaker 2: To all other foreign countries. Every country has a right to choose who can and cannot be admitted. And if you are in Guatemala, Mexico or other Latin American countries illegally.\nSpeaker 3: They don't shield you from being.\nSpeaker 2: Deported or from going to jail for violating their laws. That is the right and should be ours as well. We are a country of laws. That is what I was taught in school and what our constitution guarantees this.\nSpeaker 2: Immigration laws are federal laws, not state, not city laws. I say governing body. I implore you to follow the law and unite. Declare Alameda an illegal sanctuary city. City. As Councilmember Ashcroft outlined earlier, Alameda has enough issues to keep us busy.\nSpeaker 2: We do not need to take on an issue that is not in our best interest as a community.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for watching.\nSpeaker 4: Hello, City Council. I am very fortunate to have been able to grow up in Alameda and to live here now. I did not go to college in Alameda and when I went to college in another city in Central California, I remember looking up one day and recognizing that the city that I was in felt less diverse and\nSpeaker 4: less integrated than the city of Alameda. I think there is a long tradition of Alameda being a place that is both accepted and more integrated than segregated. I look at other cities in the Bay Area where I work, where I have friends that work, and they can claim to be diverse, but many of them cannot claim to\nSpeaker 4: be as integrated as Alameda is. A lot of the previous speakers have talked about individuals, individuals coming from different countries, individuals who are affected by immigration. But I think we also need to think about the individuals that we know in Alameda that would be affected by not implementing a policy like this.\nSpeaker 4: Individuals who are trying to make a better life here could be deported. Individuals who could be treated unfairly under laws that may come down from the federal government. We have a chance to be a leader in the Bay Area, and I think we should take that chance.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Dan Westmoreland.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening.\nSpeaker 4: I'm Dan Westerlund. I've lived in Alameda for 29 years. I own a house here. My daughter attended Alameda High School. My wife and I live here. Work here. Shop here. Out here. This is our home. I'd like to thank the City Council for allowing me to come speak tonight, and I would like to commend the proponents of\nSpeaker 4: this measure for their compassion and their fervor. However. They are wrong. And this proposal is wrongheaded. Making Alameda a sanctuary city is the wrong policy put forward at the wrong time and in the wrong way. This issue has been discussed for decades.\nSpeaker 4: In Alameda has never considers itself an a sanctuary city. Now, suddenly, after one hastily scheduled and little publicized subcommittee meeting and tonight's city council. Some residents are calling for swift and immediate action. This is not. How democracy works.\nSpeaker 4: Some would have us believe that unless this policy is immediately adopted, there will be mass arrests, internment camps and other various innuendoes and cliches, all of it unfounded fear mongering at its worst. Rather, the people this policy will most directly benefit in immediately are hardened, violent criminals.\nSpeaker 4: Men like Francisco Sanchez, a five time convicted and deported felon who was released from custody despite. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer. A young woman's life ended too soon in a family destroyed because of a sanctuary city policy, the very same policy that some are advocating we adopt.\nSpeaker 4: Where is the compassion for Kate Steinle? For her mother and her father for the entire Stanely family. Where is the compassion for her unborn children and the joy they would have brought? Compassion. Isn't that the central element of this argument?\nSpeaker 4: And I ask you, where is your compassion for the future? Kate Stanley's of Alameda when this position when this policy will facilitate the release of criminals back into our community. Each year, tens of thousands of illegal aliens are released by sanctuary cities despite federal detainers for deportation, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\nSpeaker 4: These include the worst of the worst, and the majority of them are labeled by the Department of Homeland Security as a public safety concern. If Alameda becomes a sanctuary city, these are the types of criminals that will be released back into our island city.\nSpeaker 4: And when they commit additional crimes and they will commit additional crimes. Each of you and each of us. Will be culpable. This would be a policy with immense financial, legal, environmental and moral ramifications for each and every one of the 80,000 residents and voters of Alameda.\nSpeaker 4: Let me repeat that. Financial, legal, environmental and moral. None of which the city nor any of the proponents can adequately address at this time. And yet this is being rushed forward with minimal discussion and little public review.\nSpeaker 0: If you could finish up your comments.\nSpeaker 4: If the proponents of this policy wish to move forward, let them do it the right way. Start petitions, obtain signatures, convince their fellow citizens, and then put the proposed policy on the ballot. Let each voter in Alameda have a voice.\nSpeaker 4: Put the matter before our meetings and let us decide. If the council chooses to act either for or against, they will have denied voters that opportunity and stolen their voice. Let the people decide.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, David GREENE.\nSpeaker 4: You can. So as the elected leaders of this city, you're expected to have a sense of wisdom and under standing and make decisions based on reason and fact. Putting out images of a line on January 20th of people lining up is not fact.\nSpeaker 4: That's not the way it's going to go down and you know it. We're looking for you to have wisdom that's beyond some detrimental diversions to the city. Let's make sure that we are considering some big, big time realities here.\nSpeaker 4: One, let's make sure that we're thinking about nationally. Police officers are being asked to follow more and more rules. And at the same time, oh, yeah, they're being ambushed. And in this environment, our city council wants to explore placing a possible wedge between cooperating city, state, federal resources to help maintain the citizens and police officer safety.\nSpeaker 4: The safety that we pay for that I pay for. You are now thinking of as a citizen. I cannot have that benefit for something that I pay for. Is that your job? No, it's not your job to make that kind of a decision.\nSpeaker 4: And also now we're thinking of something akin to trying to keep up with the Joneses across the street. There's a city across the bay that produced a model of a a proclamation that we want to follow. If I wanted that I would live in that city and I would have voted for those people.\nSpeaker 4: We already have. Everybody belongs here. What? You want to yell louder? The bottom line is this is that let's not forget that those people who put out this proclamation in their city are the same people that put rules around a sanctuary that can that contributed to the death of a beautiful daughter walking with her father.\nSpeaker 4: And now you want this same foundation to exist here in Alameda. You want that to be a legacy of yours. This is ridiculous. Mayor and members of the Council. Please focus on local issues and do your job. Let's talk about Alameda point, the firefighters pension.\nSpeaker 4: Let's talk about school facilities attracting investment training for our police. Let's talk about things that we can affect. You're here in alameda. Alameda, r.f.d. by the water mayberry. If you want something bigger, it's not here. If you want something bigger, don't force it down my throat.\nSpeaker 4: If you want something bigger, possibly. Think of resigning and running for another office. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next feature, I'm going to call the next five names Barnett Brickner, Angela Hawk about Sarah O.D. Scott Cert Chick. It looks like and booms icon.\nSpeaker 2: The Rabbi.\nSpeaker 4: Well again, good evening and thank you, council members for giving us this time and attention. Coincidentally, I am not a 20 year member of Al Qaeda. I'm actually a four or five year member of parliament. And I came here precisely because of its open policies and not because it's Mayberry RFD.\nSpeaker 4: But rather because it's an inclusive community with all of its diversity. I came here because I believed that this community represents and I have not yet been proven wrong. That when one opens one's hands. One is able to receive a lot more and benefit and grow more.\nSpeaker 4: Then when one closes one's hands. When one's opens one's borders and allows all of the brilliance of diversity in. We can grow a whole lot better. Then when we close our borders and try to wall ourselves in and ignore the outside world.\nSpeaker 4: And with that, I want to suggest that in this climate, it's important that this city makes that message clear to anyone here and on who and those who are not on the island. That they're welcome. And that they're safe and they do not need to worry.\nSpeaker 4: It's the fear mongering of those who oppose this proposal that worries me. It's the fear mongering that immediately everyone that isn't an illegal is an illegal alien is somehow a crime criminal is just false. It's not true. Yes.\nSpeaker 4: We're not perfect. But we are better than this. And so please, I ask you to consider this proposal and vote affirmatively. And I applaud you, Jim. I applaud you. For your conviction and your principle and for leading this community in this time.\nSpeaker 4: In this season of light and of hope. By the way, I want to wish you all a happy Hanukkah. Okay. Open up your hands so that we all can thrive. Angela.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, members of the city council. I'm Angela hawk about and i am from the Alameda Renters Coalition and we see a very practical purpose to having a sanctuary city policy in Alameda. We want to see as many renters as possible applying to the Rent Review Advisory Committee.\nSpeaker 3: We want to get as much information as possible so that we can make changes to 3148 and we see one major barrier. And that's that there are some people who might be undocumented, who might be in process or who might have criminal backgrounds, who find it difficult to approach the rent review advisory committee.\nSpeaker 3: They're afraid that they're going to be some of these things are going to come out of the closet and it will make their housing situation even more difficult when they apply elsewhere. So I'm very thrilled that Councilmember Ody has put this forward so quickly, because we need this as soon as possible to get as many people coming\nSpeaker 3: to the right review advisory committee as possible. And I wish to also ask that language be added to 3148 that specifically forbids the question about whether someone is documented and what their criminal history might be unless there is actually a crime in the proceedings.\nSpeaker 3: So I thank you very much for listening and have a happy holiday.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Sarah. And.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Madam Mayor, and members of the City Council. Firstly, I would like to say I am here speaking in favor of this referral because the personal is political. I'm the daughter of an immigrant and the xenophobia of all immigrants, whether undocumented or not, brought into light during this election cycle, has been concerning.\nSpeaker 3: My sister called me on election night in tears, asking me what's going to happen to our mother? Hopefully nothing happens to her mother. And even if this wasn't my background, I would still be here in favor of this referral because it is the right thing to do.\nSpeaker 3: The city has adopted the School Board's Everyone Belongs Here campaign and we should uphold that tonight and move forward with protecting all of our citizens against fear and hatred. And I hope we never have to use this policy because I hope it never comes to mass arrests and tournaments and registrations.\nSpeaker 3: But if it does, we need to have something in place that affirms our values and fights back against hate. And many of our friends and neighbors are afraid for their safety with the incoming administration and the promises that the president elect has made.\nSpeaker 3: Alameda needs to show them that we not only support and value them, but we respect their humanity. And I'll end with quoting Martin Luther King Jr. An injustice everywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. You vote yes.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, council members. Thank you for having me and listening to my. But I have to say this evening and also to my fellow Alameda residents. I went to elementary school as a boy here. I came here when I was 15.\nSpeaker 4: 1980, I'm sorry. In 1979. I was a latchkey kid. And I struggled to survive back then. And I struggle to survive today. At the age of 17, I joined the U.S. Army and went to Europe. I served my country for 17 years before the Reagan administration said, oh, well, you know, we want to cut back our forces\nSpeaker 4: . Most of my time was self served in Europe and as. A soldier in Europe at 17 and for being gone for 17 years. When I was finally released after the first Gulf War of being retained on a stop loss program, I was finally then able to return to my beautiful Alameda, my sanctuary city, only to find that\nSpeaker 4: I couldn't get a job. There were no doors open for me. I was a high school graduate from Alameda. But because I didn't have a job and I didn't have I couldn't get an address. I couldn't get an address because I couldn't get a job.\nSpeaker 4: So where is where is the sanctuary for people like me today? For the third time, I'm back in Alameda. Living in Alameda, I rent. So I have to close my house because I can't afford to be living in Alameda and paying rent.\nSpeaker 4: I can't afford a house, not even with a VA loan. Because I can't earn a living here. Because your policies undermine my ability to do business. Your policies open the doors up for undocumented workers and illegal workers. When I first came back to Alameda and I tried to go get a job at the marina, I was told\nSpeaker 4: by the marina owners, Oh, well, you know, I only hire the undocumented workers that come here seasonally because they cost so much less. And I don't have to pay for this and this and that. And today I run a business.\nSpeaker 4: All hands on deck, working on boats in the marina. I can't hardly. Well, I have to decide if I'm going to continue to do business in Alameda or not. The reason for that is because I can't compete with the undocumented workers that can come and work for $13 an hour or less.\nSpeaker 4: And don't pay taxes. They don't have they don't pay the insurance. They don't pay the city licenses. They don't pay any of the things that I. For some reason, I'm forced to pay. Why do I have to pay it?\nSpeaker 4: And they don't. When you talk about equal rights and everyone's here and everyone's welcome. Well, what about me? What about the altimeters? Take. Take the our meters first. We have enough children here. Your own children are scared to death because they don't have a future in their own city.\nSpeaker 4: They can't afford to live here. They can't find jobs here because the jobs are being taken by all the illegal and un and undocumented workers and and the people and the people who support that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: I have a comment. I'm sorry. When we when we first started this evening, we took a pledge of allegiance to the American flag. And we have a California Republic flag right there. And your policies, which are projecting and what you're describing this evening are sedition est.\nSpeaker 0: All right.\nSpeaker 4: So you're very much you're you're also promoting your future.\nSpeaker 0: But you can do this. You can have someone else fill out a slip, and then they can see their time to you if you want to go beyond the 3 minutes. Thank you. I appreciate your comments. You can.\nSpeaker 4: Good afternoon. Evening. My name is Hamzah Khan. I've been living in Alameda since November 2013. I'm for the sanctuary city for the simple reason not only in America, specifically California, specifically the Bay Area and and the East Bay.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, immigrants are very much the foundation for a lot of the tech companies that are really influencing not only California, but the whole world. Everything from Pixar to the Silicon Valley to Apple to Google. If you're not for the sanctuary city for moral reasons, you should be for simple commercial ones.\nSpeaker 4: And to go around attacking immigrants is just bad business. And to the man who came before me, my heart breaks for him. It does. But attacking immigrants is not going to give you your job back or anyone's job back.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, it's pretty much this is this is the code foundation from which our country is based. And if anyone thinks that this isn't a direct attack on immigrants in general or just illegal immigrants, I mean. Did you watch the election like so?\nSpeaker 4: Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All right. Our next speakers will be Sheriff Joe Hanson, Lillian Gow, Edo. Next speaker. So hive s a h r a y e. Next would be Justin, the Don Yo's, Adonis, and then Christian. Well, that looks like.\nSpeaker 0: All right, Cherry.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mary Spencer in council.\nSpeaker 0: I am Sherry Johansen and I represent the Alameda.\nSpeaker 3: Progressives and we are speaking in favor of a resolution for a sanctuary city. I have not been in Alameda for 20 years. I've been here actually less than two. And I came from a sanctuary city, Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nSpeaker 3: And one of the reasons that I chose to move to.\nSpeaker 0: Alameda is because of.\nSpeaker 3: Its diversity and its inclusiveness. I think as in.\nSpeaker 0: In Santa Fe.\nSpeaker 3: That diversity improves the culture and the whole atmosphere of a community. The diverse culture, the diverse art, the language brings so much richness to a community. So I commend. Counselor. For bringing this to your attention. And we strongly recommend that you support this resolution.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: It's so HIV. So I've. So HIV last name is a h r a y. E. Last call. Esso AIB is the first name S.A. HRA. Why is the last name? All right. I'm going to go ahead and call the next speaker.\nSpeaker 0: Justin Madonna's.\nSpeaker 4: Assalamu alaikum. I come to you as a Filipino and a son of immigrants? Long time ago. We were a colony. Til America. Long time ago. We fought your wars for you. And we still do not get these rights.\nSpeaker 4: Long time ago when Native Americans were. Here. We took part of their language. When I say Na, Na and Part II, they are of Native American. Language. Immigrants. We get the job done as the Hamilton quote from that Broadway musical, If You Love It.\nSpeaker 4: What heart has me shaken up is. I worked as a cement mason. I hear that Alameda will house job corpse. I used to go to Job Corp's and I met so many undocumented youth who needed jobs, who needed help with their Spanish.\nSpeaker 4: With their English. With just. Their lives. And we are helping American lives if we help with this sanctuary city because culture. But we need to push it for the knowledge. For understanding for the pluralism which America foundation of liberty and justice.\nSpeaker 4: Reside on. I implore you to have. This pluralism, because when when the Spanish brought Native American slaves to the Philippines. They were immigrants to us and our languages. Our multitude of languages resides with the Native American, with the Asian Asiatic, with the Austronesian languages, with our ancestors are even Muslims, the Hindus.\nSpeaker 4: And we wish that we to see this pluralism, this creativity, this culture culminate. My last name is voidness. It means knowledge. It is from the Vedas. It is like Dravid. Truth seeker. That is what I seek. I seek truth.\nSpeaker 4: And. If you help with this plan. I will work hard like John F Kennedy said. Do what? Don't ask what your country can do for you. Do what you can do for your country. And I'm just paraphrasing, but that's all.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Lillian.\nSpeaker 8: And then Kristen.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. Congratulations, Melia. My name is Lilian Gallardo. I'm with Filipino Advocates for Justice. We operate a youth development program at an Arsenal high school where we've done that work for over ten years. We also have a youth development program in Union City.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm here to speak in support of Alameda strengthening its commitment to immigrants through a sanctuary resolution, and in particular, for doing it proactively. I know there are people who say we should wait and see what happens in the Trump administration.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that it's much more important for us to be a model for what we think the for how we think that the immigrant population, the undocumented population in particular, the migrant population, should be treated in this in this city because it is it does recognize the important role that immigrants have historically and continue to this\nSpeaker 2: day and probably in the future play in the economy of this country. We are part of a network of immigrant rights organizations that have been meeting since Election Day to set up a rapid response network. We I think it's particularly important for cities who are outside of the urban core to be part of that rapid response network\nSpeaker 2: . I think that those cities are more vulnerable in terms of of possible raids. We experienced a raid in Union City last spring and, you know, there was very little infrastructure there to do know your rights for the community and the Dakota part of Union City.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that there's still a lot to be done in Alameda County to reach all the other cities that may be vulnerable after Election Day. Teachers and students at Logan High School, teachers and students at internal high school were questioning what might happen in in and fearful about what might happen in the ensuing months.\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, we were hard pressed to find lawyers who would come out and know your rights education. And I think by having a position on sanctuary, that we begin to set up that kind of process and infrastructure for this and other communities outside of the urban cores where there is a strong immigrant rights movement.\nSpeaker 2: I also want to congratulate and be and say that I'm proud of California state legislature. Right after Election Day, they came out with a statement in support of the immigrant population and their intention to not cooperate with ICE.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that was a perfect example. The Bay Area is home to organizations that have a lot of information about the history of Sanctuary, how sanctuary could work. And I'm going to leave with your clerk information that I can also email to you when I get your email addresses.\nSpeaker 2: But this is information from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a copy of the the state of California's Bill SB 54, and a statement from the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, all of which I think provide wonderful examples for why we should do sanctuary in Alameda.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Kristen.\nSpeaker 0: We have like seven more speakers on this item. If you want to speak on this item, please submit the speaker slip.\nSpeaker 3: I council members. I actually wasn't even.\nSpeaker 0: If you could speak into them, I reckon. Racist.\nSpeaker 3: I wasn't even going to speak tonight, but I came here for a swearing in. Congratulations again. But I heard that this was on the agenda and it's something that I feel very passionately about. So I figured I'd stick around and give you my $0.02.\nSpeaker 3: I'm strongly in favor of making Alameda a sanctuary city. Recently, as you know, there have been some hate crimes at public schools here in Alameda here in our island town. It's pretty hard to believe when you think about the kindness of our fellow neighbors and our city residents that that could happen here.\nSpeaker 3: A child at a middle school here in Alameda was threatened with deportation and told now that Trump one, they're coming for. You know, if you heard that children in my daughter's classes are afraid that they won't be able to stay in this country and that their families will be torn apart.\nSpeaker 3: My friend who's a journalist, she actually doesn't live in Alameda, but she is Muslim and she gets hate emails on a regular basis and death threats. One of the things that I love about Alameda is its diversity. I grew up in San Francisco and I recognize the cultural, religious and nonreligious LGBTQ differently abled.\nSpeaker 3: All individuals, children and families should feel safe and welcome here. They should not have to live in fear. I'd like to thank Jim, Audie for his very passionate, powerful words and commitment to keep our city residents safe. I applaud the Council for considering this amendment, and I hope it's passed.\nSpeaker 3: Let Alameda help lead the way. Thank you. Thank you. All right.\nSpeaker 0: Our next speakers will be Reverend Yoshi, Danielle Miller, R, Allison Green, Deborah Arbuckle, and then Austin Tam. Reverend Yoshi.\nSpeaker 4: Here's Spencer in council members. My name is Michael Yoshioka, pastor of the Buena Vista United Methodist Church. I'm a relative newcomer to Alameda. I was appointed in Alameda in 1988, so I've been here almost 30 years. This is, I think, a short time for some of us.\nSpeaker 4: But the church I serve has been around since 1898 and originally serving the immigrant Japanese community and historically served the Japanese-American community over these many years. So on behalf of the ancestors of our church who worked in this community to build it up, I welcome newcomers here to this place on this evening, and I want to speak\nSpeaker 4: in support of Councilmember Otis resolution. I see it as a comprehensive resolution, not just about sanctuary city, but what he said about mass arrests and the tournaments, registrations of individuals based on religion and also ensuring a racial and social diverse community with economic justice.\nSpeaker 4: We're particularly concerned about this. Now, many of you heard a spokesperson for the president elect talk about the precedent for mass registration of Muslims would be the Japanese-American internment that happened here in Alameda. My friends, two members of the congregation that I serve, 1942 Executive Order 1966, ordered all Japanese-Americans into camps across the country.\nSpeaker 4: There were ten camps in which people were put in in mass incarceration. What he didn't mention was that there was a Civil Liberties Act in 1988, which many of us worked on, to get an apology for the from the government, for the abridgment of our civil liberties.\nSpeaker 4: And that act in 1988 was passed by by Congress apologizing to Japanese-Americans and citing the fact that there were three factors involved in what happened there. One was this war hysteria that was taking place, and two, was the preexisting racial prejudice against Japanese-Americans.\nSpeaker 4: And thirdly, the lack of political leadership. At that time, no one in Alameda spoke up for the Japanese community here, either for the Methodist church or for the Buddhist community. And so people were carted off. Church services were.\nSpeaker 4: Dismissed. And people's belongings were all stored in the social hall of our church. People were able to come back, though, and establish roots back in this community. I applaud member Odie for his political leadership in this time of great uncertainty that is in front of us.\nSpeaker 4: And I hope and pray that all of you will follow his lead in this resolution so that we can move forward proactively and protect vulnerable communities. We are also, as a church, supporting immigrant migrant ministries, particularly with Central American refugees, with the East Bay Immigrant Coalition, with scores of other congregations.\nSpeaker 4: And I share with you, these are not criminals. These are people who are trying to make a living, make a life. They would love to be back in their homes as well. But we have to look at our relationships internationally as well.\nSpeaker 4: And what are the push and pulls of why people are coming here and what is our implication in the policies that we make that drive people out as well? Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Danielle marie. Danielle.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Mayor Spencer and council members. My name is Danielle Miller. I've been a resident of Alameda for nine years and one of the things that I love most about living in Alameda is the strong community that that we have here, the strong, diverse community that I've had the opportunity to be a part of.\nSpeaker 3: But I'm afraid that there's a lot of people that live in Alameda that are not sure whether they are really part of that community or not. I'm afraid that there's a lot of people who are concerned that if they come forward, if they report things to the police, if they make requests to the housing authority or they\nSpeaker 3: make other requests of city government, that there may be implications for that for their immigration status. I think that the city has an opportunity right now to proactively and unequivocally declare that everyone belongs here, that we can make policies, not just have posters and nice words, but policies that really enforce our our belief that this is an\nSpeaker 3: inclusive place to live and that we will proactively protect the people that live here, that we will not participate in federal actions to to to deport people, and that we will not ask for a people's immigration status. I think that it's also important that this policy is inclusive enough to declare our commitment and support for LGBTQ rights\nSpeaker 3: , for women's rights, for religious freedom, and for social, economic and racial justice. So thank you for your proactive action on this really important issue. Allison Aubrey.\nSpeaker 2: I also came here swearing in and celebration and.\nSpeaker 0: Stayed for this point.\nSpeaker 2: I'm not often at a loss for words. When I was a little girl in Canton, Ohio, in a very small Jewish community. Many of my religious school teachers had tattoos on their arms from Auschwitz. And other horrible places.\nSpeaker 2: And they they didn't end up in those concentration camps. The lucky ones who survived and were able to emigrate out because somebody woke up one day and thought it was a great idea to do this. It was years and years in Germany of sowing dissent and making people and others and telling people who lived in towns, well\nSpeaker 2: , you know, someone's coming to take what's yours. And these people are your enemy. I'm a man who I work with and greatly respect its Japanese heritage. His parents, both doctorates. University teachers in California spent the war World War Two time in internment camps.\nSpeaker 2: But let's not talk about history and let's make this local. When I walked, I don't even know why I was in the police station earlier this year and I saw that everyone belongs here. Color shield there. And I actually got tears in my eyes because I couldn't imagine, you know, as a as an adult lesbian, now middle\nSpeaker 2: aged, being a young kid, seeing that in my high school, in my police station, and I felt it. I can't tell you how I felt. And then couple of months later, during the RNC, someone took our stars and stripes wearing the flag off the front of our house and tried to set it on fire.\nSpeaker 2: And it was found in Lincoln Park, and that was before the election. A young man who was born and raised in Alameda, has extended family here, been here for generations of Mexican heritage, was doing some work for us a couple of weeks ago and said, you know, yeah, I had this experience where a woman parked in a\nSpeaker 2: tollway zone and I said, hey, you know, you're going to get towed. And she turned around and called him a bunch of choice names, which kind of ended up in and you'd better go back to Mexico and stop taking our jobs.\nSpeaker 2: I work with a young Muslim woman who earlier this year was really excited and telling me how she and her husband are taking the trip of a lifetime. And they've been studying here in Alameda. I live in Oakland now and they were taking this trip because they were going to be pregnant, start their family by the end\nSpeaker 2: of the year. The day after the election, in tears, she told me that they've decided not to have children because they don't want their children ending up in a camp. That is my personal story on ignorance. Is dangerous.\nSpeaker 2: Do the right thing and protect everybody. Thank you, Deborah Auerbach.\nSpeaker 8: Deborah and then Austin.\nSpeaker 0: And then our last speakers downward.\nSpeaker 3: Mayor Council.\nSpeaker 0: I was very.\nSpeaker 3: Pleased to see this on the agenda tonight. I think it's a great idea. I think the time. It is the time. If we do not do something like this, we'll be on the wrong side of history. This is what we need.\nSpeaker 3: We are a nation of immigrants. Now. My family came here in the 1700s. I've only been in Alameda 25 years. But I love the diversity here. I wouldn't trade it. And what part of that is, is that we protect each other.\nSpeaker 3: We take care of each other. We don't pick and choose and say, Oh, I'm better than you are, or I didn't get mine. So, okay, all of you better go. That's been done. And they talked about I mean, Reverend.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, you just talked about how they had them in internment camps. They had him down at the racetrack in the stalls. And so people think, oh, that will never happen. Well, it has happened and it's happened more than once.\nSpeaker 3: And it could happen again so easily. And we could be so righteous. So. Forward thinking at this point to think make this a sanctuary city. I believe with all my heart that is the proper thing to do. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Austin, Sam and then Daniel. And there there are a lot of speakers. If you'd like to speak on this item, please submit your slip.\nSpeaker 7: First of all, I want to thank council members, somebody for bringing up this important resolution and referral. This is this resolution is much needed, especially in this America, that this race is America that we are headed towards. Especially I have been disturbed from what I've heard from some of the speakers tonight and from hearing that what makes\nSpeaker 7: me fight harder? With with heavy blood and and tears in that I have in my body and I we really need this sanctuary city for Alameda because of the rhetoric we have heard in this election and the much of the rhetoric that has caused much hate crimes around the country.\nSpeaker 7: And when it comes to everyone belongs here, whether it's LGBTQ people or people who are in the able. I also want to bring to your attention the issue of housing and especially affordable housing and people who are facing evictions.\nSpeaker 7: If you're talking about families being separated and families being torn apart, we cannot not neglect that as well. I feel like we, you know, due to Austin, I feel like this community and the city council has lost leadership when it comes to people facing evictions.\nSpeaker 7: When we have seen and seen this happening, unfortunately too much in this community. And most most of all, I'm just. I just want to give my support to this bill. And we have your back. I mean, let me guarantee you, we have your back.\nSpeaker 7: We have your back. The thousands of other people who could not be here today. And I can guarantee you that if they could be here, they would be standing here and. And fighting the rhetoric of what? Is what is yet to unfold in this country that we call a democracy.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker stand with. And then he's our last speaker on this item.\nSpeaker 4: Hello, Mary. Members of the council. I did not plan on speaking here tonight. I really just came here to congratulate our new and returning council members. But I thought I would stick around for this. And I was expecting maybe to hear people debating the fine points of certain aspects of this issue.\nSpeaker 4: But I had to. I wanted to speak briefly, because I just found that the opponents to this seem to be really hijacking the frame of what this is all about. The issue of illegal immigrants and comprehensive immigration reform is really an issue at a national level.\nSpeaker 4: And I think for another day, this is not what this is about. This is about a rerun of what happened in the time of World War Two, some horrible things that happened. You know, now that Trump is elected, people tend to.\nSpeaker 4: You know, there are a lot people saying, oh, give him a chance and so on. He you know, it's just all a lot of hot air, a lot of rhetoric. And yet that's what people in the news, the newspapers and so on were saying in the United States about the leadership in Germany in the 1930s.\nSpeaker 4: They just thought, oh, you know, he's just blowing a lot of hot air. And, you know, I learned recently that the Japanese in Japanese-American internment camps were created not through an act of Congress, but just through executive order.\nSpeaker 4: Franklin Roosevelt generally a hero of mine, but in this case, he just, you know, under political pressure, he put his orders into into position. And that's what happened. We started rounding up our citizens because of this fear and prejudice.\nSpeaker 4: As you can see, I'm not here as part of an anti-immigrant, organized opposition using visual aids designed to tug at your heartstrings, even if they're truly heartbreaking stories. What I'm hearing is prejudice. What I'm hearing is straw man arguments from the opposition.\nSpeaker 4: And I think all of you know, history and, you know, understand your history a lot better. Also, just since I have a moment, since I have a moment, I want to tell speakers in the future when you're speaking, there's a little yellow light here that tells you you're almost at a time.\nSpeaker 4: And then when there's a loud beep, it means that you're supposed to be done. So that that way we don't have the council meetings go on too long. So I believe I'm not out of time. I'm going to finish.\nSpeaker 4: Shirley, thank you so much. Thank you. All right.\nSpeaker 0: So he's our last speaker. This is number seven for us. We'd like to speak first.\nSpeaker 6: I think I said most everything. I'll hear what my colleagues say and then make some closing remarks if needed.\nSpeaker 0: Me. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 3: You know, I hear the concerns about the economy and about, you know, what's happening with our workforce. And, you know, I think none of us here will will argue that we could do more to help economic development. I think that there's a lot of intent up here to actually work on job creation in Alameda and make sure\nSpeaker 3: that there's a pathway to the middle class and make sure that we're we're finding places for the job development to occur. But I also heard some comments that that I think were a little bit. Based on some some misguided fears or perhaps, you know, didn't acknowledge the fact that we currently first of all, we don't have a\nSpeaker 3: jail here in the city of Alameda. So the concerns about releasing, you know, somebody who's committed a crime where there's been probable cause and they're being detained awaiting trial or something like that is just not something that we would even be dealing with here, simply for the fact that we transfer everybody to Santa Rita.\nSpeaker 3: But also the fact that this is already a policy within our police department. And I think that from my perspective as a council member, I think we need to make sure that we're backing up our police chief and we're backing up our police officers and making sure that they feel that that they're acting in accordance not just\nSpeaker 3: with department policy, but also with the city policy. You know. I wear this every day and it has Executive Order 9066 on it. And it's to remind me that, you know, there have been times where, you know, history is rife with tragedies that occurred because good people who sat in positions of power did nothing.\nSpeaker 3: You know, I have family who were interned. And I think that we, you know, people who lived through that live live it and carry it with them for the rest of their lives. My former roommate, who's a teacher here in Alameda and has been a teacher for many years, is Muslim.\nSpeaker 3: And, you know, one of her concerns for her students, because she's had students who come up to her, is making sure that we actually are doing something to encourage and reassure everybody here that when they use city services, when they go to get a permit or they report a crime, that their information is not going to be\nSpeaker 3: turned over for some list or registry. And I absolutely think that this is a local issue and it's a local issue because it impacts everybody who's in our community in whatever capacity that may be, whether they live here, they work here, they go to school here.\nSpeaker 3: We have many students at the College of Alameda who have been very active and proactive on this issue. And I don't think that, you know, saying that everybody belongs here is enough. I think we need to reassure them in a way that is concrete and that shows them that we as a city have actually taken steps to\nSpeaker 3: make sure that they don't have to go register or anything like that. And I think that it's about being prepared for what could come and having something in place and making sure that all of our city staff are on the same page.\nSpeaker 3: So so from that perspective, I think that, you know, I think it's absolutely, you know, the right thing to do. And it will, you know, ensure that everybody's on the same page and that people continue to use all of the great services that we have.\nSpeaker 3: And they know that they're welcome there. I'm Brad.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mary Spencer. The Today I sat down and talked with our police chief, Popolare, who in the back of the room because I wanted to talk with him about the implications of declaring Alameda a sanctuary city. And by the way, we discussed Kate Stanley in that meeting, and I'll back up just a little bit and tell\nSpeaker 0: you that I am both the daughter and granddaughter of immigrants. And without belaboring the point, my father's family actually wasn't admitted to the United States when they came from Syria, as a matter of fact. But they were admitted to Canada.\nSpeaker 0: And later, before World War Two, he came to this country, became a naturalized U.S. citizen to serve in the US Navy during World War Two and you know, eventually got his citizenship, went through the process. If my father were alive today, knowing him as I did, I think he would support the sort of policy we're discussing.\nSpeaker 0: But I just want to clarify a few things. First of all, and I talked to my council colleague, Giamatti, earlier this week, and I, I commended the wording of this, what we're doing tonight. This is a council referral.\nSpeaker 0: We're not voting on a resolution. We're not doing an amendment. We are directing staff. If if a majority of the council votes, we will direct staff to return to draft and return to the Council. An analysis of declaring Alameda St Sanctuary City including what all the implications are.\nSpeaker 0: Now, when I met with Chief Hilary and Vice Mayor Vella also touched on this. We do have policies in place now that the police follow with regard to what they do and don't report to ICE. However, I also have a law enforcement background and I said I couldn't support a policy that somehow was protecting people who'd committed\nSpeaker 0: crimes and violent, violent crimes because after all, in Alameda, we pride ourselves on being a safe city. And that's because we have a wonderful police department. I think we unanimously agree on that. And also we do things like have housing that we provide for victims of domestic abuse and violent crimes.\nSpeaker 0: And we're not we're not walking that back, I'm quite sure. And the other thing I want to just mention is I don't know if any of you saw Mike McMahon, former member of the school board, posted on a local blog a link to an article in the Orange County Register that talked about sanctuary city, what it is\nSpeaker 0: and what it isn't. Did you know? Because I didn't. There's no legal term. Sanctuary city. It's thrown about. What does it mean? It has no legal implication. Well, we have the opportunity to do in Alameda, however, is to fashion a resolution, perhaps if that's the will of the council and listening to the people that reflects our values\nSpeaker 0: and your concerns. And and I have to say, this was a great discussion. It was there was a lot of passion on both sides. For the most part. I think you were all very respectful. Probably if we did a little less applause, we wouldn't be here quite so late.\nSpeaker 0: But that's for another day. However, I have also heard I'm had an email and I'm sure the rest of the council did. From a gentleman in town who's a veteran, he's concerned. What would the implications be if the federal government were to pull funding from, say, the the VA, you know, and then alongside the Northwest Territories at\nSpeaker 0: Alameda Point, we have a VA clinic that is is planned. I'm not going to do the legal analysis, but I will say that's still federal property because they didn't give it to us. But. But anyway, that's something to to consider.\nSpeaker 0: And that's something that I would want staff to look into. I would certainly want staff to be doing the analysis in conjunction with the police chief because he's extremely knowledgeable about state law. There is organizations of police chiefs that analyze all the various laws that that have to do with these kinds of policies.\nSpeaker 0: So we can, you know, we're not reinventing the wheel. And the other thing that impels me to say we need to take a stand is two things. I have a friend who teaches at Ruby Bridges, one of our schools on the West End, large immigrant population.\nSpeaker 0: Even before the the election, she had kindergartners and first graders coming to her and saying, Ms.. So-and-so, her first name. What's going to happen to my family? Are my parents going to be sent back if if Trump is elected?\nSpeaker 0: And I don't think anybody has an interest in dividing families. Ed Wood Middle School, one of our middle schools in town, another large immigrant population there to hold a special assembly the day after the election because the kids were so upset about what does it mean?\nSpeaker 0: So if we have a way to clarify and to talk about, you know, this is what we do in Alameda, this is what we don't do. I think that's that's something that is is very much worth looking into, how we could go about it.\nSpeaker 0: And, of course, the others, you know, affirming the rights of individuals based on religious beliefs, lv g t Q rights, religious freedoms and on and on. And then the other thing, and it's been mentioned before is the internment camps during World War Two.\nSpeaker 0: And so Reverend Yoshi always speaks very eloquently. We've known each other for years, but it's true. The point of to United Methodist Church, just a couple of blocks from City Hall, has a courtyard if you've ever been to their festival in the spring.\nSpeaker 0: And in that courtyard, there's pictures in the in the social hall, photographs of it was like a campground where people were camping, because when they came back to Alameda, their homes were no longer here. It wasn't as though they were held in trust.\nSpeaker 0: I went to school at UC Davis. Some of my classmates were Japanese-American students, the sons and daughters of farmers in the Central Valley whose families bought back their farmland when they returned from being interned. And so it makes me stop and think as an elected official, a newly reelected public official, is there a time to stand up\nSpeaker 0: ? I mean, I'm a lawyer. I'm law abiding. I believe in the rule, in the power of law. But there is a time to stand up and say, you know, we need to clarify what our values are. And I do think the tent is big enough to encompass the concerns of the people who spoke out in opposition.\nSpeaker 0: We are not going to have 100% agreement on this, but I very much heard and respected what you have to say, and I share many of those concerns. But I will most definitely support directing staff to analyze this and all the implications.\nSpeaker 0: We certainly want to make sure that we're clear on the funding that we need for our affordable housing, how we go about doing what we do, how we're already doing, some of what is being asked for, and whether that just needs to be clarified or set forth in a resolution or whatever the final document is.\nSpeaker 0: But I think it's very much the time and the place to do this. Thank you. Member matter. I see that you want to speak at this point.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, I do. I think this referral is worth moving forward. I think that the San Francisco resolution probably doesn't apply. We are not a city and county. The incident that happened in San Francisco that kicked loose a person who eventually killed somebody is not relevant to Alameda because we we do not maintain the jail and we do\nSpeaker 5: not maintain a district attorney who makes those decisions of what we all did. And you heard it four times tonight is we all swore an oath. Of office that involved upholding the Constitution. And we have a president elect who was reported during the campaign to excuse me to.\nSpeaker 5: Challenge the 14th Amendment. So what I'd like this to consider are some practical, you know, resolutions are fine, we all feel good, and we move on. I like the idea of codifying as city policy the policy that the police department has made on their own, as an operating policy, which I think speaks highly of our police department\nSpeaker 5: . And our police department is very diligent in making sure that violent people don't get kicked loose. I think that's a good approach to take to this. It's practical. It's already an operating policy, and there's no convincing the police that it has to be done because this is their policy.\nSpeaker 5: And it also guarantees that we won't have to Fillory forever, that this becomes then a mandate for, uh, for future police departments. I think that's very important in protecting the safety of Alameda, but also taking a evenhanded approach to this.\nSpeaker 5: I think also that it's almost more important that we know what the requests from the federal government are rather than trying to to carve out and pick something from San Francisco, something from Oakland. What's really important to me is that I don't want to spend one minute of City Resource Time, Police Library or whatever it is on\nSpeaker 5: a constitutionally questionable request from the federal government. And I think it's going to be more insidious then. I mean, the the on both sides, there was a lot of dramatic representations of what could happen and what has happened.\nSpeaker 5: But what I'm really afraid of is we're going to get a request to the from Homeland Security, the police department, or we want you to send us all of your scanned license plate reader outputs, or we want to see all of your body cam.\nSpeaker 5: Or some other kind of insidious requests that's going to be used for things that that are unconstitutional. And I'd like to anchor this in the Constitution. Probable cause and equal protection under the law are the right of all persons in the United States.\nSpeaker 5: That's what the Constitution doesn't say, citizens. It says persons. And that has been upheld. In courts many, many times, and it's our responsibility to do that. So that's the direction. That I would like to add to the discussion and for staff to consider how do we convey that?\nSpeaker 5: And I think that would. That would address some of the comments that were made about the downsides of sanctuary cities. Right. Number one is analysis of of the financial impact. I think that's important to know, but. On some level, upholding the Constitution is more important.\nSpeaker 5: And financial impact. But we still need the analysis. And as far as the VA facility goes, that was promised. It's being held up in Congress. We need to fight to get it kicked loose. And that's a separate issue.\nSpeaker 5: And we should fight as hard as we can to make sure that that facility happens at me point. I don't think this is going to, you know, harm it. I think we need to have a parallel track on working on that.\nSpeaker 5: That's my comment.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So I want to share. This is actually the second meeting, public meeting that I have attended where these issues have been spoken about. We have a social service human relations Board that was started by our community, by the our city council back in August 1977, when our mayor was Chuck Ricca.\nSpeaker 0: And the duties and this is part of our charter under our charter social service, human relations board advises council. And I think it covers issues like these. My preference would be to honor the Shrubs request, which is also part of our charter.\nSpeaker 0: The charter provides that it's the intent of this ordinance that city council and board will meet at least once a year to review the plan. And there is supposed to be a plan for the performance of the above listed functions with the advice and consent of City Council.\nSpeaker 0: So. My recommendation would be that we honor our charter, which includes Shrub, as part of this process. So and in fact, Shrub has also already weighed in on these issues, which was to and there were 80. There estimate was more than 80 people were in attendance at the special meeting.\nSpeaker 0: So we seem to have two tracts here that I think it's important we bring together. There was a special meeting back on November 29th and it was specifically noticed by Shrub and the comments were it was for public input regarding coordination of positive community responses to bias motivated actions and other events affecting Alameda and and the nation\nSpeaker 0: . And Councilmember, former councilmember de and myself attended that meeting. As far as I know, no other members of council were there.\nSpeaker 3: However, I.\nSpeaker 0: Think it was a very productive meeting. There were many perspectives shared and at that time, so there were more than 80 in attendance, including myself, former Councilmember De Saag, Alameda Unified School District Superintendent Shawn McFetridge, who we have the city and the school district, have worked closely on these issues.\nSpeaker 0: City manager Joe Mack, our police chief, Larry. Our public information officer, Sarah Henry, who has also been part of this process to make sure that we're getting the word out, as well as members of our faith based community.\nSpeaker 0: Dr. Laura Rose, Sister Pat Nagle, Reverend Lundgren. And we also had members from PTA, as well as our meetings coming together, members of AUC, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer Questioning Roundtable. So my suggestion would be that we include these points, some of which are already on the list from Shrub.\nSpeaker 0: And then make sure that they are all specifically included. And then hold which they are requesting a joint meeting of the Council and Shrub to be set sometime in early 2017, consistent with our charter as part is their request, and I believe that is in fact what the charter provides that the issues like this that we work\nSpeaker 0: closely with Shrub. So that is my suggestion that we honor the charter, add these additional requests if there are any that are considered additional and set up a joint meeting with Shrub at the early part of 2017. Madam Chair.\nSpeaker 0: Yes? Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 6: Summarize. So I do want to thank everyone for. I'm sorry, Madam Chair, just to kind of recap, I appreciate all the passion and all the energy and all of the respectful comments by the public. And I am, you know, overwhelmed that, you know, at least it sounds like three of my other colleagues are prepared to move this\nSpeaker 6: forward. So I do want to say that, you know, every person that said thank you to me, I want to pass that on to you. I do agree with the comments, but I must cut you off. Highsmith. I council member Matt, R-S.C..\nSpeaker 6: You know, the San Francisco reservoir was meant to be a model. It wasn't meant to the cut and paste. And if that's something that, you know, this council wants to have the shrub work on and, you know, kind of make it specific to Alameda, I mean, that's fine.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, that's a statement of values. And, you know, I don't know if there's an urgency on that by January 20th. And I agree with the comments about, you know, making sure that, you know, if there's some violent criminal that they're not put out on the streets.\nSpeaker 6: But I do think there's a sense of urgency. You know, we have to take the man at his word. He promised this would be one of his first things to do. And if we don't have something in place and it's our responsibility as a city council to set those policies, then I don't think we can afford to\nSpeaker 6: wait. So I do appreciate all the comments and other suggestions and thank you for standing up for our community.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So now if I can ask. Thank you. So what I was going to say is I appreciate your recap of the Shrub meeting. I didn't attend. I was out of the country then, but I read the letter.\nSpeaker 0: We all got it. I think it's fine for us to hold a joint meeting with this shrub sometime after the first of the year, but it doesn't preclude what is being asked in this council referral tonight. And I think we should move forward.\nSpeaker 0: I think perhaps Councilmember Madison might want to add I like the I mean, it's obviously the prerogative of the author, but I like the added direction that Councilmember Maher gave.\nSpeaker 5: I would like to also ask that I think this could be a long process coming up with a resolution. There's going to be more public meetings. People are going to weigh in just like they did tonight and the discussion will go on.\nSpeaker 5: I think it's very important and probably more valuable. In the immediate to have notification to the City Council of any request from the Federal Government. I don't know how to term it, but that is constitutionally questionable because I don't what I don't want to have happen is, is that there's this creeping creeping invasion into things that have\nSpeaker 5: have been put out. There is the extreme because, you know, we have the example of internment. We have the example of registering Muslims. I don't think it's going to happen like that, but I'm afraid it's going to happen and we're all going to be asleep at the wheel on.\nSpeaker 5: So I would like to get an opinion or a commitment and to see if that's that's something that can reasonably done be done, that this council gets notice so that we can if something comes up, the public knows and we'll know and we can make a decision on whether, yes, that's in the best interest of Alameda and\nSpeaker 5: it seems to be constitutional or no, this is this is a violation. This is moving moving that challenge to the 14th Amendment, as was promised. And I think that's, you know, the the referral. I'd like it to go forward, but I do think it should have that component and maybe get that immediate.\nSpeaker 2: You have my and the city attorney and all staff's absolute commitment to let the council and the public know if there is anything questionable that were asked on the federal government. What I'm also hearing is a difference in timing.\nSpeaker 2: This is a long process to get it right. We have a couple of options. One option is we can reconfirm our existing police policies and bring it to council as a resolution and and add other sections. Or we can spend more time or we could actually do both, but we could spend more time with public input and\nSpeaker 2: working out the details of it.\nSpeaker 5: And I'd like to hearing that. I'd like to make a motion. I'd like to. Move that we support the council referral and directing staff to return to the Council. The four points that are listed here in addition to acknowledge and accept.\nSpeaker 5: The commitment from city management. That questionable request from the Federal Government will be reported to the Council for Public Discussion. And what I. And that's that's my motion and the how to do it. You'd come back to us, correct?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 5: So that's my emotion. And it considers in addition to the four here, what was mentioned is the adoption of the policy that the police department has put together as a as either a part of this immediate, however it goes.\nSpeaker 3: Can can we can we get. I just want to clarify what would constitute questionable. Is that something that would include a request for information that contains private or personal information by members of the public? That's a request. Request for a large amount of information or.\nSpeaker 2: Well, there is a difference between a request, a public information request, correct. We don't give private information out. But if it's a request also from the federal government that says like has already happened on some departments of. Tell us who attended the climate at the climate change conference which employees have, you know, done this kind of work\nSpeaker 2: . That kind of stuff would definitely rise to it. There is. But a public request, individual request is different.\nSpeaker 3: I just wanted to clarify for this benefit of the.\nSpeaker 0: Audio and just for further education climate, you were just using a hypothetical if someone were to ask for that information, right. We haven't been asked for. Right. Right. Because I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure that was complete. Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Using it as an example, a hypothetical. And we don't give out that kind of information.\nSpeaker 4: Mm.\nSpeaker 0: There were already.\nSpeaker 6: So I like to second the councilmembers motion, but I think A, B and C need to be brought back before January 20th. So, you know, we have preventative measures in place and if item de is it that I do one, two, three, four.\nSpeaker 6: I'm sorry. One, two and three. If item four needs to percolate more, you know, through the shroud, through a joint meeting, you know, as a statement of our values and our commitments. I mean, we don't have to have that in immediately.\nSpeaker 6: If that's okay with a maker of the motion.\nSpeaker 4: If it's.\nSpeaker 0: A girl.\nSpeaker 4: Is it?\nSpeaker 6: Well, I've heard that I'm meant to collaborate with everybody gets as.\nSpeaker 5: Long as we get the laws, we get the reporting. Of of.\nSpeaker 3: Anything, I mean.\nSpeaker 5: Of untoward requests from the federal government. I think if we lay out a timeline, if we hit the timeline, that's fine. That's a goal. We don't hit the timeline. We'll take the time to get it done right. But at least we'll know when the request comes and we can act on that immediate request.\nSpeaker 5: That's my intention.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. And can I just share some practical information? So, A, for us to get this on January 17th, it has to be written in the next two days. We will do what we can and see how far we get.\nSpeaker 2: But the information is not going to be a very deep analysis we have. We've already collected the information of federal funds that we use annually, and we can provide that information and we'll do it to the best of our ability.\nSpeaker 2: We do have after the holiday, we have, you know, a week in there for legal review and manager review. So there is like maybe seven days that we have to do this.\nSpeaker 5: And I would like to get it done right. And that's why it's important to get the report in, because if something happens in the time where we're trying to work this out. There's something. It can be addressed immediately and we can still continue the process.\nSpeaker 5: That's our insurance, in my opinion.\nSpeaker 0: So just remember. Ashcroft So thank you for clarification. I mean, I would be inclined to say this could come back to us. The first meeting in February, in order to give staff adequate time going into the holidays to research this.\nSpeaker 0: With. I mean, you have the safeguard that we can be notified. That can be a staff direction of some untoward request, whether or not there's a council meeting to further discuss. But I just I mean, I would go for quality and quantity of information rather than speed.\nSpeaker 0: My preference. Would I agree in regards to member captain, uh, member matter. Um, I will not be here. Well, actually, I'll be here January 17th, but I won't be able to stay up until the middle of the night or anything like that, because that is actually the same week as the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which I will\nSpeaker 0: be attending. So I have a plane to catch. I think actually, like at 1 a.m. in San Francisco that evening or early that morning, so that I return to the meeting. Which which is correct. However, I would like to be able to participate in a certain things important to share that I already have plans to not.\nSpeaker 2: Be able.\nSpeaker 0: To be here throughout the middle of the night on that time. And I do think it's important that I agree. I agree that it would be important to do to do this correctly. And also, firstly, I think it's important that we include Shrub somehow, because that is actually there for our charter.\nSpeaker 0: That is. But it's not as it falls under something that that's why they were created shrub was created to intended. The intent is to create.\nSpeaker 3: An environment.\nSpeaker 0: Which will encourage and bring about mutual understanding, respect and goodwill among groups of people in the community and to improve social services within our community. And they have started this process. So are we planning, you know, so if in the motion in a second, if I recall correctly.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Do we have to do our 11:00? Great thing.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. So I was just passed the slip. 11 p.m.. We need a motion for three 5/2 to continue the meeting past 11. We have a motion in a second. All those in favor. My motion carries unanimously. Thank you for that.\nSpeaker 6: I guess my concern is that, you know, if this happens, it's going to happen fast and we should make do our level best to get the three protections that are in the referral on the agenda by by the 17th.\nSpeaker 6: You know, I know that there's some issues on what funds are at risk. But, you know, I did have a meeting with high level attorney general, people from the state of California, and they said that really the only thing that is at risk, the federal government withholding our law enforcement related dollars like COPS grants, which we don't\nSpeaker 6: receive any, so things like HUD and V.A. and Safer grants and things like that. I mean, they're not really at risk. And if, you know, that's something that the new government decides to go after, you know, it's going to be more than just the city of Alameda that's going to be fighting that.\nSpeaker 6: So I really don't want to be in a position where we come back, the first meeting in February. And, you know, we have an order from the federal government to register Muslims and we we don't have a policy in place to stop it.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, that's you know, it's that's why I brought this today. And I've got to wait until the first of the year. But that's why I did this today, so we can get this in before the 20th of Nebraska.\nSpeaker 0: So I while I appreciate that you had a high level conference with folks from the attorney general's office, I I'm also wanting to hear from our legal staff about the implications. And those are those are things that will come back and be shared by with the entire council in some written form.\nSpeaker 0: I mean. Is there? I mean, do you see any way that we can still have a thorough analysis and yet have the protections in place that.\nSpeaker 6: I have confidence in our staff.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Mendez, he looks like he has a dressing room.\nSpeaker 5: And I think if we can consider to to answer your question, if we on the 21st got an order, the Army is going to register Muslims. We would have that on the council because it would be a reporter.\nSpeaker 5: We would have that on a council meeting, special meeting of the council. And this council would. I would think would vote no and. The same thing. If we're asked for something a little less dramatic, like alchemy, just going to turn over all of the library, check in records to the computers or all of the books checked out\nSpeaker 5: . We would say no. And that's.\nSpeaker 0: Why I already.\nSpeaker 4: Said yes. We've already said that once.\nSpeaker 5: But I think to to address your concern there. That's why I was saying asking staff, please commit to reporting this to the council. If the council gets notice of this will we'll discuss it and we'll we'll decline to spend city money on doing something as ridiculous as registering people based on religious belief or based on what book\nSpeaker 5: they take out of the library. So I think that that's the intention of put of me putting that in there.\nSpeaker 3: So. Vice Mayor So is your intention to have this heard than the first meeting in February or is the is the intention whenever they have adequate staff, has adequate time to research?\nSpeaker 5: Well, I would defer to staff on what the date the date is that this practically can be done. And then notice according to the Sunshine Ordinance.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, I think part of I guess my my opinion is that it's our job to prioritize. And so I would like this to be a priority. And wouldn't you know, from my perspective, I think this should be a top priority.\nSpeaker 3: I think we all have expressed that concern. And so to that extent, I think, you know, maybe seven days isn't long enough. But I certainly wouldn't want this lingering past the first meeting in February.\nSpeaker 0: So if I could address Member Ashcraft, I think, you know, it's certainly fair to prioritize, but I know there's some other fairly significant issues percolating too, and some of them are time critical. I would think the first meeting in February would give adequate time.\nSpeaker 3: For.\nSpeaker 0: Her staff. And, you know, with the added protection of a special meeting that can be called if if necessary, from there.\nSpeaker 2: We we can do the first meeting of February. The other option that the city and I were just talking about is if this council has the desire to have the joint meeting with the Shrub and the city council, we could present it at the last.\nSpeaker 2: You know, whatever the date is at the very end of January, there's five weeks in January. Oh, but that's presented.\nSpeaker 0: But then we'd be crafting yet something else that we'd have to go back. I really do want to.\nSpeaker 2: So we will in and it sounds like the council is available for the first week of February and we'll strive for that. It's a we it's a high priority for the community and for the council.\nSpeaker 6: What we strive for the 17th. But if it goes to the first week.\nSpeaker 4: Can't stay long.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, that would be okay.\nSpeaker 0: So I want to clarify, do our council members think that they would be here on the first? That was the question from city manager, the first meeting in February, I guess. And I also heard member already that the priority is.\nSpeaker 0: In January, January 17th, I believe was the date. So we have a motion, but I think there is some disagreement on the date that it comes back. I'm hearing that you just asked us if we were available the first meeting in February.\nSpeaker 6: And I mean, just 2.1 last thing. I mean, I appreciate Schrum and the input they would have in reaffirming our commitment to our values. But police policy is the purview of city council. The police chief reports to the city manager who reports to the city council.\nSpeaker 0: So city manager. Okay. City manager, could you clarify regarding whose per is the so the.\nSpeaker 2: Policy 4 to 8 and the police chief is here if he wants to add to this is administrative policy. So it's done at a staff level. If the council chooses to reconfirm this, it could come as a resolution and that would make it a priority, you know, and under the purview of the city council.\nSpeaker 2: So right now it's this is done at a staff level.\nSpeaker 6: There's nothing that Shrub does that doesn't make police policy. I mean, that's kind of my point.\nSpeaker 2: Right? No. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: So I just want that to be clear.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So. But the motion to have it on the January 17th or February. Uh, this is the very seventh.\nSpeaker 6: I think we strive.\nSpeaker 4: For. I think.\nSpeaker 0: The motion.\nSpeaker 5: The motion doesn't have to date. I think we heard from the city manager that she's going to do it. He's going to work as quickly as possible. And if. And be thorough. And I think there's heads nodding there.\nSpeaker 5: But you'll be here February 1st, so I'll call for the question.\nSpeaker 0: The seventh would be the.\nSpeaker 4: First the first week of February.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Sorry. All right. So I'd like us. If our city clerk could repeat the motion.\nSpeaker 1: Supporting the referral and directing staff to return with the four points, acknowledging and accepting the city manager comments. And if a question is from the Federal Government that it would be reported to council immediately, and then how it would be done would come back to council and including adoption of the police.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: What member Ashcroft? I think it was if a constitutionally questionable oh three was out there.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then. So this this is simply a referral. Staff can clarify when when this comes back. And at that time, council will decide whether or not to. How to decide each of these issues. So for the benefit of those in the audience of the referral process versus actually making a decision on the merits.\nSpeaker 6: You know, that would be. When it came back, we would have an analysis and a resolution.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, I want people to understand that. So we were not for making a decision on each of these points at this time. But we are asking is that staff come back with information pertaining to these and at that time, as one council would make a decision how to proceed on the merits of each of these issues.\nSpeaker 0: We are not deciding tonight any of these issues. We are asking staff to come back. And at that time, everyone that spoke and everyone that has spoken in the past that the prior meeting would have another opportunity to speak on the merits at that time.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So so you would have that opportunity whenever this comes back and.\nSpeaker 6: You know that. That's correct. And hopefully it would come back with a resolution that we could vote on, yes or no.\nSpeaker 0: All those in favor. I though the reform passes was unanimous to have the referral come back to us through a council meeting.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Now to come back to our agenda. Are we.\nSpeaker 6: Almost done?\nSpeaker 0: All right. Council Communications ten. So we are now on agenda item ten. Council Communications. Are there any comments that council would like? Any members of council would like to share at this time? Already done. So thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Good.\nSpeaker 0: But happy holiday to everybody. I'll say that.\nSpeaker 5: To the council.\nSpeaker 4: Welcome back.\nSpeaker 0: So happy holidays to each and every one of you we look forward to. Ah, this is the last meeting of the year for us, so we look forward to seeing you all next year. Happy holidays. This meeting is now adjourned and it's 10 minutes after 11.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\n",
